Question:
What motivated Raju to become a firefighter after witnessing a fire at his school?

Options:
a. His desire for financial gain.
b. His experience of teachers helping students during the fire.
c. His interest in volunteering for community service.
d. His goal to teach students about safety.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the cause–effect in the scenario — Raju witnessed a fire at his school and saw how others reacted.  
Step 2: Determine what specifically inspired him — the passage emphasizes that he was moved by seeing teachers helping students, which motivated him to become a firefighter. Therefore the correct choice is b.

Why the other options are incorrect:
- a (financial gain): there is no mention of money or earnings as a motive.  
- c (interest in volunteering): while related, the text specifies inspiration from the teachers’ rescue actions leading him to firefighting, not a generic volunteer drive.  
- d (goal to teach safety): the motive was to rescue/protect, not to become a teacher of safety.

Options:
a. He writes stories about firefighters.
b. He teaches new firefighters about safety.
c. He visits schools to talk about fire safety.
d. He focuses solely on putting out fires.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question focus — it asks how Raju contributes to fire safety education outside his firefighting duties. The option that explicitly describes outreach to the public is "visits schools to talk about fire safety."

Step 2: Eliminate other choices: option a (writes stories about firefighters) is not mentioned; option b (teaches new firefighters about safety) is an on-duty training role, not an outside-public activity; option d (focuses solely on putting out fires) contradicts contributing to education.

Therefore the correct answer is: c.

Options:
a. He initially had a different job.
b. He now earns money for his work.
c. He no longer teaches about fire safety.
d. He only puts out fires now.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
১) প্রশ্নে বলা হয়েছে Raju-এর ভিন্ন দুটি ভূমিকা — একজন firefighter এবং একজন volunteer firefighter — এদের মধ্যে পার্থক্য নির্ণয় করতে হবে। সাধারণভাবে "volunteer firefighter" হলো স্বেচ্ছাসেবক, অর্থাৎ বেতন নেওয়া হয় না, আর পেশাদার firefighter সাধারণত কাজের বিনিময়ে বেতন পান।  
২) তাই মূল পার্থক্য হল তিনি এখন তার কাজের জন্য পারিশ্রমিক পাচ্ছেন; এটিই সরাসরি বিকল্প b-কে নির্দেশ করে।  
৩) অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলোকে বাতিল করলে দেখা যায়: a (তিনি আগে আলাদা চাকরি করতেন) প্রশ্নে বলা হয়নি, c (তিনি আগুন নিরাপত্তা শেখানো বন্ধ করেছেন) এবং d (তিনি শুধু আগুন নেভাচ্ছেন) — এসব তথ্য উৎসে নেই।  
সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: b.

Question:
What can be inferred about Raju's feelings towards his job as a firefighter and educator?

Options:
a. He dislikes his job and prefers to volunteer.
b. He enjoys both firefighting and teaching.
c. He only values teaching over firefighting.
d. He is indifferent to both roles.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: 
Step 1 — Identify the evidence: the passage describes Raju actively doing firefighting duties and also teaching others, and it notes his enthusiasm and satisfaction in both roles.  
Step 2 — Infer feelings: enjoying both activities and taking pride in them implies he likes being both a firefighter and an educator.  
Step 3 — Eliminate other options: option (a) contradicts the described enjoyment; (c) is wrong because he values firefighting too, not only teaching; (d) is wrong because he is not indifferent but engaged and positive.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b): He enjoys both firefighting and teaching.

Which statement best summarizes Raju's approach to working with students regarding fire safety?

Options:
a. He believes students should panic in emergencies.
b. He teaches students to leave quietly during a fire.
c. He instructs students to ignore their teachers.
d. He does not engage with students about fire safety.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the stem to find Raju's described behavior toward students in a fire-safety situation — he trains them how to act during a fire.  
Step 2: Match that description to the options: option b says he teaches students to leave quietly during a fire, which directly fits a calm, orderly evacuation approach.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a (panic) is opposite of teaching orderly exit; option c (ignore teachers) conflicts with instruction; option d (does not engage) contradicts the fact that he teaches them.  

Therefore the correct answer is b.

Method: the passage describes him helping the fire service after college without being hired as a professional firefighter or instructor, which matches the role of a volunteer.

2. Compare each option to those duties: options a, b, and d match firefighter responsibilities, while option c, driving a school bus, does not.

Question:
During a fire, what does Raju advise students to do?

Options:
a. Stay calm and leave quietly
b. Run to the nearest exit
c. Call for help
d. Hide under their desks


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the scenario and identify the safest immediate action during a fire — prioritize orderly, safe evacuation to minimize panic and injury.  
Step 2: Raju’s advice is to "stay calm and leave quietly" because remaining calm helps people follow instructions and exit in an orderly way, reducing the risk of trampling or confusion.  
Step 3: Other options are less appropriate: running to the nearest exit can cause panic and collisions; calling for help may delay evacuation if help is not immediately available; hiding under desks is dangerous due to smoke and heat. Therefore option (a) is correct.

Question:
What happens when a verb has -er or -or added to it?

Options:
a. It describes an action
b. It creates an occupation noun
c. It becomes an adjective
d. It indicates a past tense


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize that adding the suffixes "-er" or "-or" to a verb typically forms an agent noun — a word that names the person who performs the action (examples: "teach" → "teacher", "drive" → "driver", "act" → "actor").  
Step 2: Therefore the result is an occupation or a person who does that action, so the correct choice is b.

Why the other options are incorrect:
- a is incorrect because the verb itself describes an action; adding "-er" or "-or" changes the verb into a noun naming the doer, not the action.  
- c is incorrect because while "-er" can form comparative adjectives from adjectives (e.g., "big" → "bigger"), when added to verbs it generally makes agent nouns, not adjectives.  
- d is incorrect because past tense is usually formed with "-ed" or by irregular forms, not by adding "-er" or "-or".

Question:
Why does Raju volunteer after college?

Options:
a. He enjoys helping others
b. He needs money
c. It's a job requirement
d. He wants to become famous


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the context and identify Raju’s motive—his actions and any stated feelings point to helping others, which matches option a.  
Step 2: Reasoning—volunteering after college is typically driven by altruism or enjoyment of service, so "He enjoys helping others" best explains his choice.  
Step 3: Elimination—option b ("He needs money") is unlikely because volunteering is generally unpaid, option c ("It's a job requirement") conflicts with the voluntary nature, and option d ("He wants to become famous") is not supported by evidence; therefore option a is correct.

Step 1: Read the passage carefully and locate sentences that describe Raju’s behavior during the fire.  
Step 2: Identify evidence: the passage indicates he remained calm and helped others (or followed evacuation procedures) rather than showing panic.  
Step 3: Conclusion — the statement “Raju panicked during the fire at his school” contradicts the passage, so the correct choice is b: False. Option a (True) is incorrect because it asserts panic, which is not supported by the described behavior.

Options:

b. Doctor
c. Chef
d. Teacher


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence "Raju became a __________ to help in emergencies." and identify the intended role — someone whose main duty is to respond to emergencies.  
Step 2: Compare options: a Firefighter, b Doctor, c Chef, d Teacher. A firefighter’s primary job is to respond to fires, accidents and rescue situations, so this fits the phrase best.  
Step 3: Eliminate others: a doctor treats medical emergencies but the phrase more directly implies emergency response and rescue work; a chef and a teacher do not have emergency-response duties.  
Therefore the correct answer is a: Firefighter.

Question:
What safety message does Raju convey to students?

Options:


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution: Read Raju’s exact words and identify the actionable instructions he gives. Step 1: Note the two key directives — “don’t panic” and “leave the building quietly,” which together advise a calm, orderly evacuation. Step 2: Infer the safety purpose: preventing panic and ensuring a safe, controlled exit reduces injury risk. Therefore the correct message is “Don’t panic and leave the building quietly.” Other possible options (e.g., “run,” “shout,” or “stay inside”) are unsafe because running can cause trampling, shouting can create confusion, and staying inside may trap people during an emergency.

Options:

Solution:

Step 1: Look for textual evidence about Raju’s attitude — the passage explicitly (or implicitly through positive words and actions) indicates he takes pleasure in training newcomers and speaks positively about mentoring.  
Step 2: From that positive wording and actions we infer he enjoys the activity, so the best match is option (c) "He enjoys it."  
Step 3: Options (a) "He dislikes it", (b) "He is indifferent", and (d) "He is unsure" contradict the positive evidence and are therefore incorrect.

Question:
Raju always received payment for his work as a firefighter.

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the statement "Raju always received payment" as a universal claim that in every instance he was paid.
Step 2: Universal claims require evidence for every case; without such evidence (or given that firefighters can be volunteers or miss payments), a single counterexample would make the statement false.
Conclusion: The statement is false, so the correct answer is b. Option a is incorrect because the word "always" is too strong and cannot be assumed true without proving every instance.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the part of speech needed — we need an adverb to modify the verb "leave."  
Step 2: Evaluate options: "panicked" is not a proper adverb here, so it is incorrect; "smoothly" and "quickly" are adverbs but convey different nuances.  
Step 3: "Quietly" best fits the likely context (teachers guiding students so as not to cause alarm or disturbance), so the correct choice is c: quietly.

Step 2: Verify why other options are incorrect — Police Department (a) refers to law enforcement, Teaching Department (c) refers to schools or education, and Health Department (d) refers to medical/public health services; none match the stated fire-volunteer role.

Step 2: Compare each option to that interpretation: option b ("He wanted to help others") matches the typical motive for volunteering.  
Step 3: Eliminate the rest: option a ("He didn't want to work") contradicts volunteering (it requires commitment), option c ("He was forced to join") contradicts the meaning of volunteer, and option d ("He wanted to earn lots of money") is unlikely because volunteers are not paid.

Step 2: Reasoning — panic typically impairs judgment and can cause stampedes or poor decisions, whereas correct guidance is to stay as calm as possible, follow evacuation procedures, and help others.  
Conclusion: The statement is false, so the correct answer is b. Option a is incorrect because panic increases danger rather than improving safety.

Question:
When Raju was in Class 5, there was a __________ at his school.

Options:
a. storm
b. fire
c. flood
d. earthquake


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Read the sentence: "When Raju was in Class 5, there was a __________ at his school." We choose the word that commonly collocates with "at his school" to describe an event that happened there. The best and most natural choice is "fire" — the phrase "there was a fire at his school" is a standard expression. 

Why others are less suitable: "storm" and "flood" usually affect a wider area ("there was a storm/flood in the area"), and "earthquake" is typically described as occurring in a region rather than "at" a specific building. Therefore option (b) fire is correct.

Question:
What advice does Raju give if there is a fire?

Options:


Correct Answer: Listen to teachers and leave quietly.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and locate Raju’s advice in the passage — he tells students what to do in case of a fire.
Step 2: Raju’s advice is to listen to the teachers and leave the building quietly; this keeps order and reduces the risk of injury.
Step 3: Other choices (for example, panicking, running recklessly, or hiding) are incorrect because they increase chaos and danger, whereas following teachers’ instructions ensures a safe, orderly evacuation.

Question:
What should a dressmaker do?

Options:
a. Bake bread
b. Make dresses
c. Teach students
d. Drive a bus


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: A dressmaker is someone who designs, cuts, and sews clothing, especially dresses. Step 1: Match the job description to the options — "make dresses" directly describes the primary work of a dressmaker. Step 2: Therefore option b is correct; options a (bake bread), c (teach students), and d (drive a bus) describe different occupations and do not match the duties of a dressmaker.

Step 2: Compare the claim with the given facts (from the source/problem): those facts do not state that Raju works as a part-time firefighter, so the claim is not supported.  
Step 3: Conclusion — the statement is false, so option b is correct; option a is incorrect because there is no evidence that Raju is a part-time firefighter.

Question:
Raju's job often involves __________ out fires.

Options:
a. teaching
b. putting
c. ignoring
d. watching


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the grammar: "involves" is followed by a gerund (verb+ing).  
Step 2: We need a verb that, with "out" and "fires", makes a correct phrasal verb: "put out fires" → gerund form "putting out fires". Hence option (b) "putting" fits: "Raju's job often involves putting out fires."  
Why the others are wrong: (a) "teaching" could grammatically follow "involves" but does not pair with "out fires"; (c) "ignoring" and (d) "watching" do not form the intended phrase "out fires" and do not convey the meaning of extinguishing fires.

Solution:

Therefore the correct answer is “He likes teaching.” Other possible reasons (such as good salary, pleasant workplace, or friendly colleagues) are incorrect because they are not mentioned as the cause of his enjoyment in the given text.

Question:
Raju earns money as a volunteer firefighter.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: A "volunteer firefighter" is someone who performs firefighting duties on a voluntary basis and typically does not receive a regular salary for that role.  
Step 2: The statement "Raju earns money as a volunteer firefighter" asserts that he is paid for that volunteer role; since volunteers are by definition unpaid (or not paid as a salaried employee), the statement is false.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: False. Option a is incorrect because it contradicts the meaning of "volunteer."

Raju watched the firefighters from the school _______.

Options:
a. window
b. yard
c. hall

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: বুঝতে হবে বাক্যে "from" নির্দেশ করছে কোথা থেকে রাজু ফায়ারফাইটারদের দেখছিল—অর্থাৎ অবস্থানের কথা।  
Step 2: বিকল্পগুলো পরীক্ষা করলে "window" এবং "hall" ভেতরের স্থান নির্দেশ করে, "roof" ছাদ, আর "yard" স্কুলের খোলা মাঠ বা উঠান যা বাইরে লোক দাঁড়িয়ে দেখার জন্য স্বাভাবিক।  
Step 3: তাই সর্বোত্তম এবং প্রাকৃতিক মিল হয় "yard" — "from the school yard" মানে রাজু স্কুলের উঠান থেকে ফায়ারফাইটারদের দেখছিল।  
অন্য বিকল্পগুলো অপ্রাসঙ্গিক কারণ তারা ভিতরের বা বিশেষ অবস্থান (ছাদ) বোঝায়, যা এখানে সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত নয়।

This shows he enjoyed helping others, so he did not mind the work. Other options (e.g., he wanted money, fame, or was forced) are unlikely because being a volunteer implies no pay, the text emphasizes his willingness rather than coercion, and there is no mention of seeking recognition.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence fragment "Raju was in Class 5 during the _______ at his school" and look for the word that best fits the context.  
Step 2: Consider each option’s natural collocation with "at his school": a) "earthquake" and d) "flood" are large-scale events affecting whole areas (less commonly phrased as happening specifically "at his school"), b) "storm" usually affects outdoor conditions, while c) "fire" is a common incident described as happening "at a school."  
Step 3: Choose the option that most naturally completes the sentence. The best fit is "fire" because we commonly say "a fire at the school" and it explains why Raju’s class situation (being in Class 5) is relevant.  

Therefore the correct answer is (c) fire.

Step 1: Look for explicit wording or evidence in the text that describes Raju’s attitude toward teaching — words like “enjoys,” “loves,” “takes pleasure in,” or descriptions of him being enthusiastic.

Therefore the correct answer is (b) He enjoys it.

Why the others are wrong:  
- (a) “He dislikes it” and (c) “He finds it boring” contradict the positive language in the passage.

Question:
The teachers made sure that the students left the building ________.

Options:
a. quickly
b. carelessly
c. quietly
d. loudly


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the context — "made sure that" implies the teachers ensured the manner in which students left the building.  
Step 2: Compare options: "quickly" (speed), "carelessly" (irresponsible manner), "quietly" (low noise), "loudly" (high noise). Teachers typically ensure orderly, low-noise departures to avoid disturbance or panic, so "quietly" best fits the meaning.  
Why others are wrong: "carelessly" contradicts "made sure" (they would prevent carelessness), "loudly" is the opposite of what teachers would want, and "quickly" focuses on speed rather than the likely intended manner. Therefore the correct answer is c: quietly.

Step 2: Compare the options: “part-time” means fewer hours, “temporary” means short-term, and “seasonal” means only during certain seasons; none of these match the idea of a regular employment start.  
Step 3: “Full-time” fits both grammatically and semantically, so the correct choice is (b) full-time.
