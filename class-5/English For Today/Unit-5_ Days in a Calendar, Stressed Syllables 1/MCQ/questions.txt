Question:
Given that there are 12 months in a year, how often do the months repeat in a calendar year?

Options:
a. Every month appears once.
b. Every month appears twice.
c. Every month appears three times.
d. Every month appears four times.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
A calendar year contains 12 months and each month name appears once in that year. Mathematically, the frequency is [math]12 \div 12 = 1[/math], so each month appears once. Therefore option (a) is correct; options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they claim months appear multiple times within the same year.

Question:
Considering the structure of a week and a month, what is the primary difference in terms of the number of days?

Options:
a. A week has more days than a month.
b. A month has more days than a week.
c. They both have the same number of days.
d. A week has fewer days than a month.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: A week has [math]7[/math] days.  
Step 2: A month has typically between [math]28[/math] and [math]31[/math] days (February has [math]28[/math] or [math]29[/math], others [math]30[/math] or [math]31[/math]).  
Step 3: Compare the numbers: for example [math]7 < 28[/math], so a month contains more days than a week. Therefore the correct answer is b.  

Brief note on other options: a and c are incorrect because a week does not have more or the same number of days as a month; option d states the same fact as b (that a week has fewer days), so it is equivalent in meaning, but the given correct choice is b.

Question:
How does the stress in English syllables relate to the rhythm in a month’s calendar?

Options:
a. Both create a predictable pattern.
b. Both are completely random.
c. One is fixed, the other is flexible.
d. Neither has any rhythm.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the nature of each phenomenon. Word stress in English often follows recurring patterns of strong and weak syllables (e.g., [math](strong, weak, strong, weak,\dots)[/math]), and a month’s calendar is organized into repeating 7‑day weeks, producing a regular temporal pattern ([math]7\text{-day cycles}\][/math]).

Step 2: Compare the patterns. Both involve predictability and repetition: stress patterns make pronunciations rhythmically regular, and the weekly layout makes dates fall into a repeated rhythmic structure.

Conclusion: Hence the best choice is (a) — both create a predictable pattern.

Briefly why the other options are wrong:
- (b) is false because neither stress patterns nor calendar weeks are completely random.  
- (c) is incorrect because both systems are patterned rather than one being fixed and the other flexible in the intended sense.  
- (d) is wrong because both clearly exhibit rhythm and regularity.

Question:
If the first month of the year is January, what month follows May according to the yearly calendar?

Options:
a. April
b. June
c. March
d. July


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Number the months starting with January as month [math]1[/math]. May is the 5th month, so the month after May is month [math]5 + 1 = 6[/math], which is June. Therefore the correct answer is option b: June.

Explanation of other options:
- April is month [math]4[/math], which comes before May.
- March is month [math]3[/math], earlier in the year.
- July is month [math]7[/math], which comes two months after May.

Question:
In a typical Gregorian calendar, which day of the week is considered the first?

Options:
a. Monday
b. Wednesday
c. Sunday
d. Saturday


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: In common printed and household Gregorian calendars (especially in the United States and many other countries) a week is displayed starting with Sunday in the leftmost column.  
Step 2: By this common convention the first day of the week on a typical Gregorian calendar is Sunday.  
Therefore the correct choice is option c (Sunday).  
Brief note: Some standards (ISO 8601) designate Monday as the first day for business/technical purposes, but that is a standard choice, not the typical printed-calendar convention; Wednesday and Saturday are not used as first-day conventions.

Question:
What is the total number of days in a regular year compared to a leap year?

Options:
a. Leap year has 366 days, regular year has 365 days.
b. Both have 365 days.
c. Leap year has 365 days, regular year has 366 days.
d. Leap year has 364 days, regular year has 365 days.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: A regular (common) year has [math]365[/math] days because February has [math]28[/math] days in such a year.
Step 2: A leap year adds one extra day to February (making it [math]29[/math] days), so a leap year has [math]366[/math] days.
Step 3: Leap years normally occur every 4 years, with the century rule (not a leap year if divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400).
Therefore the correct choice is (a): leap year [math]=366[/math] days, regular year [math]=365[/math] days. 

Briefly why others are wrong:
- (b) is wrong because a leap year does not have [math]365[/math] days.
- (c) is reversed.
- (d) is wrong because neither year has [math]364[/math] days.

Question:
When referring to the number of weekends in a month, what is a common calculation based on the days of the week?

Options:
a. There are typically 2 weekends in a month.
b. There are typically 3 weekends in a month.
c. There are typically 4 weekends in a month.
d. There are typically 5 weekends in a month.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: A weekend consists of two days (Saturday and Sunday), and a month has between 28 and 31 days.  
Step 2: Number of weeks ≈ days ÷ 7, so [math]28/7=4[/math], [math]30/7\approx4.29[/math], [math]31/7\approx4.43[/math].  
Step 3: Therefore a month contains at least four full weeks (i.e., four weekends); months with 30 or 31 days can sometimes include a fifth weekend depending on which weekday the month starts on.  
Conclusion: option c is correct. Options a and b are too small (ignore extra days beyond 21), and d can occur but is not the typical case.

Question:
What is the relationship between the number of days in a week and the concept of a calendar month?

Options:
a. A week defines a month.
b. A month is made up of weeks.
c. Weeks can exist without months.
d. Months dictate the number of weeks.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
A week is a fixed unit of [math]7[/math] days, i.e. [math]1\ \text{week}=7\ \text{days}[/math]. A calendar month has typically [math]28\text{–}31[/math] days, so a month contains about [math]28÷7=4[/math] to [math]31÷7≈4.43[/math] weeks on average — hence a month is made up of several weeks, so option (b) is correct. 

Why the others are wrong: option (a) is false because a week (7 days) does not by itself define the length of a month; option (c) is misleading because weeks are calendar units but months are composed of weeks rather than weeks existing independently of the monthly calendar; option (d) is incorrect because months vary in length and do not fix an exact whole number of weeks.

Question:
In a calendar, which month typically has 31 days?

Options:
a. February
b. April
c. June
d. October


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the usual number of days in these months: February has [math]28[/math] days (or [math]29[/math] in a leap year), April has [math]30[/math], June has [math]30[/math], and October has [math]31[/math].
Step 2: The month with [math]31[/math] days among the options is October, so the correct answer is option d.
Explanation of incorrect options: February is shorter ([math]28/29[/math]), and both April and June have [math]30[/math] days, not [math]31[/math].

Which statement correctly identifies the total number of days in a week?

Options:
a. There are 5 days.
b. There are 6 days.
c. There are 7 days.
d. There are 8 days.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: A standard week contains the days Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday — that is seven distinct days.  
Step 2: Counting them gives [math]1+1+1+1+1+1+1=7[/math], so the total number of days in a week is [math]7[/math].  
Explanation: Therefore option (c) is correct; options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they list counts (5, 6, 8) that do not match the seven named days.

What is the significance of knowing the order of the months in relation to planning activities throughout the year?

Options:
a. It helps in managing time effectively.
b. It is irrelevant for planning.
c. It only matters for holidays.
d. It has no impact on activities.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Knowing the order of the months provides a clear timeline for deadlines, milestones, seasonal changes and recurring events, so you can sequence tasks and allocate time appropriately — this directly supports effective time management.  
Step 2: From that reasoning, the best choice is option a because it describes the practical benefit of month-order knowledge for planning.  
Step 3: Options b and d are incorrect because month order is not irrelevant and does affect scheduling; option c is too narrow since months matter for far more than just holidays.

Why is it essential to learn the days of the week when discussing the calendar?

Options:
a. Days of the week help in understanding time management.
b. It is not essential.
c. Days don’t relate to the calendar.
d. Only months are significant.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the purpose — a calendar organizes dates and events; knowing the days of the week tells you on which weekday a given date falls.  
Step 2: Apply the reasoning — days of the week are needed to plan appointments, schedules, and weekly routines, so learning them is essential for using a calendar effectively.  
Conclusion: Option (a) is correct because it directly links days to time management and scheduling. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect: (b) and (c) deny the clear relationship between days and the calendar, and (d) wrongly claims months alone are sufficient for planning.

Question:
If a month starts on a Sunday, what is the day of the week for the last day of that month if it has 30 days?

Options:
a. Sunday
b. Monday
c. Tuesday
d. Wednesday


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The last day is [math]30[/math]th day, so the number of days after the first (Sunday) is [math]30 - 1 = 29[/math].  
Step 2: Days of week repeat every [math]7[/math] days, so find the remainder: [math]29 \bmod 7 = 1[/math]. That means the last day is one weekday ahead of Sunday.  
Step 3: One day after Sunday is Monday, so the last day is Monday. Hence option b is correct.  
Other options are incorrect because they correspond to offsets of [math]0,2,3[/math] days respectively, not the required offset [math]1[/math].

Question:
In relation to the yearly calendar, what is the total number of months that have 30 days?

Options:
a. 4 months
b. 5 months
c. 6 months
d. 7 months


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The months with 30 days are April, June, September, and November — that is 4 months.  
Step 2 (alternate check): There are 12 months total; 7 months have 31 days and February is 1 month with 28/29 days, so [math]12 - 7 - 1 = 4[/math].  
Therefore the correct answer is option a (4 months). Options b, c, and d are incorrect because they give counts larger than the actual four months with 30 days.

How do the concepts of rhythm in English language components connect with the rhythm of the calendar year?

Options:
a. Both involve structured repetition.
b. They are unrelated.
c. Only one has rhythm.
d. Rhythm is not a factor in either.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the rhythms — in language, rhythm means recurring patterns of stress, syllable timing, or meter that give speech or poetry a regular beat.  
Step 2: Identify the calendar rhythm — the calendar has regular, repeating cycles (days, weeks, months, seasons) that create predictable temporal patterns.  
Step 3: Connect the two — both are examples of structured repetition and predictable cycles, so they share the concept of rhythm. Therefore the correct choice is a.

Explanation why others are incorrect:
- b is wrong because the two clearly share the pattern-of-repetition property.  
- c is wrong because both (not only one) exhibit rhythm.  
- d is wrong because rhythm is indeed a factor in each.

What is the primary function of weekends in the context of a weekly calendar?

Options:
a. To provide time for work.
b. To offer time for leisure and rest.
c. To create longer weeks.
d. To mix weekdays with weekends.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the common purpose of weekends — they are the days at the end of a weekly cycle set aside from the regular workdays.  
Step 2: Reason that this separation exists to give people time for rest, recreation, family, and recovery from work-related duties, so the primary function is leisure and rest.  
Step 3: Conclude that option b is correct. Options a, c, and d are incorrect because weekends are not primarily for work (a), they do not change the length of a week (c), and they are meant to be distinct from weekdays rather than mixed with them (d).

Question:
Given that there are 12 months in a year and various days of the week are distributed across these months, how would you identify the frequency of Sundays in a month with 30 days?

Options:
a. 4 Sundays
b. 5 Sundays
c. 6 Sundays
d. 3 Sundays


Correct Answer: 4 Sundays

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Divide 30 days into full weeks and leftover days: [math]30 = 4 \times 7 + 2[/math].  
Step 2: Every weekday (including Sunday) appears at least [math]4[/math] times from the [math]4[/math] full weeks. The remaining [math]2[/math] days can add at most one extra Sunday, so a 30-day month has either [math]4[/math] or [math]5[/math] Sundays.  
Step 3: Since the question asks for the guaranteed frequency, the number of Sundays is [math]4[/math].

Why other options are incorrect:
- (b) 5 Sundays: possible for some 30-day months but not guaranteed.  
- (c) 6 Sundays: impossible because that would require at least [math]6 \times 7 = 42[/math] days.  
- (d) 3 Sundays: impossible because every weekday occurs at least [math]4[/math] times in 30 days.

Question:
Which of the following is a reason why leap years exist?

Options:
a. To increase summer
b. To keep our calendar in line with the seasons
c. To have more holidays
d. To confuse people


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The Earth takes about [math]365.2422[/math] days to orbit the Sun, but our calendar year is [math]365[/math] days, leaving a fractional difference of about [math]0.2422[/math] days per year.
Step 2: That fractional part accumulates, and after about four years it totals nearly one day: [math]0.2422 \times 4 \approx 0.9688 \approx 1[/math], so we add an extra day (a leap day) to keep the calendar aligned with the seasons.
Step 3: Therefore the purpose of leap years is to keep our calendar in line with the seasons, so the correct choice is option b.
Why the others are wrong: option a (to increase summer), option c (to have more holidays), and option d (to confuse people) are not the reasons—leap years are a technical correction for the fractional orbital period, not for longer summers, extra holidays, or confusion.

1. Identify what information you need: an up-to-date forecast for Saturday (rain probability, temperature, wind).  
2. Consult reliable, real-time sources such as weather apps, meteorological websites, or live weather broadcasts — these provide current forecasts and updates.  
3. Use that forecast to decide whether the picnic is feasible or needs rescheduling.

Reasoning: Listening to weather updates (option c) gives timely, expert forecasts and alerts, so it best answers the question. Options a (ask a friend) is informal and likely unreliable, b (look at the calendar) only shows the date not the weather, and d (wait and see) is risky because it leaves you unprepared. Hence the correct answer is c.

Question #29 (ID: 114208)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
In a typical calendar year, how do the number of days in a month influence the weekly distribution of days, such as the frequency of specific weekdays across different months?

Options:
a. Months with 30 days always have 4 of each weekday.
b. Months with 31 days can start on any weekday, affecting the number of each weekday.
c. February always has fewer weekdays than other months regardless of leap years.
d. All months have an equal number of weekdays regardless of their total days.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — basic idea: the number of times each weekday appears in a month depends on how many days beyond whole weeks the month has; compute days mod 7.  
Step 2 — compute remainders: [math]30 = 4\times7 + 2[/math], so a 30-day month has two weekdays that occur 5 times and five weekdays that occur 4 times. [math]31 = 4\times7 + 3[/math], so a 31-day month has three weekdays that occur 5 times and four weekdays that occur 4 times; which weekdays are the extra ones depends on the weekday the month starts. [math]28 = 4\times7[/math] so a common February has exactly four of each weekday, while [math]29 = 4\times7 + 1[/math] (leap year) gives one weekday 5 times.  
Conclusion: option b is correct because 31-day months can start on any weekday and that starting weekday determines which three weekdays occur 5 times.  
Why the others are wrong: a is false because 30-day months do not have 4 of each weekday (they have two weekdays 5 times). c is false because February in a common year has equal counts (four each) and in a leap year has one extra weekday. d is false because different month lengths produce different distributions.

b. To schedule events
c. To play games
d. To cook food


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নের মূল উদ্দেশ্য বুঝুন — ক্যালেন্ডারের প্রধান কাজ হলো তারিখ ও সময় অনুযায়ী ঘটনা, সভা বা কাজ নির্ধারণ করা।

Question:
Why do we have different months in a year?

Options:
a. To count time accurately
b. To confuse people
c. To make calendars colorful
d. To make days longer


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the purpose of dividing the year. A year is the time Earth takes to orbit the Sun, about [math]365\text{ days}[/math], so we divide that interval into smaller, regular parts to measure and organize time.

Step 2: Explain why months help. Months provide convenient chunks of time (historically linked to lunar cycles) so people can plan, record events, and count time accurately; on average a month is about [math]\dfrac{365}{12}\approx 30.4\text{ days}[/math].

Step 3: Conclude and eliminate other choices. Therefore the correct answer is (a) — to count time accurately. Options (b) and (c) are not true purposes (calendars aren’t designed to confuse or merely to be colorful) and (d) is false because months do not change the length of days.

Count forward three days starting from Monday. Step by step: [math]\text{Monday} \to \text{Tuesday} \;(+1) \to \text{Wednesday} \;(+2) \to \text{Thursday} \;(+3).[/math] Therefore three days from Monday is Thursday.

Explanation of other options:
- [math]\text{Tuesday}[/math] is one day later, not three.

Question:
A leap year has 365 days.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
A leap year has one extra day added to February (29 days instead of 28), so the total number of days is [math]365 + 1 = 366[/math]. In the Gregorian calendar, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years (e.g., [math]2000[/math] is a leap year, [math]1900[/math] is not).

Question:
When does a leap year occur?

Options:


Correct Answer: Every four years

Solution:
A leap year is added to keep the calendar aligned with the solar year. Earth's orbital period is about [math]365.2422[/math] days, so each year has roughly an extra [math]0.2422 \approx \tfrac{1}{4}[/math] day; after four years these fractional days sum to about one full day ([math]4 \times 0.2422 \approx 0.9688 \approx 1[/math]), so we add one extra day (February 29). Therefore a leap year occurs every four years. (In the Gregorian rule there is a correction: years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400.)
