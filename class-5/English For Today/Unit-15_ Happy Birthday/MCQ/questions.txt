What common element do the celebrations of birthdays across different cultures share, despite variations in customs?

Options:
a. The presence of gifts.
b. The use of birthday cakes and candles.
c. Singing songs.
d. The gathering of friends and family.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the stem — we want the element that appears across many cultures "despite variations in customs," so pick the most widely shared symbolic practice.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: gifts (a) and singing (c) occur often but are not universally present; gathering friends and family (d) is common but can be absent in solitary or constrained situations. Birthday cakes with candles (b) have become a widespread, recognizable ritual symbolizing another year and are commonly used across diverse cultures.  
Therefore the best answer is (b).

Options:
a. The significance of friends and family.
b. The importance of enjoying personal achievements.
c. The use of food as a central element.
d. The necessity for cultural traditions.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main emphasis in Chapter 1622 — the celebrations are centered on gatherings and emotional support from close people.  
Step 2: Identify Maria’s experience in Chapter 1627 — her events highlight relationships, comfort, and presence of friends/family.  
Step 3: Compare themes — both passages share the importance of personal relationships, so the correct answer is (a) the significance of friends and family.  

Why other options are incorrect: (b) focuses on individual achievement, which isn’t the shared emphasis; (c) treating food as central is not highlighted in both chapters; (d) cultural traditions are not presented as the necessary common theme.

Question:
How does the celebration of birthdays differ between countries, particularly concerning gifts and parties?

Options:
a. All countries require gifts to be brought for birthday celebrations.
b. Some countries have parties for children's birthdays while others do not emphasize gifts.
c. Most countries celebrate birthdays with the same types of food and games.
d. Every culture sings the same birthday song and expects gifts.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Birthday customs vary by culture: many places have parties for children and gift-giving, but others celebrate more quietly or focus on family time without expecting presents. Option (b) correctly captures this variation — some countries have parties for children's birthdays while others do not emphasize gifts. Options (a) and (d) are incorrect because they claim universal requirements (gifts or the same song) which don’t hold globally, and (c) is wrong because foods and games differ widely between cultures.

Options:
a. All cultures celebrate birthdays with gifts and parties.
b. Some cultures do not include gifts in their celebrations.
c. Only children's birthdays are celebrated with parties.
d. Everyone celebrates birthdays the same way worldwide.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the options and identify the general claim — some answers assert that birthday customs are universal (a, d) or apply only to children (c), while (b) allows cultural variation.  
Step 2: Use reasoning and real-world knowledge: birthday customs differ by culture — some emphasize parties and gifts, others mark the day with family rituals, religious observances, or no gift-giving at all.  
Step 3: Conclude that (b) is correct because it accurately reflects that some cultures do not include gifts. Options (a) and (d) are incorrect because they wrongly claim uniform worldwide practices, and (c) is incorrect because many cultures celebrate adult birthdays as well.

Question:
What is the common practice regarding candles on a birthday cake, and how is it culturally significant?

Options:
a. Candles are only for decoration and have no significance.
b. Each candle represents one year of the person's life, symbolizing growth.
c. There is only one candle for everyone, regardless of age.
d. Candles are only used during children's birthday celebrations.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the common practice — people put candles on a birthday cake with the number of candles typically equal to the person's age.  
Step 2: Interpret the cultural meaning — each candle symbolizes one year of life and marks growth, the passage of time, and is tied to customs like making a wish and blowing out the candles.  
Step 3: Choose the correct option — this matches option b.  

Briefly why the others are wrong: option a is incorrect because candles are not purely decorative; option c is wrong because there are usually as many candles as years, not a single universal candle; option d is false because candles are used for both children’s and adults’ birthdays.

Which statement reflects a common misunderstanding about birthday celebrations worldwide?

Options:
a. Birthday celebrations involve cake and songs in all cultures.
b. The most important aspect of birthdays is the presence of gifts.
c. People always blow out candles together as a family.
d. Celebrations can vary greatly between cultures, affecting how birthdays are observed.


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read each option and identify whether it makes an absolute/universal claim or acknowledges cultural variation.  
Step 2: Options a, b, and c make universal generalizations ("in all cultures", "always", "most important"), which are common misunderstandings because birthday customs differ widely across societies.  
Step 3: Option d correctly states that celebrations can vary greatly between cultures, so it addresses (and thus reflects recognition of) the common misunderstanding that birthdays are the same everywhere. Therefore the correct answer is d.

Question:
In the context of a birthday celebration, how does the importance of gifts compare to spending time with family and friends?

Options:
a. Gifts are outweighingly more important than time spent with loved ones.
b. Spending time with family and friends is often prioritized over gifts.
c. Gifts are necessary for a successful celebration.
d. Celebrations do not require any form of gathering.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the question — compare the relative importance of material gifts versus interpersonal time during a birthday celebration.  
Step 2: Reasoning — birthdays typically mark personal relationships and shared moments; spending time with family and friends provides emotional connection, memories, and support that gifts alone cannot replace.  
Step 3: Conclusion — option b is correct because people commonly prioritize being together over receiving presents. Options a and c are incorrect because they overstate the necessity or superiority of gifts, and option d is incorrect because celebrations usually involve some form of gathering or shared activity.

Options:
a. It emphasizes cultural heritage rather than personal milestones.
b. Both days are celebrated with cakes and candles.
c. International Mother Language Day is only important in Bangladesh.
d. Birthdays are more historically significant than International Mother Language Day.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the focus of each celebration — birthdays mark individual life milestones, while International Mother Language Day highlights preservation and promotion of languages and cultural heritage.  
Step 2: Compare significance — International Mother Language Day emphasizes collective cultural identity and linguistic rights rather than personal events.  
Conclusion: Therefore option a is correct. Options b, c, and d are incorrect because b wrongly equates celebration style, c wrongly limits the day to one country, and d wrongly claims birthdays have greater historical significance than a day commemorating linguistic and cultural rights.

Question:
How does the expression of joy during a birthday party contrast with the solemnity of International Mother Language Day?

Options:
a. Birthdays are celebrated with happiness, while International Mother Language Day is a day of mourning.
b. Both days are celebrated equally with songs and gatherings.
c. International Mother Language Day is focused on joy, unlike birthdays.
d. Birthdays involve competition, while International Mother Language Day does not.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the typical tone of each event — birthdays are usually joyful celebrations (parties, songs, cake), whereas International Mother Language Day commemorates the language-martyrs and is observed solemnly.  
Step 2: Compare this contrast to the options: option a states that birthdays are celebrated with happiness while International Mother Language Day is a day of mourning, which matches the observed difference.  
Therefore the correct answer is a.  

Why the others are incorrect: b is wrong because the two are not celebrated in the same joyful way; c is wrong because International Mother Language Day is not focused on joy; d is irrelevant because birthdays are not defined by competition.

Question:
What is one key difference in how the date of a birthday is formatted compared to significant national days like Independence Day?

Options:
a. Birthdays are often written with the year first.
b. Significant days usually mention the day of the week.
c. Birthdays typically emphasize the month and day rather than the year.
d. Both types of dates use the same formatting conventions.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the typical emphasis for each type of date — personal birthdays are used to mark age and anniversaries, so people usually refer to the month and day (e.g., "July 14") while the year is secondary.  
Step 2: Significant national days (like Independence Day) are celebrated annually, so they are commonly cited by month and day as well, but the distinguishing point in the question is how birthdays often focus on the month/day for recurring celebration rather than recording the year.  
Step 3: Compare the options: option c correctly states that birthdays typically emphasize the month and day rather than the year.

Why other options are incorrect:
- Option a is wrong because birthdays are rarely written with the year first in normal usage.  
- Option b is incorrect because significant days do not usually require mentioning the day of the week.  
- Option d is false because there is a practical difference in emphasis (birthday year is often less important).  

Therefore the correct answer is c.

How might the celebration of a child's birthday be more festive than that of adults according to cultural practices?

Options:
a. Children's birthdays have less emphasis on food and games.
b. Parents often host larger parties for children than for adults.
c. Adult birthdays are celebrated with more gifts than children's.
d. Children's birthdays are not celebrated with friends.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret "more festive" as larger parties, more decorations, games and guests typical in cultural practice.
Step 2: Compare choices: option (b) says parents often host larger parties for children than for adults, which directly matches that interpretation.
Step 3: Conclude that (b) is correct because children's birthdays commonly involve bigger gatherings, special activities and family effort to make them festive.
Why the others are wrong: (a) is false because children's parties usually emphasize food and games; (c) is incorrect since adults do not generally receive more gifts than children; (d) is false because children's birthdays are often celebrated with friends.

d. Singing does not play any significant role in either event.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপে ধাপে বিশ্লেষণ:
1. প্রথমে ঘটনাগুলোর উদ্দেশ্য দেখা প্রয়োজন—জন্মদিন সাধারণত ব্যক্তিগত আনন্দ উদযাপন, তাই সেখানে উৎসবমূলক গান (যেমন "শুভ জন্মদিন") গাওয়া হয়।  
2. অন্যদিকে আন্তর্জাতিক মাতৃভাষা দিবস বা স্মরণীয় অনুষ্ঠানগুলোতে গান থাকে কিন্তু তা বেশি করে স্মৃতিচারণ, সংগ্রামী ইতিহাস ও জাতীয়ত্ত্বের প্রতিফলন করে (উদাহরণ হিসেবে দেশাত্মবোধক বা স্মরণার্থক গান)।  
3. এই দুটি উদাহরণ মিলিতভাবে দেখায় যে উভয় ক্ষেত্রেই গান ব্যবহৃত হয়, কিন্তু থিম ও উদ্দেশ্য ভিন্ন। ফলে সঠিক উত্তর হলো b।  

কেন অন্যান্য অপশনগুলো ভুল:
- a এবং c ভুল কারণ গান কোনো একটিতে সীমাবদ্ধ নয়—উভয় ক্ষেত্রেই গান থাকে।  
- d ভুল কারণ গান উভয় অনুষ্ঠানে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ভূমিকা রাখে।

Question:
How is the act of blowing out candles on a birthday cake generally perceived in contrast to the observance of International Mother Language Day?

Options:
a. Both acts are equally celebratory.
b. Blowing out candles symbolizes personal wishes, unlike the solemnity of International Mother Language Day.
c. Only International Mother Language Day involves blowing out candles.
d. Blowing out candles is only done during group gatherings.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the nature of each act — blowing out birthday candles is a personal, celebratory ritual associated with making wishes and marking an individual's birthday.  
Step 2: Recognize that International Mother Language Day is a solemn, public observance honoring language rights and commemorating sacrifices, not a personal wish-making celebration.  
Therefore the best match is option b: blowing out candles symbolizes personal wishes, unlike the solemnity of International Mother Language Day.  
Other options are incorrect because a is wrong (they are not equally celebratory), c is false (International Mother Language Day does not typically involve blowing candles), and d is false (blowing candles can occur privately or in groups, not only during group gatherings).

Question:
Why might some cultures choose not to give gifts during birthday celebrations, in comparison to the expectations during events like International Workers’ Day?

Options:
a. Gifts are considered unnecessary for personal celebrations.
b. Workers’ Day emphasizes gifts to appreciate contributions.
c. Cultural values regarding materialism affect gift-giving traditions.
d. Only children receive gifts during birthdays.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Step 1: সেন্ট্রাল আইডেন্টিফিকেশন — প্রশ্নটি cultural norms (সংস্কৃতিক মূল্যবোধ) বনাম institutional/collective expectations-এর মধ্যে পার্থক্য জানতে চাইছে।  
Step 2: অপশনগুলো যাচাই — a খুব সারসংক্ষেপ ও সর্বজনীন দাবি করে (সব ব্যক্তিগত উদযাপনে উপহার অসম্প্রয়োজনীয়) — এটি অতিরঞ্জিত; b ভুল কারণ International Workers’ Day সাধারণত উপহারকেন্দ্রিক নয় বরং শ্রমিকের অবদান ও ঐক্যের উদযাপনে কেন্দ্রিত; d ভুল কারণ উপহার শুধুমাত্র শিশুদের জন্য সীমাবদ্ধ নয়।  
Step 3: সিদ্ধান্ত — c সঠিক: বিভিন্ন সংস্কৃতিতে ভোগবাদ বা বস্তুগত মূল্যবোধ সম্পর্কে ভিন্ন দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি থাকে, ফলে জন্মদিনে উপহার না দেওয়ার রীতিনীতি থাকতে পারে, যা Workers’ Day-এর সামরিক বা সামাজিক স্বীকৃতি-ভিত্তিক প্রত্যাশার সাথে আলাদা।

What is a common characteristic of birthday cakes across many cultures, and how does this compare to traditional foods served during national observances?

Options:
a. Both birthday cakes and national foods are typically sweet.
b. Birthday cakes are always savory, unlike national foods.
c. National observances often feature a variety of foods, while birthday cakes focus on one item.
d. Both occasions have cakes as a central element.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Birthday cakes across many cultures share the common characteristic of being a single celebratory dessert item (typically sweet) centered on the cake itself. National observances, by contrast, often feature a variety of traditional dishes and multiple foods rather than one single item. Therefore the best choice is option c because it correctly contrasts the focused nature of birthday cakes with the variety served at national events. Options a, b, and d are incorrect: a is wrong because national observance foods are not typically all sweet; b is false because birthday cakes are generally sweet, not savory; d is incorrect because cakes are not a central element of many national observances.

Question:
In what way do the rituals associated with birthdays demonstrate personal significance differently from the collective significance of days like International Workers’ Day?

Options:
a. Birthdays focus on individual milestones, while national days celebrate collective achievements.
b. Both emphasize personal and collective importance equally.
c. Only birthdays have rituals involving singing.
d. Workers’ Day is solely about individual contributions.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the focus of each type of ritual — birthdays mark an individual's life milestone and are organized around that person (cake, candles, personal gifts), whereas International Workers’ Day highlights collective labor history, solidarity, and group achievements (marches, rallies, public ceremonies).
Step 2: Compare how significance is expressed — birthday rituals center the individual’s experience; national days express shared values and accomplishments of a group.
Conclusion: Option a is correct because it captures this individual-versus-collective distinction. Options b, c, and d are incorrect: b is wrong because the emphasis is not equal; c is wrong because singing is not unique to birthdays; d is wrong because Workers’ Day centers collective rather than solely individual contributions.

b. Children's birthdays are often marked by games and entertainment.
c. Both types of celebrations are the same.
d. Only children's birthdays involve family gatherings.


Correct Answer: খ

Step 1: প্রশ্ন থেকে লক্ষ্য করুন—শিশুর জন্মদিন সাধারণত খেলাধুলা, থিমভিত্তিক মজা ও মনোরঞ্জন (যেমন গান, খেলা, পিনিয়াটা) দিয়ে সাজানো থাকে যা বেশিরভাগ অংশগ্রহণকারীকে একসাথে জড়ো করে।  
Step 2: প্রাপ্তবয়স্কদের জন্মদিন সাধারণত কম খেলাধুলা বা বিনোদনমূলক ক্রিয়াকলাপ নিয়ে ছোট পরিবেশে বা খাবারের মাধ্যমে উদযাপিত হয়।  
Step 3: তাই সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত উত্তর হল b — “Children's birthdays are often marked by games and entertainment.” 

অপর বিকল্পগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: a ভুল, কারণ প্রাপ্তবয়স্কদের উদযাপন সাধারণত কম গণউদ্যোগপূর্ণ; c ভুল, কারণ উভয়ের ধরন সাধারণত আলাদা; d ভুল, কারণ পারিবারিক সমাবেশ দুই ধরনের ক্ষেত্রেই হতে পারে।

ধাপ ১: জন্মদিনে রঙিন কাগজে উপহার মুড়িয়ে দেওয়ার সাংস্কৃতিক মানে হলো ব্যক্তিগত সুখ, উত্সব ও আনন্দ উদযাপন করা—রঙিন মোড়ক উদযাপনের আবেগ ও খুশির প্রতীক।  
ধাপ ২: আন্তর্জাতিক মাতৃভাষা দিবসের মতো স্মরণীয় জাতীয়/সাংস্কৃতিক দিনে প্রধান ফোকাস ঐতিহ্য, ভাষা ও শ্রদ্ধা; সেখানে সাধারণত উপহারবস্ত্রের রঙিন মোড়ক দেখা যায় না বা সেটাই প্রধান প্রচলন নয়।

How does the practice of having a birthday party compare to the tradition of celebrating significant historical events like Independence Day?

Options:
a. Birthday parties are typically more formal than Independence Day celebrations.
b. Independence Day celebrations often have more structured rituals than birthday parties.
c. Both celebrations are informal and focus on food and gatherings.
d. Birthday parties do not include any food.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the typical nature of each celebration — a birthday party is usually a personal, informal event centered on socializing, cake and gifts, while Independence Day is a national observance with formal elements.  
Step 2: Note the presence of structured rituals — Independence Day commonly includes flag hoisting, official ceremonies, parades and speeches, which are more formal and ritualized than most birthday parties.  
Step 3: Conclusion — therefore option b is correct: Independence Day celebrations often have more structured rituals than birthday parties.  
Why the other options are incorrect: a is wrong because birthdays are generally less formal; c is wrong because Independence Day often involves formal, symbolic rituals beyond casual food and gatherings; d is false because birthday parties commonly include food.

Question:
What relationship exists between the act of counting candles on a birthday cake and the significance of specific historical dates like International Workers’ Day?

Options:
a. Counting candles is a way to signify personal growth, unlike the historical focus of national days.
b. Both practices emphasize numerical significance.
c. Counting candles is exclusive to national observances.
d. Only International Workers’ Day involves counting as a ritual.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the nature of each practice — counting candles on a birthday chiefly marks an individual's age and personal growth, while commemorating dates like International Workers’ Day marks collective historical events, struggles, or political meanings.  
Step 2: Compare their purposes — one is personal and symbolic of individual passage of time; the other is public and symbolic of shared history or social cause.  
Therefore option a is correct: counting candles signifies personal growth, unlike the historical focus of national days.

Why the other options are wrong:
- b is incorrect because the primary emphasis in national days is historical or political significance, not numerical value.  
- c is incorrect because counting candles is not exclusive to national observances — it’s a private birthday ritual.  
- d is incorrect because International Workers’ Day is not centered on a ritual of counting; it commemorates labor history and solidarity.

Question:
What can the absence of gift-giving in some birthday celebrations indicate about cultural attitudes towards material possessions compared to views on communal holidays?

Options:
a. Gifts are always expected in communal holidays.
b. Material possessions are seen as less important in some cultures.
c. Birthdays always involve gifts, regardless of culture.
d. The attitude towards gifts is the same across all cultural contexts.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the pattern — some cultures celebrate birthdays without exchanging gifts, while communal holidays often involve shared rituals and sometimes gift-giving.  
Step 2: Interpret the cultural meaning — omitting gifts for personal celebrations suggests that material possessions are not the primary focus; emphasis is more on relationships, ritual, or community.  
Step 3: Match to options — this interpretation corresponds to option b: "Material possessions are seen as less important in some cultures."

Why the others are incorrect:
- a is too absolute: communal holidays are not always expected to include gifts.  
- c is false because birthdays do not universally involve gifts.  
- d is incorrect because attitudes toward gifts vary across cultural contexts.

Solution:

Step 1: Identify typical birthday activities — people usually celebrate, have cake, give/receive gifts, and share moments that are social in nature.  
Step 2: Compare the choices: "Spending time with friends and family" matches common birthday behaviors (parties, gatherings, shared meals), whereas alternatives like "working" or "being alone" do not fit the usual celebratory pattern.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: A "birthday" is the specific calendar day on which a person was born (the anniversary of their birth).  
Step 2: Compare the options: option b ("The day a person is born") matches this definition, so it is correct.  
Why the others are wrong: option a ("One month after birth") and option c ("Every month") describe different timings, not the actual birth date; option d ("Only on weekends") is arbitrary and unrelated to when someone was born.

In typical social situations children invite friends to birthday parties and those friends attend, so the statement that "Children's friends usually come to the birthday celebration" is true in general.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence: "In some cultures, the most important aspect is to __________ the day." We need a verb that naturally completes the idea of what those cultures value doing with the day.

Step 2: Evaluate options: a) "Make it perfect" is possible but implies perfectionism rather than a general cultural value; b) "Complicate" is negative and illogical; d) "Copy others" is unrelated. c) "Enjoy" naturally fits—many cultures emphasize enjoying or savoring the day.

ধাপ ২: উপলব্ধি করা—দিবসটি স্মৃতি শ্রদ্ধা, ফুলচড়ানো, এক মিনিট নীরবতা, ভাষণ ও সাংস্কৃতিক আলোচনা আয়োজনের মাধ্যমে পালিত হয় এবং শহীদ মিনারে মাল্যদান করা হয়।

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the options and recall common birthday traditions. Typical essential items associated with a birthday cake include something used for the celebration act (making a wish, blowing out).

Step 2: Identify which option matches that essential role. A candle (option b) is the customary, symbolic item placed on a birthday cake for the celebrant to blow out and make a wish, so it is the essential item for the birthday ritual.

Step 3: Explain why the others are not essential. Icing (option c), marzipan (a) and fruit (d) are decorative or flavor choices for a cake but are not required for the birthday tradition itself.

Options:

Step 2: Check evidence — different cultures have distinct birthday customs (for example, blowing candles and cakes in many Western countries, a piñata in Mexico, coming-of-age ceremonies in some Asian countries, or no celebration in others).  
Step 3: Conclude — since documented cultural differences exist, the statement is true.

Why the other option is incorrect: Option (b) "False" would mean every country celebrates birthdays the same way, which contradicts observable cultural variation. Therefore the correct answer is (a) True.

Options:

c. Friend
d. Wish


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the common tradition — people place one candle on a birthday cake for each year of the person's life.
Step 2: Therefore the number a single birthday candle represents is one year (so the correct option is b: Year). For example, if a child turns 7, the cake usually has 7 candles ([math]7 = 7\ \text{years (candles)}[/math]).
Explanation of other options: a (Moment) is incorrect because a candle marks a whole year, not just a brief moment; c (Friend) is unrelated; d (Wish) is what you make when blowing the candle, but the candle itself represents a year.

Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and identify what usually happens at a child's birthday — common elements are parties, cake, presents, and playful activities.  
Step 2: Compare the options: conflicts, mundane tasks, and work do not match the typical festive nature of a child’s birthday, while "games and fun" directly matches expected activities.  
Therefore the correct answer is option c: Games and fun.

Question:
What is the fundamental idea behind birthday celebrations?

Options:


Correct Answer: To celebrate the life of a person.

Solution:
সমাধান:  
ধাপ ১: জন্মদিন মূলত কোনো ব্যক্তির জন্মের বার্ষিকী হিসেবে তার জীবন, বেড়ে ওঠা এবং অস্তিত্বের গুরুত্ব স্মরণ ও উদযাপন করার জন্য পালন করা হয়।  
ধাপ ২: উপহার, পার্টি বা সামাজিক মিলন ইত্যাদি হচ্ছে জন্মদিন উদযাপনের উপায়; তবে এগুলো মৌলিক উদ্দেশ্য নয়, বরং জীবনের আনন্দ ও কৃতজ্ঞতা প্রকাশের মাধ্যম।  
অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হলো: একজন ব্যক্তির জীবন উদযাপন করা — অন্য বিকল্পগুলো (শুধু উপহার নেওয়া বা কেবল সামাজিক প্রদর্শনী) উপকরণ বা ফলস্বরূপ, কিন্তু মূল উদ্দেশ্য নয়।

Step 2: Home is the most common because it offers privacy, space for guests, food and decorations, and is easy to organize.
Step 3: Other options are less likely: workplaces may have small celebrations, schools sometimes for children, and libraries are unsuitable due to quiet rules. 
Therefore the correct answer is (b) Home.

Question:
Birthday parties only happen for children.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) বাক্যটির মানে: "Birthday parties only happen for children" অর্থাৎ কেবলমাত্র শিশুদের জন্যই জন্মদিনের পর্ব ঘটে — এটি একটি সার্বজনীন বিবৃতি যা বলছে কোনো প্রাপ্তবয়স্কের জন্য জন্মদিনের পার্টি হতে পারে না।  
2) কৌশল: একটি সার্বজনীন বক্তব্যকে ভুল প্রমাণ করার জন্য একটি বিরোধী উদাহরণ যথেষ্ট। বাস্তবে প্রাপ্তবয়স্করা, পরিবার ও বন্ধুদের দ্বারা পরিচালিত বড় জন্মদিনের পার্টি করে; সেলিব্রিটি বা প্রাপ্তবয়স্ক বন্ধুবিশেষের উদাহরণ রয়েছে।  
3) উপসংহার: যে statement–টি "কেবলমাত্র শিশুদের জন্য" বলে তা ভুল, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো b (False)। বিকল্প a (True) ভুল কারণ বাস্তবে বড়দেরও জন্মদিনের পার্টি হয়।

Question:
The birthday song is usually sung at the __________.

Options:
a. Dinner
b. Beginning of the party
c. Cake time
d. After the gifts


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Step 1: In a typical birthday sequence, the cake is brought out and candles are lit; at that moment people sing the birthday song so the celebrant can blow out the candles.  
Step 2: Therefore the birthday song is usually sung at cake time. Hence option c is correct.  
Step 3: Options a (Dinner) and b (Beginning of the party) are incorrect because the song is normally tied to the cake moment, not the meal or the very start; option d (After the gifts) is incorrect because gifts are often given after or around the cake, not before the song.

Question:
What should a person do after making a wish?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: After lighting the candles and making a silent wish, the next action is to blow out the candles. Step 1: Make the wish quietly and keep it to yourself. Step 2: Blow out the candles in one breath — this is the customary way to “send” or seal the wish. Other options (for example, singing, clapping, or announcing the wish) are incorrect because the tradition calls for extinguishing the candle flame immediately and keeping the wish secret.

What is often the first step in a birthday celebration?

Options:
a. Cutting the cake
b. Singing the birthday song
c. Blowing out the candles
d. Opening gifts


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Typically the first step is to gather everyone and sing the birthday song to focus attention and celebrate the person, so Step 1 is singing the song. Step 2: candles are lit while people sing; Step 3: the celebrant blows out the candles; Step 4: the cake is cut and then gifts are opened. Therefore the correct answer is b (Singing the birthday song). The other options (a, c, d) usually occur after the song and so are not the usual first step.

How do many cultures commonly celebrate birthdays?

Options:
a. With fireworks
b. With a cake
c. With parades
d. With singing


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify widely shared birthday customs — many cultures have a ritual involving a special food item that people gather around.  
Step 2: Reasoning — a decorated cake with candles and the cutting ceremony is a common, recognizable practice worldwide, so "With a cake" is the best choice.  
Brief note on other options: fireworks and parades (options a and c) are occasional or for large public celebrations, not typical for ordinary birthdays; singing (option d) often accompanies the cake ritual but by itself is less central than the cake.  
Correct answer: b (With a cake).

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: প্রচলিত অভ্যাস অনুযায়ী জন্মদিনের কেকের প্রতিটি মোমবাতি একজনের বয়সের একটি বছরকে নির্দেশ করে।  
Step 2: তাই কেকের মোমবাতির সংখ্যা সমান হবে ব্যক্তির বয়সের বছরের সংখ্যার সাথে, উদাহরণস্বরূপ [math]n = \text{age in years}[/math].  
Step 3: তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল c (Year)। বিকল্প a (Gift), b (Friend) এবং d (Party) ভুল, কারণ মোমবাতি গিফট, বন্ধু বা পার্টিকে নির্দেশ করে না—এগুলো জন্মদিনের বছরের প্রতিনিধিত্ব করে।

Options:

Solution:

Step 2: এই উদ্দেশ্যে সবচেয়ে প্রচলিত জিনিস হচ্ছে উপহার—ফেলে রাখার মত খেলনা, জামাকাপড় বা প্রয়োজনীয় জিনিসপত্র।  
Step 3: তাই প্রশ্নের সঠিক উত্তর হলো "Gifts" — কারণ কেক বা সজ্জা সাধারণত আয়োজনকারী বা পার্টির জন্য সবার দ্বারা ভাগাভাগি করা হয়, কিন্তু বন্ধুদের নির্দিষ্টভাবে আনার বিষয়টি হলো উপহার।

Question:
In every culture, friends are expected to bring gifts to birthday celebrations.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The statement asserts a universal rule ("in every culture"), so we test its universality by looking for counterexamples. Many cultures either do not celebrate birthdays in the same way (some mark age annually without gift-giving) or customs assign gift-giving to family, not friends, and in some societies birthdays are not celebrated at all. Since a single counterexample disproves a universal claim, the statement is false; therefore option b is correct and option a is incorrect because it overgeneralizes across all cultures.

Why is a birthday considered a special day?

Options:


Correct Answer: It marks the date when a person was born.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: A birthday is the calendar date on which a person was born — the anniversary of their birth.  
Step 2: Because it marks that original birth date, people treat it as a personal milestone to celebrate life, reflect on the past year, and recognize growth.  
Step 3: Things like gifts, parties, or traditions are reasons people celebrate on that day, but the fundamental reason it is “special” is that it marks the date when the person was born.

Step 1: Identify the claim — it states a universal fact that "Gifts are the most important aspect of a birthday celebration."  
Step 2: Reasoning — importance of a birthday element is subjective and varies by person and culture; other aspects like time with family and friends, cake, memories, or traditions can be equally or more important.  
Step 3: Conclusion — the statement is not universally true, so the correct answer is b (False). Option a is incorrect because it asserts a single most important aspect for all birthdays, which is not supported.

Solution:

Step 1: Read the sentence and identify the context — "birthday" normally refers to a social celebration where guests gather.  
Step 2: Check each option for suitability: a) "ceremony" implies a formal event (less common for children's birthdays), b) "party" is the common term for a birthday celebration where children play games, c) "meal" refers only to eating, and d) "transition" is unrelated.

Options:

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the statement — birthday candles traditionally mark how many full cycles of life a person has completed.

ধাপ ১: বাক্যটি "most" দ্বারা বোঝায় সংখ্যাগতভাবে বেশিরভাগ বা বেশিাংশ, অর্থাৎ [math]>50\%[/math] মানুষকে নির্দেশ করে।  
ধাপ ২: বাস্তবে বড় অংশই জন্মদিনে বড় করে পার্টি করে না—অনেকেই ছোটখাটো উদযাপন করে, কেউ কেউ উদযাপনই করে না (সংস্কৃতি, বয়স, আর্থ-সামাজিক পরিস্থিতি ইত্যাদি কারণে)। তাই দাবিতে থাকা "most adults" অর্থাৎ বেশিরভাগ প্রাপ্তবয়স্কদের জন্য এটি সত্য হওয়া নিশ্চিত করা যায় না।  
উপসংহার: সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে b (False)। বিকল্প a (True) ভুল, কারণ জন্মদিনে উত্তেজনাপূর্ণ পার্টি করা সবাই বা বেশিরভাগ প্রাপ্তবয়স্কের জন্য সার্বজনীন নয়।

Question:
In some cultures, friends and family blow out the __________ on a birthday cake.

Options:
a. candles
b. balloons
c. decorations
d. lights


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) প্রশ্নে বলা হয়েছে জন্মদিনের কেকে বন্ধুবান্ধব ও পরিবারের লোকেরা "ফুঁ দেয়" এমন কিছু খুঁজতে হবে; সাধারণ সাংস্কৃতিক প্রথা অনুযায়ী কেকে মোমবাতি রাখা হয় এবং তা ফুঁ দেওয়া হয়।  
2) অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হলো a — candles (মোমবাতি)।  
3) অন্য অপশনগুলি ভুল কারণ গুব্বারা (balloons), সজ্জা (decorations) বা বাতি/লাইট (lights) কেকের ওপর এমনভাবে রাখা থাকে না যাতে সবাই একসাথে ফুঁ দিয়ে নেয়; ঐগুলো সাধারণত কেকের বাইরে সাজানোর উপকরণ।

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রশ্নে জিজ্ঞাসা করা হয়েছে কী ধরনের উপহার জন্মদিনে দেওয়া হতে পারে। সাধারণভাবে জন্মদিনের উপহারগুলো ছোট থেকে মাঝারি মূল্যমানের ব্যক্তিগত উপহার—যেমন খেলনা, বই, গহনা বা পোশাক—হয়ে থাকে, তাই টয় (option b) এই বিবেচনায় সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো—একটি আসবাবপত্র, গাড়ি বা একটি বাড়ি—অতি ব্যয়বহুল এবং বিশেষ ক্ষেত্রে বা খুব কাছের সম্পর্ক ছাড়া সাধারণ জন্মদিনের উপহার হিসেবে দেওয়া হয় না, তাই সেগুলো ভুল। সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: b.

Question:
The children play __________ during birthday parties.

Options:
a. games
b. sports
c. music
d. movies


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and note the verb "play" — we need a noun that commonly follows "play" in the context of birthday parties.  
Step 2: Check options for natural collocations: "play games" is a common activity at birthday parties; "play sports" is less typical indoors, "play music" is possible but usually adults or a DJ do that, and we say "watch movies" rather than "play movies."  
Conclusion: The best choice is (a) games.

Question:
How are birthday gifts often presented?

Options:


Correct Answer: Wrapped in colorful paper

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Consider common birthday-gift customs — people usually want to create a surprise and make the gift look festive.  
Step 2: Wrapping in colorful paper both conceals the contents (preserving the surprise) and improves presentation, so it is the typical choice.  
Therefore the correct answer is "Wrapped in colorful paper." Briefly, other forms (gift bags, boxes, or unwrapped presents) exist but are less stereotypical than brightly wrapped gifts.

Question:
All friends bring gifts to birthday celebrations.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the statement as a universal claim — "every friend brings a gift to birthday celebrations."  
Step 2: To disprove a universal claim it suffices to give one counterexample.  
Step 3: A counterexample: at some birthday one or more friends may not bring a gift (because they are absent, forget, or choose not to), so the claim fails.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:

Step 1: Understand the sentence — a birthday marks the anniversary of a person's birth and is commonly used to mark how old they have become.  
Step 2: Compare options: "success" and "growth" are possible themes but not the direct thing a birthday marks; "friends" are people who may attend, not what is celebrated.  
Step 3: The most direct and literal fit is "their age," so the correct choice is (c).

The most important thing about birthdays is the gifts.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the statement is a value judgment (an opinion), not an objective fact.  
Step 2: Evaluate universality — while gifts can be important to some people, many others consider family, friendships, memories, or personal reflection as the main purpose of a birthday.  
Conclusion: Because the claim "the most important thing about birthdays is the gifts" is not universally true, the correct answer is b: False. Option a is incorrect because it treats a subjective preference as a universal fact.

Question:
When is Language Martyrs' Day celebrated?

Options:


Correct Answer: 21st of February

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the historical event — Language Martyrs' Day commemorates the students and activists killed on 21 February 1952 during protests in Dhaka for recognition of the Bengali language.  
Step 2: Connect the date to the commemoration — because the fatal shootings occurred on that specific day, the day is observed each year on 21st February.  
Step 3: Note wider recognition — UNESCO also declared 21 February as International Mother Language Day, confirming 21st February as the correct date.  

Therefore, Language Martyrs' Day is celebrated on 21st of February.

Correct Answer: খ

Question:
Celebrating birthdays varies from one culture to another.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
1. Interpret the statement: it asserts that birthday celebrations differ across cultures.  
2. Reasoning: different societies have varied traditions, rites of passage, foods, ages celebrated, and religious or social rules (for example, some cultures emphasize coming-of-age ceremonies, others mark birthdays with family meals or do not celebrate at all).  
3. Conclusion: because observable evidence from anthropology and everyday life shows these differences, the statement is true.  
4. Why the other option is incorrect: option (b) "False" would claim birthdays are celebrated identically everywhere, which contradicts the documented cultural variation. Therefore the correct answer is (a) True.
