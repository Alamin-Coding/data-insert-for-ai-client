Now, I'm writing about it.I went on a picnic at Sonargaon with my friends. It is a place of historical interest. We started the journey at 8 am by a bus. It took us an hour to reach Sonargaon. It's a very beautiful place. There are many trees. There are also ruins of old buildings. However, we cooked our lunch there. After having it we wandered around for sight-seeing. In the afternoon we visited the folk museum there. At 6 pm we started our return journey. We enjoyed the picnic a lot.What's new with you? How are things at school?Please write.Your loving friendNaima
