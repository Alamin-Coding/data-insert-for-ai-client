Question:
On 14 December, our class went on a field trip to the Liberation War Museum at Agargaon, Dhaka. The trip was planned as part of our Bangladesh and Global Studies course. Our bus reached the museum at 10 a.m. A guide was waiting for us. He welcomed us warmly and took us on a quick tour of the different galleries and exhibits of the museum. At first we watched a video clip on our Liberation war and our independence.

There were four permanent galleries that exhibited rare photographs, documents and newspaper clippings and objects used by the freedom fighters and the martyrs of our liberation war. As we went inside "Gallery 4- Our Victory, Our Values", we fell silent. We were sad as we looked at the personal belongings of some of our martyred intellectuals.
