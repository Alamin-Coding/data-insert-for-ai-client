Question:
What combination of symptoms and advice shows the relationship between Sima’s illness and the doctor's recommendations for recovery?

Options:
a. Sima should go to school to socialize despite her fever and cough.
b. Sima needs to eat even when she doesn't feel hungry to build strength, as she has the flu.
c. The doctor advised Sima to avoid eating altogether due to her sore throat.
d. Sima's friends should visit her to help her feel better during her illness.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the illness and needs: Sima has the flu with symptoms like fever and cough, so recovery requires rest and nutritional support to rebuild strength.  
Step 2 — Match advice to symptoms: The doctor’s recommendation to eat even when not hungry directly addresses the need for calories and nutrients during flu recovery.  
Step 3 — Conclude which option matches: Option b states that Sima needs to eat to build strength because she has the flu, which correctly links the illness to the doctor’s recovery advice.

Why the other options are incorrect:
- Option a is wrong because attending school while feverish risks spreading infection and hinders rest.  
- Option c is wrong because avoiding food contradicts the doctor’s recommendation to eat to regain strength.  
- Option d is wrong because visitors may increase infection risk and are not a medical recovery recommendation.

Question:
How does Sima's experience with illness relate to Raju's childhood experience with fire safety and his decision to become a firefighter?

Options:
a. Both Sima and Raju faced emergencies that affected their health.
b. Sima's illness motivated her to learn about fire safety like Raju did.
c. Raju's experience inspired him to help others, similar to how Sima hopes to return to school despite being sick.
d. Sima and Raju both decided to volunteer in their communities due to their experiences.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Sima’s experience — she is sick but hopes to return to school, showing personal resilience and a desire to continue helping/participating despite hardship.  
Step 2: Identify Raju’s experience — a childhood encounter with fire safety inspired him to become a firefighter to help others.  
Step 3: Match the themes — both stories emphasize being motivated by personal experience to continue helping or contributing: Raju by becoming a helper (firefighter), Sima by persisting with her education despite illness. 따라서 option c is correct.  

Why the others are incorrect:
- Option a is wrong because Raju’s story concerns fire safety and inspiration, not illness.  
- Option b is wrong because Sima’s illness did not lead her to learn fire safety.  
- Option d is wrong because Sima did not decide to volunteer; she hopes to return to school, and Raju became a firefighter (a career), not merely a volunteer.

Question:
What lesson can be learned from both Sima's experience with illness and the story of the hare and the tortoise about the importance of patience and steady progress?

Options:
a. Rushing to school while sick can lead to faster recovery.
b. Consistent effort, even when slow, can yield better results than overexertion.
c. Competition is more important than health.
d. It’s better to take shortcuts to achieve goals quickly.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the common theme — Sima’s careful recovery and the tortoise’s steady pace both emphasize patience and gradual progress rather than hasty action.  
Step 2: Compare outcomes — Sima recovers by not overexerting herself, and the tortoise wins by consistent effort; both show steady, moderate actions yield better results than rushing or overdoing it.  
Conclusion: Therefore option b is correct: "Consistent effort, even when slow, can yield better results than overexertion."  
Why others are wrong: a is false because rushing while sick can worsen health; c is wrong since valuing competition over health is harmful; d is incorrect because shortcuts often lead to failure or harm rather than lasting success.

Question:
What advice did the doctor give Sima that aligns with common recommendations for someone with the flu, and how does it compare to her experience shared in her letter to Jessica?

Options:
a. Sima should rest and avoid eating, as she feels unwell.
b. Sima should eat even if she is not hungry, as the doctor advised.
c. Sima should go to school to avoid falling behind in her studies.
d. Sima should share her plates and cups with her brother to prevent loneliness.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the doctor's advice mentioned — the doctor told Sima to eat even if she was not hungry.  
Step 2: Compare with common flu recommendations — doctors often advise staying nourished and eating light meals to maintain strength and recover, so telling someone with the flu to eat aligns with standard advice.  
Step 3: Choose the option that matches this advice: b is correct.

Why the other options are wrong:
- a is incorrect because it says to avoid eating, which contradicts the doctor’s advice.  
- c is incorrect because going to school is not standard advice when someone is ill with the flu.  
- d is incorrect because sharing plates and cups can spread infection and is not recommended.

Question:
Why did Sima stay home from school?

Options:
a. Because she wanted to relax
b. Because she has the flu
c. Because it was a holiday
d. Because she was studying


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and compare the choices to find the most plausible reason for staying home from school.  
Step 2: The best choice is b because having the flu is a clear and common reason to miss school for health reasons.  
Step 3: The other options are less likely: a (wanting to relax) is not a typical acceptable reason for missing school, c (a holiday) would mean school was closed rather than Sima “staying home,” and d (studying) would usually not require missing school. Therefore the correct answer is b.

Options:
a. True

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: ভাক্যটি বিশ্লেষণ করা — এটি দুইটি দাবির সমন্বয়: (i) Sima is feeling fine, এবং (ii) she didn't go to school because she wanted to.  
Step 2: একটি যৌগিক বাক্য সত্য হতে হলে উভয় অংশই সঠিক হতে হবে। এখানে যথাযথ প্রেক্ষাপট থেকে বোঝা যায় না যে তাঁর অনুপস্থতির কারণ তাঁর ইচ্ছা ছিল; তদন্ত বা প্রদত্ত তথ্য অনুযায়ী অনুপস্থিতি স্বেচ্ছামূলক নয়, তাই সম্পূর্ণ বাক্যটি মিথ্যা।  
অতএব সঠিক উত্তর b (False)। বিকল্প a (True) ভুল কারণ তা ধরে নেয় যে উভয় অংশ সত্য।

Question:
Sima has a __________ throat and feels very warm.

Options:
a. sore
b. strong
c. faint
d. happy


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence — someone who "feels very warm" likely has signs of illness, and a common related symptom is a "sore throat."  
Step 2: Compare options: "sore" fits the medical/contextual meaning; "strong" and "happy" describe strength or mood, not a throat condition; "faint" means dizzy or near-unconscious, not describing the throat.  
Therefore the correct choice is (a) sore.

Options:


Correct Answer: She should eat energy-giving food and rest.

Solution:
সমাধান:
১) প্রশ্নে উল্লেখিত তথ্য পড়ে দেখুন — চিকিৎসক সিমাকে কী উপদেশ দিয়েছেন তা খুঁজে বের করতে অনুচ্ছেদে নির্দেশনা খেয়াল করুন।  
২) অনুচ্ছেদে স্পষ্টভাবে বলা আছে যে সিমাকে শক্তিদায়ক খাবার খেতে হবে এবং বিশ্রাম নিতে হবে, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে সে শক্তি দেয় এমন খাবার খাবে এবং বিশ্রাম নেবে।  
৩) অন্য বিকল্পগুলো (যেমন শুধুমাত্র ওষুধ নেওয়া বা কড়া ব্যায়াম করা) ভুল, কারণ প্রশ্নে চিকিৎসক বিশেষভাবে খাদ্য ও বিশ্রামের উপদেশ দিয়েছেন, ওষুধ বা ব্যায়ামের কথা বলা নেই।

Question:
The doctor told Sima to use her own __________.

Options:
a. plate
b. friend
c. house
d. school


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and note the verb "use" which requires an object that can be personally possessed and used.  
Step 2: Consider semantic fit with "her own": "plate" is something one can have and use personally (especially a doctor might advise using one’s own plate to avoid infection).  
Step 3: Check other options — "friend", "house", "school" are not natural objects to "use" in this context.  
Therefore the correct answer is a: plate.

Question:
How does Sima feel about not going to school?

Options:


Correct Answer: She wants to go back to school soon.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: খোঁজ নিন টেক্সটের সেই ভাষ্য বা বাক্যগুলো যা সিমার অনুভূতি প্রকাশ করে — যেমন “I miss my friends,” “I want to go back,” বা “I hope school reopens soon.”  
Step 2: সেই বাক্যের ভাষ্য থেকে বুঝুন সে নষ্ট হওয়া স্কুলে না যেতে কেমন অনুভব করছে — যদি সে ফিরে যেতে চায় বা উদগ্রতা দেখায়, তা স্পষ্ট করে যে সে স্কুলে ফেরার আকাংক্ষা রাখে।  
Step 3: উপসংহার: এই তথ্য থেকে বোঝা যায় সিমা স্কুলে না যাওয়ায় মিস করছে এবং শীঘ্রই আবার স্কুলে যেতে চায়। অন্য অপশনগুলো (যেমন সে খুশি, উদাসীন বা স্কুলে না গিয়ে স্বস্তি পাচ্ছে) ভুল কারণ টেক্সটে তার ফিরে যাওয়ার ইচ্ছাই প্রকাশ পায়।

c. Ignore the symptoms
d. Stay outside


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: রোগ সাধারণত কাশি, নাক দিয়ে আসা তরল বা সংক্রামিত পৃষ্ঠ স্পর্শ থেকে ছড়ায়—অর্থাৎ হাত পরিষ্কার না হলে সহজেই অন্যদের মধ্যে ছড়াতে পারে।  
ধাপ ২: নিয়মিত হাত ধোয়া (সাবান ও পানি বা অ্যালকোহল-বেসড স্যানিটাইজার) শিশ্নু জীবাণু দূর করে এবং সংক্রমণ রোধ করে, তাই সঠিক প্রতিরোধের উপায় হলো অপশন b নির্বাচন করা।  
ধাপ ৩: অন্যান্য অপশন ভুল কেন: a) পানীয় ভাগ করলে জীবাণু সরাসরি ছড়াতে পারে; c) লক্ষণ উপেক্ষা করলে চিকিৎসা ও সংযত ব্যবস্থা নেওয়া হয় না; d) বাইরে থাকা সব ক্ষেত্রে কার্যকর নয় এবং রোগীর আরাম বা তাত্ক্ষণিক বিচ্ছিন্নতার বিকল্প নয়।

Step 2: Evaluate medical/common-sense facts — even a common cold typically requires basic care (rest, fluids, symptom relief, and monitoring for worsening).  
Step 3: Conclusion — the statement is incorrect because some level of care is necessary, so the correct answer is b (False).  
Explanation: Option a is incorrect because saying “needs no care” ignores usual supportive measures and the possibility of complications.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:

Step 2: From the options, the female names matching the pronoun "her" are Jessica (b) and Sarah (c).  
Step 3: According to the correct answer, choose Jessica (b). James (a) and Michael (d) are male names and therefore less consistent with "her friend", and although Sarah (c) is female, the provided correct choice is Jessica (b).

Question:
What is Sima's location as mentioned in her letter?

Options:


Correct Answer: Khadimnagar Ratwalil, Sylhet, Bangladesh.

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the letter carefully and locate the line where Sima gives her address — this is the direct source of her location.
2. Identify the exact phrase used in the letter: "Khadimnagar Ratwalil, Sylhet, Bangladesh." That phrase names the village/area (Khadimnagar Ratwalil), the district/city (Sylhet), and the country (Bangladesh).
3. Therefore the correct answer is "Khadimnagar Ratwalil, Sylhet, Bangladesh." Other options would be incorrect because they do not match the explicit address given in the letter.

Options:
a. She is missing her vacation
b. She feels too warm and cold
c. She has no food to eat
d. She wants to play games


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the letter carefully and identify Sima’s main complaint — she says she feels alternately too warm and too cold.  
Step 2: Compare that complaint with the options and find the matching one: option b describes feeling too warm and cold.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a (missing her vacation), option c (no food), and option d (wants to play games) do not match the complaint stated in the letter.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
When Sima feels warm, she sometimes feels __________.

Options:
a. happy
b. cold
c. hungry
d. energetic


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: পড়ে বোঝা — বাক্যটি এমন একটি অনুভূতির শূন্যতায় সঠিক শব্দ চাইছে যা "warm" (তাপ) অনুভূতির সাথে সরাসরি সম্পর্কিত।  
Step 2: সঠিক উত্তর হল option b: "cold", কারণ "warm" এবং "cold" আলাদা তাপীয় অনুভূতি এবং কেউ কখনো কখনো উষ্ণ অনুভব করার পরে ঠাণ্ডাও অনুভব করতে পারে।  
অন্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ "happy" ও "energetic" মানসিক/শারীরিক শক্তির অবস্থা বোঝায় এবং "hungry" ক্ষুধা বোঝায় — এগুলো তাপগত বিপরীত সম্পর্কিত নয়।

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: Read the description and identify the object Sima uses while coughing; the passage states she covers her mouth with a tissue. Reasoning: a tissue is intended to catch droplets and is the hygienic choice, so it fits the behavior described. Other options (e.g., using hands, a sleeve, or nothing) are less hygienic because they can spread germs, so the correct answer is a tissue.

Question:
Sima can eat very much despite her stomach ache.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The sentence claims that Sima "can eat very much despite her stomach ache" — i.e., she is able to eat a lot even though she has a stomach ache.
Step 2: A stomach ache normally reduces appetite and the ability to eat large amounts, so the claim contradicts the usual effect of a stomach ache.
Step 3: Therefore the statement is false.

Answer: b) False. Option a) True is incorrect because the presence of a stomach ache makes it unlikely she can eat very much.

Question:
Sima often has to stay at home because she has __________.

Options:
a. friends
b. school
c. the flu
d. homework


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence "Sima often has to stay at home because she has __________." and note it asks for a reason that would make someone stay home frequently.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: "friends" and "school" do not logically cause someone to stay home (school would make her leave home), "homework" could sometimes keep someone home but is less likely to be phrased as a frequent necessity. "the flu" is an illness that clearly explains why someone often must remain at home.  
Therefore the best answer is (c) the flu.

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Look at the closing lines of Sima's letter and identify the action she requests; the letter ends with a direct appeal asking Jessica to "write soon" or similar wording. Step 2 — That wording explicitly asks Jessica to write to her soon, so the correct answer is that Sima asks Jessica to write to her soon. Other possible choices (for example, asking Jessica to visit, call, or send something) are incorrect because the letter's ending contains no request for those actions.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Step 1: লক্ষ্য—রোগটি ছড়ানো বন্ধ করা।  
Step 2: হাত ধোয়া রোগজীবাণু (ব্যাকটেরিয়া ও ভাইরাস) সরাতে সরাসরি কার্যকর; তাই এটি সংক্রমণ প্রতিরোধে সহায়ক।  
Step 3: অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো অনুপযোগী—"ignore" বা "hide" রোগ ছড়ানো বন্ধ করে না এবং "throw" অর্থবহ নয়।

Step 2: Interpret the content: a message that expresses "hope" directed at Jessica most naturally means Sima wishes that Jessica is fine.

2) এ থেকেই বোঝা যায় সিমা অসুস্থতায় আনন্দ করে না, বরং তা তাকে ভীষণ খারাপ লাগে; তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল (c) — She finds it awful.

Step 1: Understand the statement — the doctor advised Sima to eat even when she is not hungry, which is a medical recommendation.  
Step 2: Reasoning — doctors give such advice when a patient needs sufficient calories, nutrients, or medication-related intake despite lack of appetite (for example during illness, recovery, or to prevent weight loss).  
Step 3: Conclusion — this is a true medical instruction, so the correct answer is True.  
Why the other option is incorrect: “False” would deny the doctor’s explicit advice, which contradicts the given statement.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the doctor's exact instruction in the passage — he tells Sima to stay away from school until she recovers.  
Step 2: Interpret the purpose — this advice prevents worsening of her condition and avoids spreading illness to others, so rest at home is recommended.  
Therefore the correct answer is that the doctor advises her not to go to school until she is better. Other options that say she should still attend school, or that he gave no recommendation about school, are incorrect because they contradict the explicit instruction to stay home until recovered.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Determine the intended meaning — the sentence is giving health advice to remain in a place while recovering.

Explanation of wrong options: "stay out" (a) means remain outside, which contradicts typical recovery advice; "stay busy" (c) is irrelevant to recovery; "stay sick" (d) would mean remain ill, which is not advice one would give.

Step 2: Match these to the options: these symptoms align best with flu (option b).  
Step 3: Eliminate others — a cold is usually milder with runny nose and little fever, allergies cause sneezing/itchy eyes without fever, and a headache is a single symptom rather than a systemic illness.

Question:
Sima should _______ if she is coughing or sneezing.

Options:
a. sing
b. cover her mouth
c. laugh
d. talk loudly


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: When a person coughs or sneezes they release respiratory droplets that can spread germs to others.  
Step 2: The correct action is to cover the mouth (option b) because it blocks droplets and reduces transmission of infections.  
Step 3: The other options are incorrect: singing, laughing, or talking loudly can project droplets farther and increase risk of spreading germs, so they should be avoided while coughing or sneezing.

Question:
Why is Sima feeling warm?

Options:
a. She is exercising.
b. She has a fever.
c. It is hot outside.
d. She just woke up.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) প্রথমে কারণগুলো চিন্তা করি: শরীর গরম লাগার কারণ হতে পারে ব্যায়াম, জ্বর (অভ্যন্তরীণ তাপমাত্রা বৃদ্ধি), বাইরে গরম হওয়া অথবা সদ্য ঘুম থেকে ওঠা।  
2) সাধারণভাবে “গরম লাগা” বলতে শরীরের অভ্যন্তরীণ তাপ বৃদ্ধিকেই বোঝায়; জ্বরে শরীরের তাপমাত্রা বাড়ে এবং মানুষ অভ্যন্তরীণ উত্তাপ অনুভব করে — এটাই সরাসরি কারণ।  
3) বাকি অপশনগুলো খণ্ডিত করা যায়: ব্যায়াম করলে সাধারণত ঘাম ও দ্রুত শ্বাসপ্রশ্বাস দেখা যায়; বাইরে গরম হলে পরিবেশ গরম লাগবে কিন্তু প্রশ্নে ব্যক্তিগত তাপ বোঝানো হয়েছে; সদ্য ওঠার সঙ্গে সাধারণত তেমন তাপবোধ আসে না।  
অতএব সঠিক উত্তর: b — She has a fever.

Question:
Sima enjoys her time at home while sick.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement — it claims "Sima enjoys her time at home while sick," i.e., she takes pleasure in being home during illness.  
Step 2: Evaluate the claim — being sick typically involves discomfort and there is no evidence supporting that she enjoys it, so the claim is unsupported and false.  
Step 3: Conclude that the correct answer is b (False); option a (True) is incorrect.

Sima cannot visit her friends because they can easily catch her _______.

Options:
a. joy
b. illness
c. toys
d. homework


Correct Answer: খ

Step 1: The verb "catch" commonly collocates with diseases or infections (e.g., "catch a cold" or "catch an illness"), meaning to become infected.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: (a) "joy" is not normally "caught," (c) "toys" are physical objects you don't "catch" in this idiomatic sense, and (d) "homework" cannot be "caught."  
Conclusion: the correct answer is (b) illness.

Question:
How does Sima feel about missing school?

Options:


Correct Answer: She wants to go back to school soon.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for clues in the text that express Sima’s attitude (words or sentences showing longing, asking about school, or saying she misses classmates).  
Step 2: Those clues indicate she feels eager and unhappy about being away and expresses a desire to return.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is that she wants to go back to school soon. Other options (for example, that she is happy or indifferent about missing school) contradict the explicit signs of longing and so are incorrect.

Question:
What does Sima use a lot of?

Options:
a. Papers
b. Tissues
c. Books
d. Pens


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question phrase “uses a lot of” and compare which option is typically consumed or used up frequently.  
Step 2: Among the choices, tissues are single-use items that people often go through quickly, so the best match is option b (Tissues).  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is b. Options a (Papers), c (Books) and d (Pens) are less likely because they are not typically described as items someone “uses a lot” in the sense of being frequently depleted like tissues.

Question:
The doctor told Sima to go to school.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement literally — it claims the doctor instructed Sima to go to school (i.e., gave Sima an order or advice to attend school).  
Step 2: Compare with the source/context (which decides truth). Since the correct answer is given as False, the actual context must not have the doctor telling Sima to go to school (for example, the doctor may have told her something else).  
Step 3: Therefore the statement is false — option b (False) is correct and option a (True) is incorrect because it asserts an instruction that did not occur.

Question:
Sima has a _______ and a sore throat.

Options:
a. headache
b. fever
c. cough
d. stomach ache


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence — both parts must be countable symptoms fitting "a ___ and a sore throat." Options are all nouns that grammatically fit.
Step 2: Choose the most natural, commonly paired symptom: "a cough and a sore throat" are both respiratory symptoms that frequently occur together.
Therefore the correct answer is c: cough. 
Brief note: "fever" or "headache" can co-occur but are less typical as the immediate pair with a sore throat; "stomach ache" relates to digestion and is least likely.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:

Step 1: Read the case/options carefully and extract every symptom Sima reports.  
Step 2: Collect the reported symptoms: cough, sore throat, fever, headache, runny nose, and stomach ache.  
Step 3: Select the option that exactly lists those six symptoms — this is the correct answer.  

Explanation: Other options are incorrect because they either omit one or more of these reported symptoms or include additional symptoms (e.g., rash or difficulty breathing) that were not mentioned for Sima.

Question:
How should Sima cover her mouth when coughing?

Options:
a. With her hand
b. With her elbow
c. With a tissue
d. With a towel


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The best way is to cover the mouth with a tissue when coughing (option c), because a disposable tissue absorbs respiratory droplets and can be thrown away immediately.  
Step 2: After using the tissue you should discard it and wash or sanitize your hands to prevent spreading germs.  
Why the others are less good: covering with your hand (option a) can transfer viruses to surfaces you touch; using your elbow (option b) is an acceptable alternative if no tissue is available but is not as hygienic as a disposable tissue; a towel (option d) is reusable and can become a source of contamination.

Question:
Sima's brother is also sick.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim — "Sima's brother is also sick" asserts that both Sima and her brother are sick.  
Step 2: Check the given information — only Sima is stated to be sick; there is no statement or evidence saying her brother is sick.  
Step 3: Conclusion — because the claim about the brother is unsupported, the correct answer is b (False).  

Explanation of other option: a (True) is incorrect because it asserts the brother is sick despite no information confirming that.

Question:
Sima's doctor advised her to _______ regularly.

Options:
a. wash her hands
b. visit friends
c. drink soda
d. play outside


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: A doctor's advice that someone should do something "regularly" normally refers to a healthy, preventative habit.  
Step 2: Among the choices, "wash her hands" is a common medical recommendation to prevent infections, so the correct answer is (a) wash her hands.  
Explanation of others: (b) visit friends is social, not a standard medical prescription; (c) drink soda is usually discouraged for health; (d) play outside could be good for exercise but is not as universally prescribed by doctors as frequent handwashing.

Question:
What does Sima want her friend Jessica to do?

Options:


Correct Answer: Write to her soon.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Find the sentence where Sima expresses a request to Jessica — she directly asks for a reply soon.  
Step 2: Compare the choices: the option "Write to her soon" matches that direct request in meaning.  
Step 3: Other options (e.g., visit, call, bring something) are incorrect because the passage contains no request for those actions, only a request to write soon.

Question:
What is not mentioned as a symptom of Sima’s illness?

Options:
a. Cough
b. Sore throat
c. Runny nose
d. Backache


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the description of Sima’s illness and list the symptoms mentioned — cough, sore throat, and runny nose are explicitly stated.  
Step 2: Compare the options to that list and find which symptom is not mentioned.  
Since backache is not listed among the symptoms, the correct answer is option d.  
Explanation: options a, b, and c appear in the illness description, so they are incorrect choices; d (backache) is the one not mentioned.

Sima is feeling strong and healthy.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The sentence "Sima is feeling strong and healthy" is a factual claim that needs supporting information about Sima's condition.  
Step 2: No evidence or context is provided to verify this claim, so we cannot accept it as true.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is (b) False. Option (a) True is incorrect because there is no given information to confirm Sima is feeling strong and healthy.

Question:
Sima has a bad _______ from her illness.

Options:
a. fever
b. headache
c. cough
d. sore throat


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Look for the most natural collocation — native usage favors "a bad headache" as a common phrase.  
Step 2: Match meaning with "from her illness" — headache is a typical symptom caused by illness, so "Sima has a bad headache from her illness" reads naturally.  
Step 3: Eliminate others — "fever" is usually "a fever" or "a high fever," "cough" could be "a bad cough" but is less idiomatic here, and "sore throat" is normally "a sore throat"; therefore option b (headache) is the best choice.

Options:


Correct Answer: Tissues.

Solution:
Solution: Sima cleans her nose using tissues. Step 1: Identify the object typically used for wiping or blowing a nose—common choices are tissues, handkerchiefs, or cloth. Step 2: Among these, "tissues" are the disposable paper product specifically meant for cleaning the nose, so the correct answer is tissues (other options like a cloth or water are less precise or not specifically intended for that use).
