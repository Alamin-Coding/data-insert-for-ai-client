Question:
Sima is at home today. She didn't go to school today because she is ill. She has a cough and a sore throat. She also feels very warm because she has a fever. She has the flu. The doctor visited Sima last night. She needs some medicine. He also told her what to do in order to get well soon. The doctor's advice: Eat food that gives your body energy. Try to eat, even if you aren't hungry. You need to be strong. Rest! Stay at home. Don't go to school or work. Drink a lot of water or juice. They are better than soft drinks. Are you coughing or sneezing? Cover your mouth and nose! Use a tissue, not your hand! Wash your hands regularly. Use your own plate, glass and cup. Other people can catch your illness from these things.
