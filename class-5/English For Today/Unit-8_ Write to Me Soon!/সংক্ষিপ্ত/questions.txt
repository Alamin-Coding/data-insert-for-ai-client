Question:
What advice did the doctor give Sima to help her recover from the flu?

Options:


Correct Answer: Eat food that gives your body energy and rest.

Solution:


Explanation:
The doctor advised eating energy-giving food and resting because the body needs calories and nutrients to power the immune response and repair tissues. Rest reduces energy use and stress on the body, allowing the immune system to work more effectively and helping symptoms improve faster.

Question:
What are the consequences of Sima not following her doctor's advice regarding her health?

Options:


Correct Answer: She may take longer to recover from her illness and risk spreading it to others.

Solution:


Explanation:
Because a doctor's instructions (medication, rest, wound care, isolation, etc.) are meant to help the body heal and prevent complications, ignoring them can slow recovery and prolong symptoms. If the illness is contagious, failing to follow precautions (like staying home or hygiene measures) also raises the risk of spreading the infection to others.

Both the doctor’s advice and Nasreen’s and Sima’s food choices focus on eating fruits and vegetables to gain energy and stay healthy. Nutritious foods provide vitamins, minerals and slow-release energy, so their preferences match the doctor’s recommendation.

Question:
What healthy eating habits does Sima suggest to Nasreen, and how does this relate to Sima's experience with illness in Chapter 1615?

Options:


Correct Answer: Sima suggests eating fruits and vegetables regularly, which is important for recovery from illness as indicated by the doctor's advice to Sima.

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: Sima advises Nasreen to eat fruits and vegetables regularly because they provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber that help the body recover and stay healthy. This relates to Chapter 1615 where Sima’s own illness and the doctor’s advice emphasize good nutrition as important for recovery, so her recommendation comes from her personal experience and medical guidance.

Question:
What important health advice does Sima's doctor provide her regarding her illness and nutrition?

Options:


Correct Answer: The doctor advises Sima to eat energy-giving food even if she isn't hungry and emphasizes the importance of rest.

Solution:


Explanation:
The doctor’s advice is correct because when someone is ill the body needs extra energy and nutrients to fight infection and repair tissue, so eating energy-giving food even without appetite prevents weakness and speeds recovery. Rest is emphasized because sleep and reduced activity allow the body to direct energy toward healing and support immune function. Together proper nutrition and rest help the patient regain strength more quickly.

Question:
How does Sima's experience with illness compare to the tortoise's steady approach in the race against the hare?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Identify the key features of Sima’s experience with illness and the tortoise’s approach in the fable.
- Compare those features to extract the common principle and any useful contrasts.
- State the conclusion about what both examples teach.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Describe Sima’s experience:
   - Sima’s recovery from illness likely involved gradual improvement, following treatment, rest, and steady self-care. This implies patience, adherence to a plan, and persistence despite slow progress or setbacks.

2. Describe the tortoise’s approach:
   - In the race against the hare, the tortoise proceeds slowly but consistently, maintaining a steady pace until reaching the goal. The tortoise’s method emphasizes consistency and perseverance over speed or bursts of effort.

3. Compare and map the features:
   - Both situations value sustained, regular effort rather than quick, erratic attempts. Sima’s steady recovery (daily medicines, rest, incremental gains) parallels the tortoise’s one-step-at-a-time progress.
   - Both show resilience: continuing despite slow progress or obstacles (illness symptoms for Sima; the hare’s early lead and possible distractions for the tortoise).
   - Both contrast with impatience or overreliance on short-term speed (e.g., reckless rushing that causes relapse or the hare’s complacency).

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Persistence: continuing actions over time toward recovery or a goal.
- Consistency and pacing: regular, manageable effort often leads to sustainable success.
- Long-term focus: prioritizing steady progress rather than immediate results.
- Resilience to setbacks: maintaining effort despite slow improvement or interruptions.

Conclusion:
- Both Sima and the tortoise demonstrate the importance of persistence and steady effort. Whether recovering from illness or finishing a race, consistent, patient action often succeeds where haste or inconsistency fails.

Example (brief, only if helpful):
- If Sima takes prescribed medication daily and slowly regains strength, this is analogous to the tortoise taking steady steps to finish the race—both succeed through regular, disciplined effort.

Explanation:
Both Sima and the tortoise show persistence: Sima keeps working through illness to recover, and the tortoise keeps moving steadily despite being slow. The underlying idea is that consistent, determined effort can overcome obstacles and lead to success.

Question:
What should Sima do to avoid spreading her illness to others as per the doctor's advice and her own experience in her letter?

Options:


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Answer approach:
Identify how respiratory illnesses spread (droplets and contact) and choose simple actions that block those routes: catching droplets at source and preventing transfer via shared utensils.

Step-by-step solution and reasoning:
1. Cover mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
   - Why: Coughs and sneezes emit respiratory droplets that carry pathogens. A tissue catches most droplets at the source, reducing how many land on surfaces or reach other people.
   - How: Hold the tissue over mouth and nose, dispose of it immediately in a closed bin, and then clean hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer.

2. Use her own plates and cups (do not share).
   - Why: Saliva and small droplets can contaminate cups or utensils. Sharing them transfers infectious material directly to others.
   - How: Use separate crockery for the duration of illness, wash used items thoroughly with hot water and detergent before others handle them, or use disposable items if appropriate.

Relevant principles:
- Source control: Stopping infectious droplets at the source (covering coughs/sneezes) is one of the most effective ways to protect others.
- Breaking transmission pathways: Avoiding shared utensils prevents indirect contact transmission via contaminated objects (fomites).

Brief example (illustrative):
If Sima sneezes into a tissue and throws it away, the droplets stay contained; if she also drinks from her own cup instead of sharing, she prevents saliva-based transfer to family members.

Conclusion:
Therefore, Sima should cover her mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and use her own plates and cups to avoid spreading her illness.

Explanation:
Covering her mouth and nose with a tissue stops respiratory droplets (which carry germs) from reaching other people, and disposing the tissue or washing hands afterward prevents further spread. Using her own plates and cups avoids contaminating shared dishes and surfaces, so others won’t pick up the infection from those items.
