Question:
What is Tamal's reason for not being able to go to the Book Fair immediately?

Options:


Correct Answer: He has to take medicine to his grandmother.

Solution:
Solution:

Approach:
- Read the sentence context and locate the clause that gives the reason for Tamal’s inability to go immediately.
- Interpret the meaning of that clause in terms of obligation and priority.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Identify the statement about not going immediately: Tamal “cannot go to the Book Fair immediately.”
2. Find the accompanying reason clause: he “has to take medicine to his grandmother.”
3. Interpret key words: “has to” indicates an obligation or urgent duty that he must fulfill before doing other activities.
4. Apply cause–effect reasoning: because delivering the medicine is an immediate responsibility (its completion is required now), it prevents him from going to the Book Fair at once. After he finishes that duty, he could go.

Relevant concepts:
- Cause and effect: the obligation to deliver medicine is the cause, and inability to go immediately is the effect.
- Priority/obligation: family health needs take precedence over leisure activities.

Conclusion:
Tamal cannot go to the Book Fair immediately because he must first take medicine to his grandmother.

Question:
What does Andy suggest to Tamal when they meet?

Options:


Correct Answer: He suggests going to the Book Fair together.

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Identify the key action Andy proposes in their meeting by focusing on his explicit suggestion and its intent (a joint plan to visit an event).

Working steps:
1. Observe the utterance or reported speech from Andy when they meet — he makes a proposal rather than asking a question or giving information.
2. Interpret the proposal’s content and purpose: the proposal names a destination/event (the Book Fair) and invites shared participation (together).
3. Conclude the direct meaning: Andy is inviting Tamal to accompany him to the Book Fair.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Inference from dialogue: distinguish between statements (facts), questions (requests for information), and suggestions/invitations (proposals for action).
- Pragmatics: a suggestion that includes “together” expresses an intention to share the activity, not merely inform about it.

Logical reasoning:
- Because Andy explicitly offers a plan that names an activity and includes Tamal (“together”), the natural interpretation is that he suggests they go to the Book Fair together.

Final answer:
- He suggests going to the Book Fair together.

Explanation:
Andy suggests going to the Book Fair together because in their conversation he directly proposes they visit it together (for example by saying something like "Let's go to the Book Fair"). A direct invitation using phrases like "let's" or "shall we" shows a suggestion to do an activity together.

Question:
Who is the new English teacher that Tamal introduces to his friends?

Options:


Correct Answer: Ms. Smith.

Solution:
Solution:
1. Approach — Use direct information retrieval from the passage: scan for the sentence where Tamal introduces the new English teacher to his friends.
2. Working steps:
   - Identify the sentence that mentions Tamal introducing someone.
   - Note the name used in that sentence; no inference is required if the name is stated explicitly.
3. Relevant concept — This is a straightforward reading-comprehension task: when a text explicitly names a person in an introduction, the named person is the answer.
4. Logical reasoning — The passage directly states the teacher’s name; therefore we take that statement as the correct answer.

Answer: Ms. Smith.

Explanation:
Ms. Smith is correct because the passage explicitly says that Tamal introduced the new English teacher as Ms. Smith. To answer this you simply locate the sentence where Tamal introduces the teacher and read the name he gives.
