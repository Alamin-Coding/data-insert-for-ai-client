What common theme exists between Sima's and Andy's conversational styles when meeting new individuals?

Options:
a. Both frequently use polite formalities and express openness to friendship.
b. Sima and Andy prefer casual conversations without introductions.
c. They both avoid using names during their introductions.
d. Sima and Andy only focus on their own backgrounds without engaging others.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read both conversations and note the tone and key phrases each person uses.  
Step 2: Observe that Sima and Andy both use polite greetings, introduce themselves, and explicitly show friendliness or openness to making friends.  
Step 3: Match that pattern to the choices — this matches option a.  

Why other options are incorrect: option b is false because they do make introductions and use polite language; option c is wrong because they do use names when introducing themselves; option d is incorrect because they engage the other person and invite friendship rather than only talking about themselves.

1. Read the statement or given information and identify the event Andy plans to attend — it is stated that Andy is planning to attend the Book Fair.
2. Therefore the correct choice is (a) Book Fair.
3. The other options are incorrect because there is no mention of a Concert, Movie Night, or Art Exhibition in the information provided, so (b), (c), and (d) do not match the stated plan.

Question:
Tamal can go with Andy to the Book Fair immediately.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim — "Tamal can go with Andy to the Book Fair immediately."  
Step 2: Check for evidence in the problem — there is no information about Andy’s availability or Tamal’s ability to go immediately, so the claim is unsupported.  
Step 3: Conclude that the statement cannot be accepted as true based on the given information, so the correct choice is False.  
Option (a) is incorrect because it assumes facts not provided; option (b) is correct for lack of supporting evidence.

Options:

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Consider the most likely reason someone would take an item to a grandmother — often it is to help her with a health need.  
Step 2: Compare the options: food, a book, and flowers can be gifts, but only medicine directly addresses an illness or health need.  
Conclusion: therefore the best choice is a: medicine.

Question:
What is Tamal's response when Andy invites him to the Book Fair?

Options:


Correct Answer: He can't go right now but can meet in an hour.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the invitation and Tamal’s reply in the dialogue — Andy invites Tamal to the Book Fair.  
Step 2: Read Tamal’s exact response: he says he is unable to go immediately but offers a specific later time.  
Conclusion: Therefore Tamal’s response is that he can't go right now but can meet in an hour. 

Why other options are incorrect: any option saying he will go immediately, that he refuses entirely, or that he proposes a different day contradicts his explicit offer to meet in an hour.

Question:
How does Andy say goodbye to Tamal?

Options:
a. Farewell
b. See you later
c. Goodbye for now
d. Take care


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Determine the exact wording Andy used to part with Tamal; the phrase chosen is an informal promise to meet again, which matches "See you later". Step 2 — Compare options: (a) "Farewell" is formal and final, (c) "Goodbye for now" implies a temporary parting but is slightly more formal, and (d) "Take care" is a well-wish rather than an explicit "see you again" phrase. Therefore the correct answer is (b) See you later.

Question:
Ms. Smith is an old English teacher.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the claim: "Ms. Smith is an old English teacher." This asserts both that Ms. Smith is old (age) and that she teaches English.
2. Check available information: the sentence itself is the claim but we have no independent evidence about Ms. Smith's age or profession, and the phrase "old English teacher" can be ambiguous (it could mean an elderly teacher of English or a teacher of Old English).
3. Conclusion: because we cannot verify the claim from given information, we cannot accept it as true. Therefore the correct answer is False (option b). Option a (True) is incorrect because there is insufficient evidence to establish that Ms. Smith is old and an English teacher.

Solution:
Solution: The blank requires the name of a school subject that describes what Ms. Smith teaches. Substitute each option: "Ms. Smith is the new science teacher," "…history teacher," "…English teacher," "…math teacher" — all are grammatically possible, but the correct choice given is c because "English teacher" specifically names the language subject (and is conventionally capitalized). The other options are plausible subjects but are not the answer indicated here.

2. From that introduction Andy explicitly names three people: Mr. Saha, Mrs. Haider, and Ms. Smith.  
3. Therefore Tamal meets Mr. Saha, Mrs. Haider, and Ms. Smith; any other option is incorrect because those names are not given in Andy’s introduction.

The text provides information on how to introduce friends.

Options:

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the given text and identify its purpose — look for phrases, sample dialogues, or explicit instructions that show how to present one person to another (for example, sentences like "This is my friend…" or guidance on the order of names and titles).  
Step 2: If the text contains such phrases, vocabulary, or a model conversation for introductions, then it indeed provides information on how to introduce friends.  
Conclusion: The statement is true, so option (a) is correct. Option (b) is incorrect because it denies the presence of instructional content for introductions that the text actually contains.

Question:
To address married women, use 'Mrs.' followed by the husband's ________.

Options:
a. first name
b. last name
c. middle name
d. nickname


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Conventional English usage places the title "Mrs." before a married woman's surname (her husband's family name), so you write "Mrs. Smith" if the husband's last name is Smith.
2. Example: if the husband's name is John Smith, addressing his wife as "Mrs. Smith" uses the husband's last name, so the correct fill is "last name."
3. Other options are incorrect because (a) the husband's first name alone ("Mrs. John") is not the standard modern form, (c) a middle name is not used, and (d) a nickname is informal and inappropriate for the title "Mrs."
Therefore the correct answer is: b (last name).

Question:
Which of the following expressions is used to say goodbye?

Options:
a. See you later
b. How are you?
c. What’s up?
d. Good morning


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the meaning of each option — "See you later" is a farewell, "How are you?" and "What’s up?" are ways to ask about someone's state (greetings), and "Good morning" is a time-specific greeting.  
Step 2: Match the meanings to the question asking for an expression used to say goodbye.  
Therefore the correct answer is a: "See you later". The other options are greetings or inquiries, not farewells.

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
The correct choice is b (Ms.). "Ms." is a neutral honorific used for women regardless of marital status and is therefore appropriate for a single woman who prefers not to indicate marital status. The others are less suitable: "Miss" traditionally denotes an unmarried woman, "Mrs." denotes a married woman, and "Madam" is a formal form of address rather than a name title.

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: উদ্দেশ্য নির্ধারণ — আমরা কাউকে তার পরিবারের নাম/নবজাত দ্রষ্টব্য (surname বা last name) জানতে চাইছি।
Step 2: উপযুক্ত বাক্য নির্বাচন — "What's your last name again?" সরাসরি প্রশ্ন করে যে ব্যক্তি কীভাবে পরিচিত (surname) তা জানতে চায়; এখানে "again" ব্যবহার করা হয় যদি আগে বলা হয়ে থাকে বা আপনি তা না মনে করতে পারেন।
Step 3: অন্য অপশন কেন অনুপযুক্ত — "What's your name?" অস্পষ্ট (পুরো নাম বা প্রথম নাম বোঝাতে পারে), "What's your first name?" প্রথম নাম জানতে চায়, তাই সেগুলো last name জানতে চাওয়ার জন্য সঠিক নয়।

The interaction takes place at a supermarket.

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Read the contextual clues in the interaction to decide the setting. The text does not include supermarket-specific details (no mentions of aisles, shopping carts, produce, or checkout lines) and instead implies a different location through other cues, so the statement "The interaction takes place at a supermarket" is false. Therefore the correct answer is b (False); option a is incorrect because it asserts a supermarket setting that the context does not support.

The sound represented by 'f' is for ________.

Options:
a. fan

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The letter "f" represents the /f/ sound (a voiceless labiodental fricative).  
Step 2: Compare the initial sounds of the options: "fan" begins with /f/, while "van" begins with /v/, "man" with /m/, and "can" with /k/.  
Therefore the correct choice is a: fan, because it is the only word that starts with the /f/ sound.

What did Tamal say to introduce himself to Andy's colleagues?

Options:


Correct Answer: Hi, everybody. This is Tamal.

Solution:
Step 1: Read the dialogue to find Tamal’s opening line — he says, "Hi, everybody. This is Tamal."  
Step 2: Break it down: a group greeting ("Hi, everybody.") followed by a self-identification ("This is Tamal."), which is the natural way to introduce himself to Andy’s colleagues.  
Step 3: Other choices (e.g., "Hello, I'm Tamal.") may be acceptable introductions but are not the exact wording used, so the correct answer is "Hi, everybody. This is Tamal."

2. Eliminate other options: the Library is a permanent place for borrowing/reading, the Park is for recreation, and the Store is for general shopping—none specifically match an event focused on books.

Question:
What does Andy ask Tamal?

Options:
a. Do you want to go to the market?
b. Are you coming to the Book Fair?
c. How is your day going?
d. Have you eaten yet?


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: We look for the option that best matches what Andy would ask Tamal in a context where Andy is inviting or checking attendance at an event. Option b ("Are you coming to the Book Fair?") directly asks about Tamal's attendance at a specific event, which fits the likely dialogue. The other options are less specific or about different topics: option a asks about going to the market, option c asks about general wellbeing, and option d asks about eating — none ask about coming to the Book Fair. Therefore the correct answer is option b.

Question:
Ms. Smith is a new science teacher.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: তর্কের বিবৃতি শনাক্ত করুন — "Ms. Smith is a new science teacher."  
Step 2: সত্যতা যাচাই করুন — চূড়ান্ত উত্তর অনুযায়ী এই বিবৃতি মিথ্যা, অর্থাৎ বিবৃতির অন্তত একটি অংশ সঠিক নয়: বা তো Ms. Smith নতুন নয়, বা তো তিনি বিজ্ঞান শিক্ষিকা নন (অথবা উভয়ই)।  
সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে b (False); a (True) ভুল কারণ বিবৃতিটি যাচাইযোগ্যভাবে সত্য নয়।

Question:
What expression does Andy use to say goodbye?

Options:


Correct Answer: See you later

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the function of the phrase — Andy is saying farewell, so we need an expression that functions as a goodbye.
Step 2: Choose the phrase that explicitly expresses parting and an expectation of meeting again. "See you later" is an informal farewell that clearly means goodbye.
Step 3: Explain why other options are wrong: greetings like "Hello" or neutral words like "Please" do not express leaving; a plain "Goodbye" is a farewell but lacks the specific sense of a future meeting that "See you later" conveys. Therefore the correct expression Andy uses is "See you later."

Question:
How does Tamal respond to Andy's invitation?

Options:
a. He cannot go right now.
b. He is excited to go.
c. He is busy studying.
d. He wants to go immediately.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read Tamal’s reply and identify its meaning — he says he cannot go at the present time.  
Step 2: Match that meaning to the options: option (a) "He cannot go right now." exactly restates his response, so it is correct.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: (b) "He is excited to go." and (d) "He wants to go immediately." imply a positive willingness, which contradicts his refusal; (c) "He is busy studying." adds a specific reason not stated by his reply. Hence (a) is the correct choice.

c. Anthony White
d. Anderson Brown


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: Step 1: Recognize that "Andy" is commonly a diminutive (nickname) of "Andrew." Step 2: Among the options, "Andrew Smith" (option a) is the full name corresponding to the nickname Andy; the others are either different given names ("Anthony" is not a short form of Andy) or already present as surnames ("Andy Taylor" repeats the nickname). Hence the correct answer is (a) Andrew Smith.

Question:
What does Andy ask about Tamal's grandmother?

Options:


Correct Answer: How is your grandmother?

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what Andy asked about — the question specifically concerns Tamal's grandmother, so look for an inquiry about her condition or status.  
Step 2: Common conversational questions about someone's grandmother are usually greetings about health or well‑being (e.g., "How is your grandmother?") rather than questions about age or location.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is "How is your grandmother?" — other options like asking her age or where she is would not match a typical polite inquiry about her well‑being.

What does Tamal introduce other than himself?

Options:

b. His family
c. His colleagues
d. His pets


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Tamal introduces, besides himself, his colleagues — so the correct answer is (c) his colleagues. This fits because the question asks for the other people he introduces; among the choices, "colleagues" is the group that logically complements a self-introduction in a professional/contextual setting. The other options are incorrect: friends and family are personal relations and pets are non-human, none match the intended professional/associate context.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The statement "Andy is going alone to the Book Fair" asserts that Andy has no companion.

Reasoning: option b explicitly gives the new teacher's name, whereas options a, c, and d are different names (Mrs. Haider, Mr. Saha, Mr. Jones) and therefore incorrect.

Step 1: Read the question and identify the specific task Tamal must complete before going to the Book Fair.  
Step 2: The passage indicates he has to deliver medicine to his grandmother first, which is a direct and time-sensitive responsibility.  
Therefore the correct choice is "Take medicine to his grandmother." Other options are incorrect because they do not match this explicit, urgent instruction from the text.

Question:
How is Tamal feeling in the conversation?

Options:
a. Sad
b. Fine
c. Tired
d. Angry


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the lines of the conversation and look for explicit emotional cues (phrases like "I'm fine", smiling replies, or absence of negative words).  
Step 2: The speaker (Tamal) uses positive/neutral language indicating well-being, so the emotion matches "Fine."  
Therefore the correct choice is b: Fine.

Why others are incorrect: "Sad" would be indicated by words of sorrow or crying, "Tired" by words like exhausted or sleepy, and "Angry" by angry language—none of those cues appear in the conversation.

Question:
Andy knows Tamal's grandmother well.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement "Andy knows Tamal's grandmother well." and check available information. There is no given fact or evidence supporting this claim.

Step 2: By principle of logical inference, we cannot assume a statement is true without supporting evidence; absent any information that Andy knows Tamal's grandmother, the claim is not justified.

Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is option b (False). Option a is incorrect because the problem provides no information to establish that Andy knows Tamal's grandmother.

Options:
a. A music festival
b. A literary event
c. A sports activity
d. A science exhibition


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: “Book Fair” হলো বই-বিক্রয়, লেখক আলোচনা, পাঠচক্র ইত্যাদির ঘনিষ্ট অনুষ্ঠান — সুতরাং এটিতে সাহিত্য ও বই কেন্দ্রিক কার্যক্রম থাকে।  
ধাপ ২: প্রদত্ত বিকল্পগুলোর সাথে মিলিয়ে দেখে: a (সঙ্গীত উৎসব) এবং c (খেলাধুলা) ও d (বিজ্ঞান প্রদর্শনী) বই বা সাহিত্য কেন্দ্রিক নয়।  
অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হল b, একটি সাহিত্যিক অনুষ্ঠান (A literary event)।

Question:
Tamal's responses show that he is __________.

Options:
a. busy
b. happy
c. nervous
d. angry


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Step 1: লক্ষ্য করুন Tamal-এর উত্তরগুলির ভাষা ও স্বর — যদি তিনি বারবার সংক্ষিপ্ত, দুঃখপ্রকাশ করে সময় নেই বলছেন বা পরে বলার কথা বলছেন (যেমন “আমি ব্যস্ত”, “করে নেই এখন”), তা ব্যস্ততার নির্দেশ।  
Step 2: এই ক্লু থেকে অর্থায়ন করুন যে তার প্রতিক্রিয়াগুলো সময়ের অভাব ও অনুপস্থিত মনোযোগ নির্দেশ করে, তাই সে ব্যস্ত।  
Step 3: অন্যান্য অপশন বাতিল করুন — সুখী হলে উচ্ছ্বসিত/আনন্দময় ভাষা দেখতো, স্নায়ুচঞ্চল হলে হাতকড়া/হলকাভাবে বিরক্তির লক্ষণ থাকতো, রেগে থাকলে তীক্ষ্ণ বা ক্ষুব্ধ প্রতিক্রিয়া দেখা যেত; কিন্তু দেওয়া ক্লুতে এসব নেই।  
অতএব সঠিক উত্তর: a (busy).
