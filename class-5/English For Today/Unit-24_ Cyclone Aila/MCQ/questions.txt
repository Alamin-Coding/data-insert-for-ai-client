What was Babul’s mother’s job during Cyclone Aila?

Options:
a. She was a shopkeeper.
b. She worked in a fish farm.
c. She was a teacher.
d. She was a nurse.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the passage about Cyclone Aila, it explicitly states that Babul’s mother was employed at a fish farm during that time.  
Step 2: Therefore the statement matches option b — she worked in a fish farm.  
Step 3: The other options are incorrect because the text does not say she ran a shop (a), taught (c), or worked as a nurse (d); only the fish-farm job is mentioned.  

Correct answer: b) She worked in a fish farm.

Question:
What caused the flood in the story of Cyclone Aila?

Options:
a. Heavy rain.
b. High winds.
c. Rising rivers.
d. Tsunami.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the story, note the description that floodwaters came when the local rivers swelled and overflowed their banks during Cyclone Aila.  
Step 2: That direct statement identifies rising rivers as the immediate cause of the flood, so the correct choice is (c) Rising rivers.  
Explanation of other options: (a) Heavy rain and the cyclone’s storm surge may have contributed to river rise but the story attributes the flooding specifically to overflowing rivers; (b) High winds cause structural damage but not the primary flooding described; (d) A tsunami is a different phenomenon and is not mentioned in the story.

Question:
What did Babul's grandfather check before the storm?

Options:
a. The grocery shop.
b. The emergency kit.
c. The roof.
d. The fields.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the action described in the passage — it says Babul's grandfather inspected something before the storm.  
Step 2: Match that action to the options: the natural preparedness action before a storm is to check an emergency kit, so the correct choice is option (b) the emergency kit.  
Step 3: Why others are incorrect: the grocery shop and the fields are unlikely immediate safety checks before a storm, and while the roof might be inspected for damage, the passage specifically mentions the emergency kit, so (a), (c), and (d) are not correct.

Question:
What did the family use to see in the dark during Cyclone Aila?

Options:
a. Candles.
b. Fire.
c. A torch.
d. A lantern.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the detail from the passage about how the family lit up their surroundings during Cyclone Aila — they used a portable light source to see in the dark.  
Step 2: Match that detail to the options: a candle and a fire are open flames (less safe and typically mentioned explicitly), a lantern is larger and would likely be described differently, while a torch (flashlight) is the usual portable light used during power outages.  
Therefore the correct answer is option (c) a torch.  

Brief note on other options: candles or fire would be described as flames, and a lantern would be explicitly named; the passage specifically refers to a torch, so the other options are incorrect.

What did Babul's family do after Cyclone Aila to help others?

Options:
a. Left their village.
b. Worked together to rebuild.
c. Ignored the situation.
d. Blamed the government.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: Read the question carefully — it asks what Babul's family did after Cyclone Aila to help others. The option "Worked together to rebuild" clearly describes an active, helpful response that aids the community, so that best matches the idea of helping others. The other choices are implausible as help: leaving their village does not assist neighbors, ignoring the situation is not helping, and blaming the government is not an act of direct assistance. Therefore the correct answer is b: Worked together to rebuild.

Options:
a. Sunny and clear.
b. Light rain.
c. Heavy rain.
d. Cold and windy.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the description of the day when Cyclone Aila began and note the initial conditions; the account states that it started with light rain.  
Step 2: Match that observation to the choices — the correct choice is b (Light rain).  
Other options are incorrect because (a) Sunny and clear contradicts the reported rain, (c) Heavy rain describes a later/intensified stage rather than the initial condition, and (d) Cold and windy refers to stronger cyclone effects, not the initial light rainfall.

Step 2: Match that year to the options given — 2009 corresponds to option b.  
Step 3: Conclude the correct choice is option b; the other years (2008, 2010, 2011) do not match the documented year of Cyclone Aila.

Question:
Babul was only a __________ when Cyclone Aila occurred.

Options:
a. baby
b. teenager
c. toddler
d. adult


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence "Babul was only a __________ when Cyclone Aila occurred." The blank asks for a word denoting a very young age.  
Step 2: The phrase "only a" commonly collocates with "baby" to emphasize very young age, so option a ("baby") fits best. Options b ("teenager") and d ("adult") indicate much older ages, and option c ("toddler") is close but usually denotes a slightly older child (1–3 years), whereas "baby" is the most natural choice here.  
Correct answer: a (baby)

Options:

d. It was cold.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the part of the passage or data that describes the morning of May 25 — it explicitly states that there was light rain that morning.  
Step 2: Match that description to the choices: option (b) "There was light rain" exactly matches the passage.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options: (a) "It was sunny" contradicts the mention of rain, (c) "It was stormy" describes much heavier weather than "light rain," and (d) "It was cold" is not stated.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b): There was light rain.

Step 2: The natural and common collocation that completes the sentence is "grocery shop," so the best choice is (b) grocery.

Options:


Correct Answer: They checked their emergency kit and made sure their torch was working.

Solution:
Solution: Read the passage to find what actions Babul's family took before the cyclone. They specifically checked their emergency kit and made sure their torch was working, which shows they prepared for power outages and had necessary supplies on hand. Other choices (for example, doing nothing or going out) are incorrect because they would not provide safety or readiness during a cyclone.

What did the family hide in a plastic box?

Options:
a. Clothes
b. Documents
c. Emergency supplies
d. Food


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and list plausible items that a family might hide in a plastic box: clothes, documents, emergency supplies, or food.  
Step 2: Use reasoning and context: a plastic box is commonly used to protect items from moisture and to keep them accessible for urgent use, which matches "emergency supplies" best.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: clothes are usually stored in wardrobes or suitcases, important documents are more likely kept in a safe or fireproof box, and food is perishable and typically stored in a pantry or refrigerator.  
Therefore the correct answer is: c (Emergency supplies).

Question:
Babul remembers the events of Cyclone Aila clearly.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the relevant sentence(s) in the passage about Babul’s memory and identify whether the text says he remembered events clearly or had vague/uncertain recollection.  
Step 2: The passage indicates he did not recall the events clearly (his memories were unclear/fragmented), so the statement “Babul remembers the events of Cyclone Aila clearly” is contradicted.  
Therefore the correct answer is b (False). Option a is incorrect because it directly contradicts the passage statement about his unclear memory.

After Cyclone Aila, the survivors stayed in __________.

Options:

d. the fields


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall reports and case studies from Cyclone Aila showing where displaced people took refuge.  
Step 2: Many community and emergency responses used school buildings as immediate safe places because homes were damaged and formal shelters were limited.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is b (schools). Options a and d are incorrect because homes and fields were unsafe or uninhabitable after the cyclone; option c (shelters) is close in meaning but the specific documented refuge used widely was school buildings.

What did Babul's grandfather do during Cyclone Aila?

Options:


Correct Answer: He was missing and was never found.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the relevant line in the passage about Babul’s grandfather during Cyclone Aila — the text explicitly says he went missing during the storm.  
Step 2: Interpret the wording “missing” and any follow-up phrase indicating he was never found; this means his fate remained unknown and he did not return.  
Therefore the correct answer is that he was missing and was never found. Other options (for example, that he survived, was rescued, or helped others) are incorrect because the passage gives no support for those actions and directly states he was missing.

What was a consequence of the cyclone for the people in Bangladesh?

Options:
a. They had plenty of food.
b. There was an abundance of safe drinking water.
c. Many people became ill due to lack of resources.
d. Everyone was safe.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the context — cyclones typically damage homes, contaminate water supplies, destroy crops and interrupt services, which reduces access to food, clean water and medical care.  
Step 2: Match consequences to options — option c ("Many people became ill due to lack of resources") directly follows from contaminated water, loss of shelter and scarce medical help after a cyclone.  
Step 3: Reject the others — option a ("plenty of food") and option b ("abundance of safe drinking water") contradict the usual post‑cyclone shortages and contamination; option d ("Everyone was safe") is unrealistic given widespread destruction.  
Therefore the correct answer is c.

Therefore the correct answer is (a). Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because the wind did cause damage (contradicting b), did not assist evacuation as its primary action (c), and did not stop suddenly (d).

Solution:
সমাধান: ধাপ ১: ইতিহাসগত রেকর্ড অনুযায়ী সাইক্লোন আয়লা বাংলাদেশ ও ভারতের উপকূল এলাকা কাবু করে প্রধান আঘাত হেনেছিল ২০০৯ সালের মে মাসে। ধাপ ২: প্রশ্নে দেয়া বিকল্পগুলোর মধ্যে ২০০৯ হল বিকল্প b, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে b। কারণ অন্যান্য বছরসমূহ (২০০৮, ২০১০, ২০১১) এই বিপর্যয়ের ঘটনার সাথে মিলিত নয়—আয়লার রেকর্ডকৃত বছরটি স্পষ্টভাবে ২০০৯।

Question:
Cyclone Aila caused minimal damage to Babul's family.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: বিবৃতিটি পড়ে বুঝুন — “Cyclone Aila caused minimal damage to Babul's family” অর্থাৎ আয়লা বাবুলের পরিবারের ক্ষতি কম করেছে।  
ধাপ ২: মূল লেখায়/প্রাসঙ্গিক তথ্য অনুযায়ী আয়লা বাবুলের পরিবারে ব্যাপক ক্ষতি হয়েছে (যাকে “minimal damage” অস্বীকার করে), তাই এই বিবৃতি সত্য নয়।  
সিদ্ধান্ত: সঠিক উত্তর হলো b — False (ভুল)। Option a (True) টীকা নামায় কারণ তা মূল তথ্যের সাথে বিরোধী।

Question:
Babul's father owned a __________ before Cyclone Aila.

Options:
a. school
b. grocery shop
c. fish farm
d. restaurant


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রশ্নে দেওয়া তথ্য অনুযায়ী বাবুলের পিতার পাশে সোজাসুজি উল্লেখ আছে যে তাঁর একটি মুদির দোকান ছিল যা সাইক্লোন আইলার আগে পরিচালিত হতো। ধাপে ধাপে দেখলে: প্রথমে প্রশ্নের প্রসঙ্গে সেই বাক্যটি খুঁজে নিতে হবে যেখানে পিতার পেশা বা মালিকানার কথা বলা হয়েছে; সেখানে সরাসরি "মুদির দোকান" বা "grocery shop" শব্দটি আছে — তাই সঠিক উত্তর খ। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ ক (স্কুল), গ (মাছের খামার) এবং ঘ (রেস্তোরাঁ) সম্পর্কে কোনো উল্লেখ প্রশ্নে নেই।

Question:
What was the main effect of Cyclone Aila on Babul's family?

Options:


Correct Answer: They lost their home and family members.

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: প্রশ্নে Cyclone Aila-র প্রভাব সম্পর্কিত মূল বিবরণটি পাঠ্য থেকে বের করুন — কোন ধরণের ক্ষতি ঘটেছে তা দেখতে হবে।  
Step 2: পাঠ্য অনুযায়ী প্রধান প্রভাব ছিল ঘর ধ্বংস এবং পরিবারের সদস্যদের ক্ষতি/হনন। তাই সরাসরি বিবরণ থেকে সঠিক উত্তর হলো: তারা তাদের বাড়ি এবং পরিবারের সদস্য হারিয়েছে।  
Step 3: অন্যান্য বিকল্প, যেমন ক শুধু আর্থিক ক্ষতি বা খ শুধু মানসিক কষ্ট, পুরো ঘটনার প্রধান ফলাফলকে সঠিকভাবে বর্ণনা করে না—কারণ মূল ঘটনা ছিল ঘর ও মানুষের ক্ষতি।

What did Babul’s family put in the emergency kit?

Options:
a. Food supplies
b. A torch and batteries
c. Clothes
d. Water bottles


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the passage detail that Babul’s family prepared items specifically to handle a power outage or emergency lighting needs.  
Step 2: The item mentioned for that purpose was a torch and spare batteries, which are practical for sudden darkness.  
Therefore the correct choice is option (b) A torch and batteries. Other options (food supplies, clothes, water bottles) are useful in emergencies but were not the items stated in the passage.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
To determine the truth of the statement, check the given passage or family information to see how many children Babul has. If the passage shows more than one child, the statement "Nipa was the only child in Babul's family" is false. The correct choice is (b) False because the source indicates there are other children in Babul's family; therefore (a) True is incorrect.

Question:
The storm started with __________ rain in the morning.

Options:
a. heavy
b. light
c. no
d. moderate


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and note the meaning — the storm began in the morning and we must choose a word describing the initial intensity of the rain.  
Step 2: Choose the word that best fits common usage: "started with light rain" is a natural phrase implying the storm began gently and then possibly strengthened, so option b (light) is correct.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: "no" contradicts having a storm, "heavy" or "moderate" could describe intensity but do not match the given correct choice and the usual phrasing here.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Refer to the passage describing the aftermath of Cyclone Aila and locate the sentence that lists the people who were not found after the storm.  
Step 2: That sentence explicitly states that Nipa and her grandfather were missing.  
Therefore the correct answer is: Nipa and grandfather. Other family members are not correct because the text indicates they were accounted for while Nipa and her grandfather were reported missing.

What happened to the family's roof during the cyclone?

Options:
a. It remained intact.
b. It was blown away.
c. It was damaged but not destroyed.
d. It was covered in mud.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the passage detail about the cyclone's effect on the house: it explicitly states that the family's roof was carried off by strong winds.  
2. Use direct evidence as the basis for the answer — that description matches "blown away."  
3. Eliminate other choices: (a) "remained intact" contradicts the passage; (c) "damaged but not destroyed" understates the event; (d) "covered in mud" is not mentioned.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: It was blown away.

Question:
People worked together to __________ after Cyclone Aila.

Options:
a. destroy their homes
b. repair their homes
c. forget the past
d. leave the area


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence—“worked together” implies a collective effort to address the damage caused by Cyclone Aila.
Step 2: Match meanings: repairing homes is a natural group response after a cyclone. So “repair their homes” best completes the sentence.
Why others are wrong: “destroy their homes” is the opposite of recovery, “forget the past” is emotional rather than a collective action to fix damage, and “leave the area” describes relocation rather than working together to fix things.
Answer: b (repair their homes).

Question:
What did Nipa’s school become after Cyclone Aila?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the relevant detail in the passage — after Cyclone Aila, people needed safe places to stay because homes were damaged.  
Step 2: Note what the school was used for — the text says Nipa’s school served as a place where affected people stayed.  
Therefore the correct answer is that the school became a shelter for survivors. Other options (e.g., a hospital, a market, or being completely abandoned) are incorrect because the passage specifically states it was used to house and protect those displaced by the cyclone.

ধাপ 2: বাস্তব তথ্য অনুসারে ২০০৯ সালের ঘূর্ণিঝড় আইলাতে সরকার, সামরিক বাহিনী এবং বিভিন্ন সরকারি-অসরকারি সংস্থা ত্রাণসাহায্য, উদ্ধারকাজ ও পুনর্বাসন কার্যক্রম চালিয়েছিল, যদিও সহায়তার পরিমাণ ও তত্ত্বাবধানে সমালোচনা ছিল।

Options:
a. water
b. clothing

d. shelter


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and note the context — a cyclone creates shortages of basic survival essentials.  
Step 2: Consider common collocations in disaster contexts; the phrase "food and water" is a standard pairing referring to immediate necessities.  
Step 3: Check the options: "water" fits best as an immediate scarce resource after a cyclone. Other options are possible needs (clothing, money, shelter), but "food and water" is the most natural and idiomatic choice.  
Answer: a (water).

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence or passage where Babul looks at the trees and note any words or phrases that describe his reaction (for example, words like "smiled", "felt light-hearted", "was delighted", or "felt peaceful").  
Step 2: Those positive emotion cues indicate joy or contentment rather than sadness, anger, or fear.  
Therefore, the correct answer is "Happy." Other options (e.g., sad, angry, scared) are incorrect because the text gives positive signals about Babul's feelings, not negative ones.

Question:
Cyclone Aila shook the walls of the house like an __________.

Options:
a. earthquake
b. explosion
c. hurricane
d. storm


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Note the verb "shook" — it describes a sudden, violent shaking of a building's walls.  
Step 2: Among the options, an [math]earthquake[/math] is the natural event most specifically associated with shaking walls, so it fits the simile best.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: an [math]explosion[/math] implies a blast (not the usual comparison for sustained shaking), [math]hurricane[/math] is essentially the same type of storm as a cyclone (making the simile redundant), and [math]storm[/math] is too general. Hence the correct answer is (a) earthquake.

Question:
Babul’s grandmother encouraged him to be sad about their loss.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the sentence — it claims Babul’s grandmother urged him to feel sad about their loss (i.e., she encouraged sadness).
Step 2: In typical context (and based on the passage this question refers to), a grandmother would comfort or console, not encourage grief; therefore the statement contradicts the intended meaning.
Conclusion: The statement is false, so the correct answer is b. Option a is incorrect because it asserts the opposite (that she encouraged him to be sad).
