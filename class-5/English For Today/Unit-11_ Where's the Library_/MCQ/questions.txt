Question:
How do the directions given in Chapter 1618 reflect the necessity of clear communication when navigating unfamiliar areas?

Options:
a. They require the use of complex language.
b. They must include personal opinions on locations.
c. They highlight the significance of accurate landmarks.
d. They focus on the distance rather than the direction.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main purpose of directions in Chapter 1618 — to help someone navigate unfamiliar areas reliably by conveying where to go and what to look for.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that purpose. Option (a) is wrong because complex language hinders clear communication; (b) is wrong because personal opinions do not provide verifiable guidance; (d) is incomplete because distance alone doesn’t help if landmarks or bearings are unclear.  
Step 3: Conclude that (c) is correct: accurate landmarks provide concrete, observable references that make directions usable and reduce confusion when navigating unfamiliar places.

Question:
In the context of giving directions, how do the dialogues in Chapter 1618 reflect the importance of prepositions?

Options:
a. They demonstrate the need for polite requests.
b. They clarify location with specific terms.
c. They emphasize the use of commands.
d. They focus on the distance between locations.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main function of the dialogues — they are giving directions, so the primary language feature used is prepositions that show spatial relations (e.g., "next to", "behind", "across from").  
Step 2: Reasoning — these prepositions clarify where places are relative to each other, which matches option b.  
Step 3: Why others are incorrect — option a (polite requests) may appear but is peripheral, option c (commands) is not the main point, and option d (distance) is more about measurement than the positional clarification that prepositions provide.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
What is the primary purpose of the text?

Options:
a. To provide a history of libraries
b. To give directions to various locations
c. To describe the layout of a college
d. To explain the importance of maps


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Read the text for its main clues — if it contains place names, directions, distances or instructions like "turn left", "entrance" or "next to", those indicate it’s giving directions. From these clues the primary purpose matches option b, to give directions to various locations. Other options are incorrect because the text does not narrate history (not a historical account), does not primarily describe an internal building layout (no room-by-room description), and does not discuss why maps are important (no explanatory or argumentative content).

Step 2: Since the text directly states that fact, the statement is true.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a) True; option (b) False is incorrect because it contradicts the explicit information in the text.

Question:
The library is located __________ to the college.

Options:
a. behind
b. next
c. in front
d. far from


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence "The library is located __________ to the college." The phrase after the blank is "to the college", so we need a word that naturally pairs with "to" to express position.
Step 2: The correct collocation is "next to" meaning adjacent. Option (b) "next" supplies that pairing (implicitly forming "next to"), so (b) is correct.
Step 3: Why the others are wrong: "behind" and "in front" do not pair with "to" (we would say "behind the college" or "in front of the college"), and "far from" uses "from" not "to" and indicates distance rather than adjacency.

Question:
What did Salman ask for in the dialogue?

Options:


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the dialogue and locate Salman's line to see what he is asking for. The line explicitly asks for help finding the library, so his request is for directions to the library.
2. Match this to the given options: the option "Directions to the library" exactly describes that request.
3. Eliminate other options (e.g., asking for the time, borrowing a book, or making an appointment) because none of those match the content of his question in the dialogue.

Therefore, the correct answer is: Directions to the library.

Question:
Which preposition is used to describe the location of the hospital in the text?

Options:
a. behind
b. on
c. next to
d. opposite


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the phrase in the text that describes the hospital’s position — it uses the word "opposite," which indicates the hospital is facing something across from it.  
Step 2: Interpret meanings: "opposite" means located across from (e.g., across the street), whereas "behind" means at the rear, "on" implies on top of or at a surface, and "next to" means immediately beside.  
Therefore the correct preposition is option d: opposite.

Question:
The text suggests using commands when giving directions.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the purpose of the text—when giving directions it aims to tell the listener what to do.  
Step 2: The most effective way to do that is to use imperative sentences (commands) because they are clear and direct.  
Therefore the correct answer is a (True). Option b (False) is incorrect because avoiding commands would make directions less explicit and harder to follow.

Type: MCQ | Book: English For Today | Years:  | Boards:  | Tags: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
How far is the hospital from the discussed location?

Options:


Correct Answer: Five minutes' walk

Solution:
Solution:
1) The phrase “Five minutes' walk” directly gives the travel time on foot: [math]5\ \text{minutes}[/math].  
2) Converting to hours: [math]5\ \text{minutes} = \frac{5}{60}\ \text{hours}[/math]. Using a typical walking speed (about [math]5\ \text{km/h}[/math]), distance = speed × time = [math]5\times\frac{5}{60}=\frac{25}{60}\approx0.4167\ \text{km}[/math], i.e. roughly [math]400\text{–}420\ \text{m}[/math].  
3) Therefore the correct answer is “Five minutes' walk.” Any other option giving a different time or distance would not match the stated walking time.

Question:
Which expression is suggested for getting someone's attention?

Options:
a. Excuse me!
b. Could you help me?
c. Pardon me?
d. Hey there!


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — a polite, common phrase used to get someone's attention in public.  
Step 2: Compare options: option (a) "Excuse me!" is the standard polite attention-getter; (b) "Could you help me?" asks for assistance rather than just gaining attention; (c) "Pardon me?" usually asks someone to repeat or expresses surprise/apology; (d) "Hey there!" is an informal greeting, not a polite attention-getter.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a) "Excuse me!" because it directly and politely attracts someone's attention.

Question:
The girl is located in front of the window according to the text.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Locate the textual evidence — the passage explicitly states the girl's position as "in front of the window" (this is the phrase indicating location).  
Step 2: Interpret the preposition "in front of" to mean she is positioned before/near the window on the side facing it.  
Conclusion: The statement is True, so option a is correct. Option b is incorrect because it contradicts the explicit description in the text.

Question:
The butterflies are __________ the tree.

Options:
a. in front of
b. next to
c. behind
d. inside


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look at the relative position of the butterflies and the tree — they are located immediately beside the trunk, touching or very close to its side.  
Step 2: The English preposition that means “beside” or “at the side of” is "next to", so the correct choice is option b.  
Step 3: Other options are incorrect because "in front of" implies they are ahead of the tree, "behind" means on the far side, and "inside" means within the tree; none match the butterflies’ side-by-side position.

Question:
To get to the supermarket, turn __________ on Park Street.

Options:
a. left
b. right
c. straight
d. around


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the common phrase pattern "turn ___ on Park Street" requires a direction to indicate making a turn onto that street.  
Step 2: The natural and grammatical choice is "left" — "turn left on Park Street" correctly tells someone to make a left turn onto Park Street, so the correct answer is (a) left.  
Explanation of other options: "right" would be the opposite direction, "straight" is used as "go straight on Park Street" (not "turn straight"), and "around" is ungrammatical in this context.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The statement "A supermarket is located next to the library" is a factual claim about location. Since no supporting information or evidence is given to confirm this specific spatial relationship, we cannot accept it as true. Therefore the correct choice is b (False); option a (True) is incorrect because the claim is unsupported.

Options:
a. near
b. far
c. next

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: Identify the meaning needed — the blank should express proximity to the current location. Choose "near" because it directly indicates closeness; the sentence reads correctly as "The hospital is near the current location." Other options are incorrect: "far" means the opposite (distant), "next" would need "to" as in "next to" and implies immediate adjacency, and "behind" specifies a relative position rather than general closeness.

Step 1: Understand the phrase "the place next to the library" means a position adjacent to or beside the library.
Step 2: Compare the options: "next to" clearly means beside (adjacent), while "behind" means at the back of the library, "opposite" means facing the library across from it, and "far from" means at a distance.

Options:


Correct Answer: Turn left or right.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the intended movement and the reference point (e.g., an intersection or landmark).  
Step 2: Use a concise imperative that changes the travel direction — saying "Turn left" or "Turn right" gives a clear, actionable instruction that tells the listener exactly which way to change course.  
Step 3: Other phrases like "go" or "walk" are less specific about direction, so they are not as effective when you need to indicate a change in direction.

a. The location is far away.
b. The location is easy to reach.
c. The location is closed.
d. The location has many people.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The phrase "It's very near!" describes proximity — something is a short distance away. Step 1: Understand that "near" means close in distance or time, so it implies ease of getting there. Step 2: Compare options: (a) states the opposite (far away), (c) (closed) and (d) (has many people) are unrelated to distance. Therefore the correct choice is (b) — the location is easy to reach.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the spatial relation required — the sentence asks which preposition indicates moving to the area facing the bus stop to reach the school.  
Step 2: Choose the preposition that denotes being on the front side or facing side of the bus stop: "in front of" fits this meaning, so the correct answer is (b) in front of.  
Step 3: Why the others are wrong — "behind" means at the rear of the bus stop, "next to" means beside it (not specifically the facing side), and "opposite" means across from it; none convey the intended direction toward the school's location.

Question:
You can give directions without using prepositions.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Define the terms — "giving directions" typically requires indicating spatial relationships (e.g., where something is located relative to something else).  
Step 2: Prepositions (like "left of", "behind", "next to", "across from") are the standard grammatical tools used to express those spatial relations when giving directions.  
Step 3: Because expressing spatial relationships normally requires prepositions, the statement "You can give directions without using prepositions" is false. Therefore the correct answer is b.

Solution: The phrasal verb "act out" means to perform or dramatize something, so it most naturally collocates with "the dialogues" (performing lines/role-play). Options like "the homework" or "the exam" are tasks to complete, not perform, and "the instructions" are followed rather than acted out. Therefore the correct answer is option a: the dialogues.

Question:
You must always use polite language when giving directions.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the statement — giving directions is an interpersonal act intended to help someone find a place or complete a task.  
Step 2: Polite language fosters clarity, reduces defensiveness, and increases the likelihood the listener will follow the directions.  
Step 3: Therefore the statement is true; select option a.  
Why option b is incorrect: Being impolite can cause confusion or offense and may make people less willing to cooperate, so "False" is not appropriate.

Question:
What is the main subject of the first dialogue?

Options:
a. Finding a library
b. Asking for a restaurant
c. Getting to a hospital
d. Directions to a bank


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the first dialogue and identify the central topic — look for repeated keywords or the main request (e.g., asking where to find books or a building called a library).  
Step 2: Determine that the speakers are asking about the location of a library, so the main subject is "Finding a library."  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: asking for a restaurant, getting to a hospital, or directions to a bank are not supported by the dialogue’s content. Therefore the correct answer is a: Finding a library.
