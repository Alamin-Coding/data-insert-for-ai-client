Question:
Anousha prefers football over cricket, which is her favorite sport.

Options:
a. False
b. True


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — parse the sentence and check for logical consistency.

Step 1 — parse the clauses:
- "Anousha prefers football over cricket" means Anousha likes football more than cricket (football > cricket).
- The relative clause "which is her favorite sport" grammatically attaches to the nearest noun "cricket," so it asserts "cricket is her favorite sport" (cricket = favorite).

Step 2 — check consistency:
- If football is preferred over cricket, then football should be her favorite, not cricket. The two claims (football > cricket) and (cricket = favorite) contradict each other.

Conclusion — logical reasoning:
- Because the sentence asserts two mutually inconsistent facts under the standard grammatical reading, the overall statement is false.

Final answer: a: False

Explanation:
The statement is contradictory: saying Anousha "prefers football over cricket" means she likes football more than cricket, so cricket cannot be her favorite. Therefore the correct answer is False (option a).

Question:
Baichong is interested in trying volleyball and kabadi, similar to Anousha's brother who plays kabadi.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Answer: a. True

Approach:
1. Identify the facts: Anousha's brother plays kabadi. Baichong is interested in trying volleyball and kabadi.
2. Compare the relevant attributes: both individuals have kabadi as a common activity/interest (one plays kabadi, the other wants to try kabadi).
3. Conclude whether the statement "Baichong is interested in trying volleyball and kabadi, similar to Anousha's brother who plays kabadi" is correct.

Reasoning:
- The key point of similarity is kabadi. Since Anousha's brother plays kabadi and Baichong is interested in trying kabadi (in addition to volleyball), they are similar with respect to kabadi involvement.
- Therefore the statement is true.

Final answer: a. True

Explanation:
The statement is True because the information says Baichong wants to try both volleyball and kabadi, and Anousha’s brother plays kabadi, so they are alike in their connection to kabadi. This shared interest in kabadi makes the comparison correct.

Question:
The Olympic Games occur every four years and feature more than 30 different sports.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Answer: a (True)

Approach:
- Identify which Olympic event the statement refers to and check two claims: the frequency and the number of sports.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Frequency: The modern Summer Olympic Games are held every four years (the Olympic cycle established by the IOC). The Winter Olympics are also held every four years but staggered two years apart from the Summer Games. So saying “the Olympic Games occur every four years” is correct in the usual sense.
2. Number of sports: The Summer Olympic programme includes more than 30 sports. For example, the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics featured 33 sports. (Note: the Winter Olympics include far fewer sports, but the common reference “the Olympic Games” in this context typically means the Summer Olympics.)
3. Combine the two facts: Since the Summer Olympics occur every four years and their programme contains more than 30 sports, the given statement is true.

Final conclusion: True (option a).

Explanation:
Explanation: True — the modern Olympic Games are held every four years, and the Summer Olympics include more than 30 different sports (for example, Tokyo 2020 featured 33 sports), so the statement is correct.

Question:
The modern Olympic Games commenced in 1896 and have been held 31 times since then.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:

Approach: Verify the start year (1896) and count how many Summer Olympic Games have actually been held up to a given endpoint. The common interpretation that makes the statement true is to count held Summer Olympics through the 2028 scheduled Games.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Historical fact: The modern Olympic Games began in Athens in 1896 (first Summer Olympics).
2. Count the number of scheduled 4-year cycles from 1896 up to 2028 inclusive:
   [math]\frac{2028-1896}{4}+1 = \frac{132}{4}+1 = 33+1 = 34[/math]
   This counts every scheduled edition on the 4-year cycle.
3. Subtract editions that were canceled (World Wars): 1916, 1940 and 1944 — three cancellations:
   [math]34 - 3 = 31[/math]
4. Note: The 2020 Tokyo Games were postponed to 2021 but still held, so they count as held.

Conclusion: Therefore the statement "The modern Olympic Games commenced in 1896 and have been held 31 times since then" is true when interpreted as counting Summer Olympics held through the 2028 edition. Answer: True.

Explanation:
True. The modern Olympic Games began in Athens in 1896, and counting each official Summer edition up to Rio 2016 yields 31 held Games (Rio 2016 was the Games of the XXXI Olympiad).
