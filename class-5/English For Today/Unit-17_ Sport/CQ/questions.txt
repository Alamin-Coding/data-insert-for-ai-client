Solution:
Approach — identify which "first Olympic Games" the question refers to (the ancient Olympics) and state the key historical fact about their origin.

Step 1 — Definition and context:
- The phrase “first Olympic Games” refers to the ancient Olympic Games, a series of athletic festivals held in antiquity.

Step 2 — Historical evidence:

Conclusion:
- The first Olympic Games are known for being held in Greece almost 3,000 years ago.

Question:
What are the Olympics known for?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach:
- Identify what the Olympics are and which measurable features determine "biggest" (e.g., number of participating countries and athletes, global audience, range of sports).
- Compare those features with other international sporting events to justify the claim.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Define the Olympics: The Olympic Games are a major international multi-sport event organized under the International Olympic Committee (IOC), with Summer and Winter editions held every four years (staggered).
2. Key measurable features:
   - Participation: The Summer Olympics routinely attract athletes from over 200 National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and the total number of competing athletes is typically in the thousands.
   - Scope of sports: The Games include a large variety of sports and disciplines across many events.
   - Global reach: The Olympics command one of the largest global television and online audiences and wide international media coverage.
3. Evidence (example that adds value): For instance, the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics featured athletes from 206 NOCs and over 11,000 athletes, illustrating the scale of participation and international representation.
4. Logical conclusion: Because the Olympics combine the greatest number of participating countries, a very large number of athletes, a wide range of sports, and global viewership, they are described as the biggest sports competition in the world.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Universality: Olympic movement aims to include as many nations and athletes as possible.
- Multi-sport format: Unlike single-sport world championships, the Olympics aggregate many sports, increasing overall size.
- International governance: The IOC coordinates global participation, standard rules, and the Olympic Charter, enabling the large-scale, recurring event.

Final statement:
- Therefore, the Olympics are known for being the biggest sports competition in the world, based on participation, scope, and global reach.

Explanation:
The Olympics bring together thousands of athletes from almost every country to compete in many different sports, making it the largest international multi-sport event. Because of its scale — number of competitors, range of sports, and worldwide audience — it is known as the biggest sports competition in the world.
