Question:
What polite expression do Sufia and Rashid use when asking for permission in their dialogues?

Options:
a. Can I go out?
b. Could you help me?
c. May I come in?

Question:
How does the mother's request for help differ from Sufia's request for permission?

Options:
a. Mother uses 'Could you please help me?' while Sufia uses 'Can I go out?'
b. Mother asks for help, while Sufia asks for permission to play.
c. Both requests are the same.
d. Sufia does not ask politely, but the mother does.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান: মায়ের অনুরোধ কাজের সহায়তা চাওয়া—উদাহরণ: "আপনি কি আমাকে সাহায্য করবেন?"—এখানে সে সহায়তা চায়, আর সুফিয়ার অনুরোধ ছিল অনুমতির জন্য, যেমন বাইরে যাওয়ার বা খেলাধুলার অনুমতি চাইয়া। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো (b) — মা সাহায্য চাইছেন, সুফিয়া অনুমতি চাইছে। অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ (a) নির্দিষ্ট বাক্যভঙ্গি ধরে নেয় যা প্রশ্নে দেওয়া নেই, (c) দুইটি অনুরোধ একই রকম নয়, আর (d) আচরণগত ভেদাভেদ প্রদর্শন করে না।

Question:
What is a common theme found in the dialogues of Sufia and Rashid compared to Azim and his mother?

Options:
a. Asking for food.
b. Seeking permission or help.
c. Making a craft.
d. Discussing homework.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read both dialogues and identify the main actions—Sufia and Rashid, and Azim and his mother, are both asking someone for permission or help in their exchanges.  
Step 2: Compare this common action to the options: it directly matches "seeking permission or help" (b).  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is b.

Brief why others are wrong: Option a (asking for food) is too specific and not present in both dialogues; c (making a craft) and d (discussing homework) describe different, absent activities.

Question:
In the context of classroom interactions, which phrase is used by Rashid to explain his tardiness?

Options:
a. I was helping my mother.
b. I was at the doctor's chamber.
c. I forgot my homework.
d. I had a late breakfast.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: Rashid’s phrase explaining his tardiness is "I was at the doctor's chamber," which corresponds to option (b). Reasoning: this statement directly gives a plausible external appointment (medical visit) as the cause of being late. Other options are less appropriate—(a) “I was helping my mother” describes a different obligation, (c) “I forgot my homework” explains missing work not arriving late, and (d) “I had a late breakfast” is a routine personal delay rather than a formal excuse. Hence option (b) is the correct choice.

Options:
a. Paper, glue, and feathers.
b. String, paper, scissors, and glue.
c. Paint, canvas, and string.
d. Wood, string, and glue.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the lesson instructions for making birds on strings and note the listed materials: paper for the bird shapes, string to hang them, scissors to cut the paper, and glue to assemble the pieces.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that list: option b ("String, paper, scissors, and glue") exactly matches the required materials.  
Step 3: Explain why the others are incorrect: option a omits scissors, option c uses paint and canvas which are not part of the described craft, and option d uses wood which is unnecessary.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
How does the activity of making birds on strings connect to the theme of following instructions in group work?

Options:
a. It requires teamwork to gather materials.
b. It involves listening to directions and executing them.
c. It encourages individual creativity without instructions.
d. It focuses on discussing the artwork with others.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main skill tested — "following instructions in group work" means paying attention to directions and carrying them out.  
Step 2: Relate it to the activity — making birds on strings typically requires listening to the teacher's sequence (which materials to use, how to fold/cut/tie, order of steps) and then executing those steps, so it directly matches option (b).  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices briefly — (a) mentions teamwork to gather materials which may be secondary, (c) contradicts the idea of following instructions, and (d) focuses on discussion rather than the act of following directions. Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
What action word is likely associated with the activity of making sherbet, based on the context provided?

Options:
a. Mix
b. Cut
c. Draw
d. Tie


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution: To make sherbet you combine ingredients like water, sugar, and flavoring, so the primary action is to mix them. Step 1: Identify the activity — preparing a drink (sherbet) involves combining liquids and solids. Step 2: Choose the verb that best describes combining ingredients — "Mix" fits directly, while "Cut," "Draw," and "Tie" do not describe combining or preparing a beverage. Therefore the correct choice is (a) Mix.

Question:
Which of the following scenarios could require asking permission, similar to Sufia's request?

Options:
a. When you want to borrow a book.
b. When you need help with homework.
c. When you want to eat lunch.
d. When you are playing outside.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the nature of Sufia's request — she asked permission to take or use something.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that pattern: borrowing a book (a) is directly about taking someone’s item, so it normally requires asking permission.  
Step 3: The other options are less similar: needing help with homework (b) is a request for assistance, not permission to take something; eating lunch (c) and playing outside (d) are routine actions that usually don’t require asking permission in the same way.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a).

What is the purpose of groupwork as suggested in the lesson?

Options:
a. To play games during class.
b. To practice dialogues and share ideas.
c. To complete tests together.
d. To create art projects individually.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and identify the main goal of groupwork as described in the lesson — activities that involve students working together to improve learning.
Step 2: Compare the options: a) playing games, b) practicing dialogues and sharing ideas, c) completing tests together, d) creating art projects individually.
Step 3: Choose option b because practicing dialogues and sharing ideas directly fit the collaborative, communicative aims of groupwork (peer practice, discussion, and idea exchange). The other options are incorrect because (a) is mainly recreational, (c) treats assessment rather than collaborative learning, and (d) contradicts the “group” idea by focusing on individual work.

Question:
Comparing the requests from Sufia and Azim, which element makes their requests more polite?

Options:
a. Using 'please' or 'could'.
b. Asking at a specific time.
c. Mentioning their needs clearly.
d. Addressing their parents formally.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what typically makes a request polite — use of polite words or modal verbs such as "please," "could," or "would" shows respect and softens the demand.  
Step 2: Compare options: option (a) points to these exact polite markers, so it directly increases politeness.  
Step 3: Explain why others are less central: asking at a specific time (b) makes the request practical, mentioning needs clearly (c) makes it clear but not necessarily more polite, and addressing parents formally (d) is respectful but not the primary linguistic marker of politeness.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
In what ways do Sufia and Rashid show politeness when making requests, and how does this compare to the expressions used by Azim and his mother when asking for help?

Options:
a. Both pairs use direct commands without polite expressions.
b. Sufia and Rashid use polite requests, while Azim's mother uses a direct question.
c. Both pairs use polite phrasing, but Azim is more direct in asking for help.
d. Sufia asks for permission while Rashid only expresses a need, differing from Azim’s polite help request.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Sufia and Rashid both frame their requests with polite language (phrases like “could you…”, “please”, or asking permission), so their tone is courteous. Azim and his mother also use polite phrasing overall, but Azim himself is slightly more direct when asking for help (a straightforward request rather than a softened permission-seeking form). Therefore option (c) is correct.

Why the others are wrong:
- (a) is wrong because neither pair uses blunt commands.  
- (b) is wrong because Azim’s mother is not purely direct—she uses polite expressions too.  
- (d) is wrong because both Sufia and Rashid use polite requests rather than a strict permission vs. need split.

Question:
Which two types of requests are compared in the dialogues between Sufia and Rashid and between Azim and his mother?

Options:
a. Requests for help and requests for permission
b. Requests for permission and requests for understanding
c. Requests for help and requests for sharing
d. Requests for permission and requests for action


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the type of request in each dialogue — in the Sufia–Rashid dialogue Sufia asks someone to do something for her (a request for help), while in the Azim–mother dialogue Azim asks to be allowed to do something (a request for permission).  
Step 2: Compare the two types found: help vs permission. This matches option a.

Explanation of why other options are incorrect:
- Option b (permission and understanding): one dialogue is help, not seeking understanding.  
- Option c (help and sharing): the second dialogue asks for permission, not for sharing.  
- Option d (permission and action): the pair compared is help and permission, not permission and a general “action.”  

Therefore the correct answer is option a.

Options:
a. If she can eat dessert
b. If she can go out and play
c. If she can watch television
d. If she can go to bed


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and the options to identify what Sufia is asking her mother.  
Step 2: The correct choice is option b — she is asking, "If she can go out and play," which is a typical request a child would make to a parent about leaving the house.  
Step 3: The other options are incorrect because they describe different requests (eating dessert, watching television, going to bed) that do not match the given correct answer. Therefore the answer is option b.

Question:
Rashid was late because his father was __________.

Options:
a. at work
b. ill
c. busy
d. shopping


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে বাক্যটির কারণবোধক সম্পর্ক লক্ষ্য করতে হবে — "Rashid was late because his father was __________." এখানে খালি অংশে এমন একটি শব্দ লাগবে যা রাসheed-এর দেরির কারণ পরিষ্কার করে।  
ধাপ ১: প্রতিটি বিকল্পকে বাক্যে বসিয়ে দেখি — "because his father was ill" সরাসরি কারণে নির্দেশ করে যে পিতার অসুস্থতার কারণে রাসheed দেরি করেছে, এই অর্থবোধ স্পষ্ট।  
ধাপ ২: অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলি তুলনা করলে — "at work" বা "shopping" সাধারণত সন্তানের দেরির সরাসরি কারণ নয় এবং "busy" খুব আপাতত অনির্দিষ্ট; সেই তুলনায় "ill" সবচেয়ে যৌক্তিক। ফলে সঠিক উত্তর হলো খ (ill)।

Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Think about the basic steps to make birds on strings — cut out bird shapes, attach them to string, and secure the pieces.  
Step 2: Identify which tools are required: scissors (to cut), glue (to fix parts) and string (to hang) are essential.  
Step 3: Paint is only for decorating the birds and is optional, not required for making them.  
Therefore the correct answer is d (Paint).

তৃতীয় ধাপ: অতএব বিবৃতি সঠিক, সঠিক উত্তর হল অপশন a (True)। অপশন b (False) ভুল কারণ এটি pairwork-এ সংলাপ অভিনয় হওয়ার বাস্তবতা অস্বীকার করে।

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the function of scissors — they cut materials to shape pieces for the project.  
Step 2: Determine what is needed next to join those cut pieces together; an adhesive (glue) is the natural complement to scissors for assembling parts.  
Step 3: Compare options: paper is a material to cut, paint is for finishing, string can tie but does not join flat pieces as universally as glue. Therefore the correct answer is b: glue.

Question:
Name one expression that Sufia uses to ask for permission.

Options:


Correct Answer: May I go out?

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: বোঝা যে প্রশ্নটি অনুমতি চাইবার জন্য—Sufia wants permission to leave.
Step 2: অনুমতির জন্য সাধারণ ও বিনীত মডাল ক্রিয়া হলো "may"।
Step 3: বাক্য গঠন করে: "May I go out?" — এখানে "May" (অনুমতি), "I" (বিষয়), "go out" (ক্রিয়া+অবস্থান)।
ব্যাখ্যা: "Can I go out?" বেশি অনানুষ্ঠানিক বা সক্ষমতা সম্পর্কে জিজ্ঞাসা করা মনে হতে পারে, আর "Shall I..." প্রস্তাব করার অর্থ দেয়; সুতরাং সম্মানজনকভাবে অনুমতি চাইতে সঠিক উত্তর হলো "May I go out?"

Step 1: Identify what a recipe contains — a list of ingredients, quantities, and step-by-step instructions (imperative verbs like “mix”, “spread”, “toast”) for preparing the food.  
Step 2: Examine the given text for those elements. If the text lacks specific ingredients, measurements, or ordered preparation steps, it does not qualify as a recipe.  
Step 3: Since the correct answer is (b) False, the text must not include the ingredient list or procedural steps needed to make a sandwich. Therefore (a) True is incorrect because it asserts the presence of a recipe that the text does not contain.

Solution: Read the text to pick out the list of materials mentioned for making birds on strings. Step 1: Identify each item explicitly named — a hanger, string, colored paper, scissors, and glue. Step 2: Confirm each item’s purpose (hanger to hang the birds, string to attach them, colored paper to cut bird shapes, scissors to cut, glue to assemble), which shows why all five are necessary. Other options are incorrect if they omit any of these or add unnecessary tools (for example, paint or a sewing needle are not mentioned), so the correct answer is a hanger, string, colored paper, scissors, and glue.

Sufia has completed her homework before asking to play.

Options:

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence carefully—“Sufia has completed her homework before asking to play” indicates two actions: completing homework and asking to play.  
Step 2: Determine the order and tense—the present perfect “has completed” combined with “before” shows the homework was finished prior to asking.  
Step 3: Conclude from the meaning that the statement is true.

Therefore the correct option is a: True. Option b: False is incorrect because it contradicts the explicit time order given in the sentence.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the context: a teacher asking a student usually concerns attendance or behaviour; the common question is about arriving late.
2. Choose the best fit: "why he is late" is a natural and frequent phrase a teacher would use, so option (c) is correct.
3. Why others are less suitable: "happy" and "quiet" could be asked but are less typical in this context, and "early" is unlikely because teachers rarely ask a student why they are early.

সমাধান: প্রশ্নে যে চরিত্রটি বাইরে গিয়ে খেলার অনুমতি চাইছে সেটি সুফিয়া। কারণ সংলাপে সুফিয়া সরাসরি বাইরে খেলতে যাওয়ার অনুরোধ বা “May I go out and play?” ধরনের বাক্য ব্যবহার করে অনুমতি চাইছে, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল সাড়া অনুযায়ী সুফিয়া—উত্তর গ। অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো (রাশিদ, আজীম, Mrs. Alam) ওই অনুমতি চাওয়ার কথাটি বলেনি; Mrs. Alam সাধারণত অনুমতি দানের ভূমিকা রাখতে পারে, তাই তিনি অনুরোধকারী নন।

Question:
Sufia gets permission from her ________ to play.

Options:
a. brother
b. father
c. mother
d. teacher


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution: To fill the blank we identify who a child commonly asks for permission to play. Step 1: The pronoun "her" shows the person is related to Sufia; Step 2: Among the choices, "mother" is the most typical person who gives permission at home. Therefore the correct answer is c: mother. Other options are less suitable—her brother or teacher might allow play sometimes and her father could too, but "mother" is the best and intended choice here.

Question:
Who is late to school in the dialogue?

Options:


Correct Answer: Rashid

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: সংলাপটি মনোযোগ দিয়ে পড়লে দেখা যায় যে রাশিদ নিজেই বা অন্য কেউ স্পষ্টভাবে বলছে যে "রাশিদ স্কুলে দেরি করেছে" বা রাশিদ নিজের থেকেই "আমি স্কুলে দেরি করছি" বলেছে।  
ধাপ ২: সেই সরাসরি বক্তব্য থেকে বোঝা যায় বিলম্বের বিষয়টি রাশিদের সম্পর্কে বলা হচ্ছে।  
ধাপ ৩: অতএব সঠিক উত্তর—রাশিদ; অন্য ব্যক্তিদের সম্পর্কে সংলাপে দেরির কোনো উল্লেখ নেই, তাই তারা ভুল অপশন।

Question:
What action do they perform with the birds on strings?

Options:
a. Make sandwiches
b. Draw pictures
c. Create bird crafts
d. Watch TV


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the phrase "birds on strings" and interpret the most literal and common activity — attaching bird shapes to strings to make decorations.  
Step 2: Match that interpretation to the options: making birds on strings is a hands-on decorative or craft activity, so c "Create bird crafts" fits best.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: a "Make sandwiches" and d "Watch TV" are unrelated activities, and b "Draw pictures" is about drawing on paper rather than assembling birds on strings.  
Conclusion: Correct answer is c.

Step 2: Comparing with the given passage (context of the question) shows that Rashid's father was described as unwell, so the claim contradicts the passage.  
Step 3: Therefore the statement is false, so the correct choice is b. Option a is incorrect because it asserts the opposite of the passage.

Options:

d. markers


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Step 1: দেওয়া উপকরণগুলো (hanger, string, colored paper, scissors) দেখে বোঝা যায় আমরা কাগজ কেটে এবং জোড়া লাগিয়ে পাখি বানাতে যাচ্ছি। Step 2: কাগজের অংশগুলো স্থায়ীভাবে আটকাতে একটি আঠালো পদার্থের দরকার, তাই "glue" সবচেয়ে যুক্তিযুক্ত। ফলে সঠিক উত্তর হলো b। অন্যান্যগুলো অযৌক্তিক কারণ paint বা markers কেবল রঙ দেওয়ার জন্য, tape ব্যবহার করা যায় কিন্তু কাগজের নকশায় সাধারণত glue বেশি পরিষ্কার ও শক্তভাবে ধরে।

Question:
What does Rashid ask for when late to class?

Options:


Correct Answer: Permission to come in

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the situation — a student who arrives late to class typically needs the teacher's approval to enter without disrupting the lesson.  
Step 2: From that context, the natural request is "permission to come in" (to be allowed into the classroom).  
Step 3: Other options (for example asking for extra time, an excuse note, or to repeat missed material) are less immediate and don't match the usual brief request made upon arrival; therefore the correct answer is "Permission to come in."

Options:
a. Finish her homework
b. Clean her room
c. Prepare dinner
d. Wash the car


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Interpret the phrase "before going out" as implying Sufia has a required task she must complete first. Step 2 — Among the choices, finishing her homework (a) is the most typical pre-going-out obligation for a student, so it best fits the phrasing. Step 3 — The other options are less likely: cleaning her room (b) might be optional, preparing dinner (c) and washing the car (d) are tasks usually done at other times or by others, not a standard immediate requirement before going out. Therefore the correct answer is (a) Finish her homework.

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the dialogues and highlight sentences where students ask for assistance (look for question forms or requests).  
2. Identify the objects of those requests: the dialogues include requests like “Can you help me with my homework?” and “Could you carry this for me?” — these clearly show help with homework and with carrying heavy items.  
3. Conclude that the students ask for help with homework or carrying heavy items. Other possible help types (e.g., money, cleaning) are not mentioned in the dialogues, so they are not correct.

Which expression do Sufia and Rashid use to be polite?

Options:
a. Please
b. Can
c. May
d. Could


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Determine the intent — Sufia and Rashid want to ask for permission politely.  
Step 2: Choose the modal that expresses polite permission — "may" is the traditional, most formal modal used to request or grant permission.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others — "please" is a politeness marker (not a modal), "can" asks about ability and is less formal for permission, and "could" is polite but more tentative; among the choices "may" is the most appropriately polite.  
Therefore the correct answer is c: May.

Question:
Birds on strings require only two pieces of string.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
The statement is false. If the claim were true, any arrangement of birds on separate supports could be connected using only two pieces of string, but a simple counterexample shows otherwise: place three birds so that no single continuous string can pass through all three without crossing or breaking (for example, on three widely separated posts). Then you need at least three pieces of string (one for each bird) or an arrangement of more than two pieces to connect them appropriately. Therefore option (b) False is correct; option (a) True is incorrect because two pieces are not sufficient in general.

Question:
The students are asked to act out the ________ from Activity A.

Options:
a. dialogues
b. questions
c. stories
d. instructions


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the phrase "act out" — it commonly means to perform or dramatize spoken exchanges or scenes.  
Step 2: In classroom language activities, students are typically asked to "act out the dialogues" from an activity to practice speaking and role-play.  
Reasoning: "Questions" are for asking/answering, not performing; "stories" can be acted out but the usual classroom prompt is "act out the dialogues"; "instructions" are meant to be followed rather than acted as role-play.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a) dialogues.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the basic parts you must make for a paper bird (body, wings, tail).  
Step 2: Choose a material that lets you form and color those parts — for example, colored paper. Colored paper is needed because you cut shapes from it to make the bird's body and wings and to give the bird its color.  
Step 3: Conclude: one material needed is colored paper (other acceptable materials include string, glue, scissors, or a hanger if you want to hang the bird).

Question:
To ask for help, you could say 'Could you ________ please?'

Options:
a. read this
b. go away
c. stop that
d. look here


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look at the sentence pattern "Could you ______ please?" — after "could you" we expect the base form of a verb to make a polite request.
Step 2: Test each option: "Could you read this please?" is a natural polite way to ask someone to help by reading something, so it fits. The others do not request help: "go away" asks someone to leave, "stop that" asks someone to cease an action, and "look here" is more of a command to direct attention.
Therefore the correct answer is option a: read this.

Question:
What does Sufia ask her mother?

Options:


Correct Answer: Permission to go out and play

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the key sentence in the passage/dialogue where Sufia speaks to her mother — look for a direct request from Sufia.  
Step 2: The line clearly asks for permission to leave the house to play (e.g., “May I go out and play?”), so the correct interpretation is that she is requesting permission to go out and play.  
Reasoning why other choices are wrong: the other options (asking for food, money, or help) are not supported by any wording in the dialogue; they do not match the explicit request Sufia makes. Therefore the correct answer is: Permission to go out and play.

d. রাশিদ শুধু ভদ্রভাবে জিজ্ঞাসা করে


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: প্রশ্নের বিবরণ থেকে দেখা যায় যে সুফিয়া এবং রাশিদ দুজনেই অনুমতি চাচ্ছে, কিন্তু তারা ভিন্ন ব্যক্তিকে ভিন্ন ভদ্র ভাষায় সম্বোধন করছে — সুফিয়া মাকে উদ্দেশ্য করে বলছে এবং রাশিদ শিক্ষককে উদ্দেশ্য করে বলছে।

Step 1: পরিস্থিতির বিশ্লেষণ — সুফিয়া যখন তার মায়ের কাছে সাহায্য চাইছে, তার উদ্দেশ্য অন্যের কাছে অনুরোধ করা, কোনো আদেশ বা কেঁদে ভিক্ষা নয়।

ধাপ ২: পাঠ্য থেকে যদি দেখা যায় তারা সম্মানজনক ভাষা ব্যবহার করে এবং সঠিকভাবে অনুরোধ করে, তখন সঠিক উত্তর হবে b (ভদ্রভাবে এবং সঠিকভাবে)।  
কারণ: ভদ্র ও সঠিকভাবে অনুরোধ করা মানে তারা স্পষ্টভাবে, শিষ্টাচার বজায় রেখে দাবি বা অনুরোধ জানায়, যা সরাসরি প্রশ্নের সাথে মিলে।  
অন্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কেন: a (শুধু হ্যাঁ বা না বলে) অতিমাত্রায় সীমিত এবং অনুরোধের ভঙ্গিমা ব্যক্ত করে না; c (কখনো কখনো বিরক্তিকরভাবে) ও d (শুধু অশালীনভাবে) নেতিবাচক এবং পাঠের বর্ণনার সঙ্গে সঙ্গতিপূর্ণ নয়।
