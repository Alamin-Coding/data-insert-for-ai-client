Question:
How do people typically ask for permission in dialogues from the chapters?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Identify the speaker’s intention (to enter, to use something, to ask for help).
- Choose an appropriate polite structure (modal verbs, indirect questions, softeners).
- Adjust formality and add polite words like "please" or introductory phrases such as "Would you mind…?".

Essential steps (working steps):
1. Recognize the action needing permission (e.g., entering a room, borrowing an item, asking for assistance).
2. Select a polite modal or phrase:
   - For asking permission to do something yourself: use "May I…?", "Could I…?", "Can I…?" or "Would you mind if I…?"
   - For requesting someone’s help or action: use "Could you…?", "Would you please…?", "Would you mind…?"
3. Soften the request when needed by adding "please", or by making it indirect ("I was wondering if I could…", "Would you mind helping me with…").
4. Use appropriate tone and politeness markers depending on context (formal: "May I come in?" / informal: "Can I come in?").

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Modal verbs convey degree of politeness: "May" and "Could" are more polite/formal than "Can".
- Indirect questions and hedging (e.g., "I was wondering if…", "Would you mind…") increase politeness and reduce imposition.
- Adding "please" or using conditional forms ("Would you…") further softens the request.
- Context matters: choose more formal language with strangers, elders, or officials; informal phrasing with friends or peers.

Examples (concise and illustrative):
- Direct, polite permission to enter: "May I come in?" (formal) or "Can I come in?" (informal).
- Polite request for help: "Could you please help me?" or "Would you mind helping me with this?"

Logical reasoning:
- Asking permission aims to respect the other person’s authority or comfort; using modals and softeners signals respect and reduces the chance of refusal or offense.
- The choice between forms depends on speaker’s relationship with the listener and how much politeness is required.

Final answer (concise): People typically ask for permission by using polite modal expressions and softened question forms such as "May I come in?" or "Could you please help me?"

Explanation:
Explanation: The answer is correct because people in dialogues use polite modal verbs and polite words (like "may," "could," and "please") to ask permission or request help. Phrases such as "May I come in?" and "Could you please help me?" are common examples showing these polite structures.

Question:
What did Rashid's absence from school relate to?

Options:


Correct Answer: His father's illness.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — Read the sentence(s) or passage that mention Rashid’s absence and identify the cause; in comprehension tasks the cause is usually stated explicitly or implied by nearby phrases.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Locate the sentence(s) referring to Rashid’s absence from school.
2. Find the clause that explains why he was absent (look for words like “because,” “due to,” or mentions of illness, family, or emergency).
3. The passage states that his father was ill, which directly gives the reason for Rashid missing school.
4. Therefore, by explicit statement in the text, Rashid’s absence is related to his father’s illness.

Relevant concept:
- Cause-and-effect in reading comprehension: identify the effect (Rashid’s absence) and the stated cause (his father’s illness).

Final answer:
Rashid was absent from school because his father was ill.

Explanation:
Explanation: The passage indicates Rashid did not attend school because his father was ill, so his absence was directly caused by that family emergency. This is a cause-and-effect relationship: a parent's sickness can require a child to stay home, which explains why he missed school.
