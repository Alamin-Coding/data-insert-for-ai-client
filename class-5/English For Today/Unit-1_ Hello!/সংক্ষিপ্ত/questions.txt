Question:
How do Sima’s reasons for talking with Jessica at the station differ from her reasons for talking with Andy at the Language Club?

Options:


Correct Answer: With Jessica she offers greetings and wishes for a short travel meeting because Jessica is going on holiday; with Andy she introduces a friend and aims to practise English and form a longer acquaintance.

Solution:


Explanation:
Sima talks to Jessica at the station mainly to offer greetings and good wishes for a short, one-off meeting because Jessica is leaving for holiday. In contrast, with Andy at the Language Club she aims to introduce a friend, practise English and build a longer acquaintance, so the interaction is more about ongoing communication and language practice.

Question:
What is the main lesson from the story of The Hare and the Tortoise?

Options:


Correct Answer: Slow but steady wins the race.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach:
State the moral clearly, then support it by summarizing the key events of the story and drawing the general principle from those events. Show how the characters’ traits lead to the outcome, and give a brief real-life application.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Summary of relevant events:
   - The Hare is fast but overconfident and stops to rest (or becomes distracted) during the race.
   - The Tortoise moves slowly but keeps going without stopping.
   - Because the Tortoise persists and the Hare wastes time, the Tortoise wins.

2. Identify the core concepts:
   - Consistency/persistence: continuing effort over time.
   - Overconfidence and complacency: assuming success and reducing effort.
   - Time management and steady progress: small, regular gains accumulate.

3. Logical connection:
   - Speed alone does not guarantee success if it is paired with inconsistency or interruption.
   - Continuous, steady effort reduces the chance of losing progress and can overcome an initial disadvantage.
   - Therefore, a slow but consistent approach can outperform a faster yet erratic one.

Relevant example (brief, adds value):
- In studying: a student who studies a little each day consistently will usually perform better than one who crams at random intervals and skips study sessions.

Conclusion:
The main lesson is: “Slow but steady wins the race” — persistence and consistent effort lead to success more reliably than speed combined with carelessness or overconfidence.

Explanation:
The story shows that consistent, steady effort and persistence lead to success even if you are slower, because they beat careless overconfidence and irregular bursts of speed. The hare’s overconfidence and pauses let the tortoise’s steady pace win, teaching that reliability and perseverance matter more than short-term speed.

Question:
Who is the fastest animal in the forest?

Options:


Correct Answer: The hare

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — first decide what “fastest” means (here: highest running speed on the ground), then compare the common forest animals by their adaptations for speed.

Step 1 — criterion:
- We take “fastest” to mean the maximum sprinting speed an animal can achieve on land in the forest environment.

Step 2 — consider likely candidates:
- Common forest mammals include the hare, deer, fox, boar, and various rodents. Birds of prey can dive faster but are not comparable as ground runners.

Step 3 — compare traits and performance:
- The hare has long, powerful hind legs, a flexible spine and lightweight body built for rapid acceleration and sustained high-speed sprints, often using zigzag runs to evade predators.
- Deer and foxes are fast too, but their body plans favor endurance or stealth plus bursts of speed; in most forests the hare’s sprinting ability outmatches them.
- (For context) hares commonly reach top speeds on the order of several tens of km/h, typically faster than the average fox or wild boar in a short sprint. The cheetah is the fastest land animal overall but is not a typical forest-dweller.

Conclusion:
- The hare is the fastest animal in the forest because its morphology and sprinting performance give it the highest short-term running speed among typical forest species.

Explanation:
The hare is the fastest because its long, powerful hind legs, lightweight body, and strong muscles let it run and accelerate quickly to escape predators. This shows how physical adaptations determine an animal’s speed in the forest.

Question:
What did the tortoise propose to the hare?

Options:


Correct Answer: To have a race

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Recognize the context: in Aesop’s fable "The Tortoise and the Hare" the tortoise speaks to the hare and makes a specific proposal.

Essential answer — The tortoise proposed that they have a race.

Working steps and logical reasoning:
1. Observation: The hare boasts about being much faster than the tortoise.
2. Proposal: To challenge the boast and prove a point, the tortoise suggests a race between them along a set course.
3. Purpose and principle: The tortoise’s proposal is meant to test speed versus perseverance — showing that steady, consistent effort can beat overconfidence and carelessness.
4. Outcome (briefly relevant): By accepting the race and then resting, the overconfident hare loses, which illustrates the moral behind the tortoise’s proposal.

Relevant concept: The proposal exemplifies a test of ability and character (humility, persistence) rather than merely a contest of raw speed.

Explanation:
The tortoise proposed having a race to challenge the hare’s boasting about being fastest and to prove that steady effort could win. This proposal is the central action that leads to the story’s lesson that patience and consistency can beat overconfidence and haste.

Question:
What did the hare do while the tortoise was racing?

Options:


Correct Answer: He took a nap.

Solution:
সমাধান:

উত্তর: খরগোশটি বিশ্রাম নিল — সে এক ধুমধাম করে ঘুমিয়ে পড়ে (He took a nap).

উত্তর প্রদানের ধারা ও যুক্তি:
1. প্রশ্ন বিশ্লেষণ: প্রশ্নটি ক্লাসিক উপকথা "The Tortoise and the Hare" থেকে নেওয়া — এখানে প্রধান ঘটনাটি হলো দৌড় প্রতিযোগিতার সময় খরগোশ কী করেছিল।
2. মূল ঘটনার চিহ্নায়ন: কাহিনীতে খরগোশ তার গতি নিয়ে আত্মতুষ্ট ছিল এবং ভাবলো ধীরগতির কচ্ছপ তাকে ধরতে পারবে না; তাই সে বিরতি নিয়ে ঘুমিয়ে পড়ে।
3. ফলাফলগত যুক্তি: খরগোশ ঘুমানোর ফলে কচ্ছপ অবিরত ও ধীরগতিতে এগিয়ে গিয়ে প্রতিযোগিতা জেতে। এই ঘটনাটি দেখায় যে আত্মতুষ্টি ও অলসতা অসুবিধা সৃষ্টি করতে পারে, এবং ধারাবাহিক পরিশ্রমের মূল্য বোঝায়।

প্রাসঙ্গিক ধারণা:
- আত্মতুষ্টি vs ধারাবাহিক প্রচেষ্টা: দ্রুতগতির আত্মবিশ্বাস থাকলেও যদি সতত কাজ না করা হয়, তবে ধৈর্যশীল ও স্থির প্রচেষ্টা জয়ের দিকে নিয়ে যেতে পারে।
- ফলাফল থেকে শিক্ষা: পরিকল্পিত বিশ্রাম করা আলাদা, কিন্তু কাজ চলাকালীন অলস বিশ্রাম নেয়া ক্ষতিকর হতে পারে।

Explanation:
The hare grew overconfident about his speed and stopped to take a nap while the tortoise kept moving steadily. Because of that pause, the hare lost the race, illustrating that steady effort beats careless confidence.

Options:


Correct Answer: They plan to introduce themselves to Andy and share a common interest in practicing English.

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
Identify the actions Sima and Tamal will take to practice English with Andy and state the shared interest that motivates those actions.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Introduction step — Sima and Tamal plan to introduce themselves to Andy so they can begin a conversation. A clear self-introduction establishes rapport and opens the opportunity to request practice.
2. Request and arrangement — After introducing themselves, they will express their desire to practice English with him and arrange how and when to do it (e.g., informal chats, regular practice sessions, topic-based conversation).
3. Practice methods — Their plan likely includes speaking together with Andy, exchanging feedback, and using everyday conversation to improve fluency and confidence. This is a common, effective approach for language practice because real conversation builds listening and speaking skills.
4. Mutual benefit — Because Andy also wants to practice English, all three have the same goal; this shared interest makes collaboration natural and sustainable.

Final answer:
They plan to introduce themselves to Andy and arrange to practice English together (through conversation and scheduled practice), and they share with him the common interest of practicing English.

Explanation:
They plan to introduce themselves to Andy so they can start practising English with him; introducing themselves opens a conversation and creates opportunity for practice. They share the common interest of practising English, which explains their intent to meet and talk with Andy.

Question:
What is the relationship between Sima and Jessica?

Options:


Correct Answer: They met while traveling.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach: Identify the type of connection described and use the given phrase to infer the relationship origin.

Working steps:
1. Consider common relationship categories: family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, acquaintances, etc.
2. The phrase “met while traveling” specifies how the two people first encountered each other — it describes the origin of their relationship rather than a familial or professional tie.
3. Therefore the appropriate characterization is that Sima and Jessica met during travel, i.e., they became acquaintances (or friends) through traveling.

Relevant concept:
- “Met while traveling” denotes the circumstance of first meeting and implies an acquaintance/friendship formed in the course of travel, not a familial or workplace relationship.

Conclusion:

Question:
What does Andy Smith do in Bangladesh?

Options:


Correct Answer: He works with an NGO.

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — To answer "What does Andy Smith do in Bangladesh?" identify the verb phrase that describes his activity or occupation in the sentence or passage, and use the contextual location "in Bangladesh" to confirm where the activity takes place.

Steps and working:
1. Identify subject and predicate: the subject is "Andy Smith" and the predicate asks "does ... do" meaning his job or role.
2. Look for the clause that states his occupation or activity linked to the location "in Bangladesh."
3. Extract the occupational information: the text indicates he is associated with an NGO (a non-governmental organization).

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Question words like "what" ask for a thing, here an occupation or role.
- The prepositional phrase "in Bangladesh" specifies the place where the activity occurs but does not change the occupation itself.
- "Works with an NGO" denotes employment or collaboration with a non-governmental organization.

Logical reasoning:
Since the sentence explicitly states his role and links it to Bangladesh by location, the correct, direct answer to the question about what he does there is his occupation with the NGO.

Final answer:
He works with an NGO.

Explanation:
The correct answer is "He works with an NGO" because the passage states that Andy Smith is employed by a non-governmental organization in Bangladesh. To arrive at this answer, look for explicit phrases about a person’s role (like "works with" or "works for") and the term "NGO," which together identify his occupation.
