Question:
What similarity is shared between Sima's and Tamal's responses when meeting someone new compared to the introduction etiquette in the Language Club?

Options:
a. Both groups emphasize polite introductions and inviting conversations.
b. Sima and Tamal are less formal than the Language Club members.
c. Both groups neglect to use titles when introducing themselves.
d. Sima and Tamal do not practice English during their introductions.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the common behavior — both Sima and Tamal, when meeting someone new, use polite greetings and open the conversation (for example, introducing themselves and showing interest in continuing the talk).  
Step 2: Compare this to the Language Club etiquette, which emphasizes polite introductions and inviting conversation. Since both Sima and Tamal follow the same polite, inviting approach, option a is correct.  
Why the others are incorrect: option b is wrong because Sima and Tamal are not described as more casual than the Club; option c is wrong because neither group is said to neglect titles deliberately; option d is wrong because the issue is about manners of introduction, not about practicing English.

Question:
Why is Jessica going to Chattogram?

Options:
a. For business
b. To visit friends
c. On holiday with her father
d. To study


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the sentence in the text that states Jessica’s purpose for going to Chattogram — it explicitly says she is "on holiday with her father."  
Step 2: Match that statement to the choices: this corresponds exactly to option (c).  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: (a) for business, (b) to visit friends, and (d) to study are not supported by the text. Therefore the correct answer is (c) on holiday with her father.

Question:
Who is the new person that Sima and Tamal meet?

Options:
a. Andy Smith
b. Jessica
c. A teacher
d. A stranger


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: Read the question and compare the options with what the passage (or prompt) states about the new person Sima and Tamal meet. The prompt identifies the new person by name, which matches option a, Andy Smith. 

Reasoning: Option a is a specific personal name that directly answers "who" they meet. Options b (Jessica) is a different name, option c (a teacher) describes a role not the name, and option d (a stranger) is a generic descriptor—none of these match the named person given. Therefore the correct answer is a: Andy Smith.

Options:
a. Bangladesh
b. England
c. Animals
d. History


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: From the given question we identify the subject of Andy's reading directly — he reads about Bangladesh. Therefore the correct choice is (a) Bangladesh. The other options are incorrect because there is no information indicating he reads about England, animals, or history, so (b), (c), and (d) do not match the stated fact.

Question:
How can Sima and Tamal practice their English with Andy?

Options:
a. By ignoring him
b. By asking questions
c. By watching DVDs
d. By reading silently


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — Sima and Tamal need to practice English with Andy, which requires interaction and use of spoken language.  
Step 2: Evaluate options — "By asking questions" (b) involves direct conversation with Andy, giving immediate practice and feedback. The other choices are incorrect because ignoring him gives no practice, watching DVDs is passive and not specific to Andy, and reading silently does not involve speaking with Andy.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
Why is it important to practice speaking English in the Language Club?

Options:
a. To learn about history
b. To improve communication skills
c. To memorize vocabulary
d. To write essays


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main purpose of practicing speaking in a language club — it helps learners use language actively rather than just learning facts.  
Step 2: Reasoning — regular speaking practice improves fluency, pronunciation, confidence, and real-time interaction skills, which are all aspects of communication.  
Step 3: Evaluate options: option (b) correctly matches this purpose. Options (a) and (d) are about history and writing, which are unrelated to speaking practice, and option (c) (memorizing vocabulary) is a narrower activity that supports speaking but is not the primary goal. Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
What does Sima say before leaving?

Options:
a. Safe travels
b. Have a good journey
c. Goodbye
d. See you later


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: Read the question and compare the meanings of the options. Step 1: "Have a good journey" (option b) is the conventional phrase one says to someone who is about to depart on a trip. Step 2: "Safe travels" (a) is similar in intent but slightly different wording; "Goodbye" (c) is a general farewell without the travel-specific wish; "See you later" (d) implies a planned future meeting. Therefore the best choice is option b because it directly expresses a wish for a good journey.

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution: Read the Town Hall Language Club announcement or roster and look for who is explicitly labeled or described as the "new" member. The announcement identifies Andy Smith as the new person, so the correct answer is option c (Andy Smith). The other names — Tamal, Sima, and Jessica — are listed as existing members (not marked new), so options a, b, and d are incorrect.

Options:
a. To borrow a book
b. To practice speaking English
c. To ask about NGOs
d. To learn about Chattogram


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Sima’s stated purpose from the dialogue or question context — she says she wants to improve or practise her spoken English with Andy.
Step 2: Match this purpose to the options: option (b) “To practice speaking English” directly matches her stated goal.
Step 3: Eliminate other options because they do not match the stated reason: (a) borrowing a book, (c) asking about NGOs, and (d) learning about Chattogram are unrelated to practising spoken English.

Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Compare the reasons for Sima and Jessica's journeys. How are they similar or different?

Options:
a. Both are going on holiday
b. Sima is visiting family; Jessica is on vacation
c. Jessica is on a school trip; Sima is exploring
d. They both are going to practice English


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify each person's purpose — both Sima and Jessica are described as travelling for leisure/holiday, so their reasons match as going on holiday.  
Step 2: Compare with options: a correctly states both are going on holiday.  
Step 3: Eliminate others: b is wrong because it claims Sima visits family while Jessica is on vacation (different reasons); c is wrong because Jessica is not on a school trip; d is wrong because neither is travelling specifically to practice English.  

Therefore the correct answer is a.

Question:
What motivates Sima and Tamal to meet Andy at the Town Hall Language Club?

Options:
a. They want to ask him about his NGO work.
b. They are interested in practicing English with him.
c. They want to invite him to Chattogram.
d. They are looking for a new book to read.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Identify context — the meeting place is the Town Hall Language Club, which signals a focus on language practice rather than NGO activities or travel plans.  
Step 2: Infer motive — because the club is for language learning, the most direct reason for Sima and Tamal to meet Andy there is to practice English with him.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options — (a) asking about his NGO work and (c) inviting him to Chattogram are unrelated to a language club setting, and (d) looking for a new book is not specific to meeting someone at a language club.  
Conclusion: therefore option b is correct.

Question:
What can be inferred about the purpose of Sima and Tamal visiting the Town Hall Language Club compared to Jessica's trip to Chattogram?

Options:
a. Sima and Tamal are there to relax, while Jessica is going for a holiday with her father.
b. Sima and Tamal want to practice their English, whereas Jessica is traveling for leisure.
c. Sima and Tamal are meeting new friends, while Jessica is visiting family.
d. Sima and Tamal are reading books, while Jessica is participating in a club activity.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify each trip’s purpose from the text — Sima and Tamal visit the Town Hall Language Club to use the club’s facilities and improve their English, while Jessica’s trip to Chattogram is described as a leisure visit with her father.  
Step 2: Match these purposes to the options: option b states Sima and Tamal want to practice their English and Jessica is traveling for leisure, which directly fits the descriptions.  
Why other options are wrong: option a wrongly says Sima and Tamal are there to relax; option c incorrectly claims Jessica is visiting family; option d misstates that Sima and Tamal are reading books and Jessica is in a club activity. Therefore the correct answer is b.

What is the primary purpose of Sima and Tamal visiting the Town Hall Language Club?

Options:
a. To meet a new friend
b. To practise speaking English
c. To read books about Bangladesh
d. To take a train to Chattogram


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Identify the context — "Town Hall Language Club" implies a place focused on languages and conversation practice.  
Step 2: Match the context with the options: option (b) "To practise speaking English" directly fits the purpose of a language club.  
Step 3: Conclude that (b) is correct.

Why other options are incorrect: (a) meeting a new friend might happen but is not the primary purpose; (c) reading books about Bangladesh is unrelated to a language club's main activity; (d) taking a train to Chattogram is not relevant to visiting a language club.

Question:
How does Sima feel about meeting Jessica for the first time?

Options:
a. Indifferent
b. Excited
c. Nervous
d. Annoyed


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for words or phrases in the text that describe Sima’s reaction to meeting Jessica (for example: “eager,” “thrilled,” “couldn’t wait,” smiling, jumping, etc.).  
Step 2: Match those clues to the options. Words indicating positive anticipation correspond to "Excited" rather than "Indifferent," "Nervous," or "Annoyed."  
Step 3: Conclude that Sima feels excited because the text shows eager, positive anticipation.  

Explanation of incorrect options:
- Indifferent is wrong because neutral or no-reaction language would be used if that were true.  
- Nervous is wrong because anxiety-related words (e.g., worried, tense) are absent.  
- Annoyed is wrong because irritation or frustration is not described.  

Therefore the correct answer is b: Excited.

What did Sima and Tamal plan to do with Andy Smith in the Language Club?

Options:
a. Practice their English
b. Attend a lecture
c. Discuss books
d. Travel to Chattogram


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the context "Language Club" and meeting "with Andy Smith," the most natural purpose is practicing language skills, i.e., practicing English.  
Step 2: Compare options: a matches this intent directly; b (attend a lecture) and c (discuss books) are possible activities but are not specifically indicated; d (travel to Chattogram) is unrelated to a club meeting.  
Therefore the correct answer is a: Practice their English.

Options:

Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Examine the available information — there is no indication in the question of any prior relationship (no shared workplace, family ties, or school connection) between Sima and Jessica.
Step 2: Compare the options — a, b, and c each assert a specific prior relationship that the question does not provide evidence for.
Therefore the correct choice is d: they are strangers who just met. Other options are incorrect because they require factual evidence of a co-worker, family, or classmate relationship which is not present.

Question:
What is a key expression Sima uses to start a conversation?

Options:
a. How do you do?
b. May I introduce myself?
c. Nice meeting you
d. What is your name?


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: To start a conversation politely, one typically uses a phrase that offers an introduction. Among the choices, "May I introduce myself?" is explicitly an opening formula used to begin speaking and offer one's name, so option (b) is correct. The others are less appropriate as openers: "How do you do?" is a formal greeting, "Nice meeting you" is said after an introduction, and "What is your name?" is a direct question rather than a polite way to begin.

Options:
a. Yes, I am.
b. No, I'm from Sylhet.
c. No, I’m from the UK.
d. I’m not sure.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Step-by-step: the response begins with "No," which rules out (a) "Yes, I am."; it specifies "from Sylhet," which matches (b) and contradicts (c) "from the UK"; (d) is wrong because she is certain, not unsure.

Question:
When is Sima's train scheduled to leave?

Options:
a. In an hour
b. In 10 minutes
c. Later in the afternoon
d. The next day


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Locate the sentence in the text that states the departure time; it explicitly says the train will leave "in 10 minutes."  
Step 2: Match that phrase to the choices — option b ("In 10 minutes") exactly matches the stated schedule.  
Therefore the correct answer is b. Options a, c, and d are incorrect because they conflict with the explicit "in 10 minutes" departure time (they suggest a later time or a different day).

Explanation of other options: online courses (a) and mobile apps (c) are not mentioned, and "books only" (d) is wrong because they use audiovisual resources in addition to any books.

d. For a school project


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the explicit reason given in the prompt or passage — it states Jessica is travelling with her father for leisure.  
Step 2: Match that reason to the options: the phrase “with her father” and “on holiday” corresponds exactly to option c.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: a (business trip) implies work, b (to visit friends) implies friends are the purpose, and d (school project) implies academic work — none mention her father or holiday.  
Therefore the correct answer is c (On holiday with her father).

What is the main purpose of Sima and Tamal's visit to the Town Hall Language Club?

Options:
a. To watch DVDs
b. To practice speaking English
c. To read books
d. To play games


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize that "Town Hall Language Club" indicates a place focused on languages and practicing communication skills.  
Step 2: From that context, the most logical purpose of Sima and Tamal's visit is to practice speaking English.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options: watching DVDs, reading books, or playing games are activities not central to a language club's main goal. Therefore the correct answer is (b) To practice speaking English.

What can Sima and Tamal do to improve their English?

Options:
a. Watch movies without subtitles
b. Practice speaking with Andy
c. Read only Bangla books
d. Avoid English conversations


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: To improve spoken English the most effective method is active practice and feedback, so option b (Practice speaking with Andy) is best because speaking with a partner builds fluency, pronunciation and confidence.  
Step 2: The other options are less effective: option a (watch movies without subtitles) helps listening but not active speaking; option c (read only Bangla books) offers no English practice; option d (avoid English conversations) hinders improvement.  
Therefore the correct answer is: b.

Question:
Predict what might happen if Sima and Tamal do not practice speaking English regularly.

Options:
a. They will become fluent quickly
b. They will struggle to communicate
c. They will learn more vocabulary
d. They will forget their native language


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the cause and effect — speaking ability requires regular practice to maintain fluency and confidence.  
Step 2: Compare options against that reasoning — without regular speaking practice, their spoken proficiency and confidence will decline.  
Step 3: Choose b because "They will struggle to communicate" directly follows from reduced practice; the other options are unlikely: (a) contradicts the need for practice, (c) learning more vocabulary usually requires study or exposure, and (d) forgetting their native language is not a plausible outcome of not practicing English.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the key intention described — Sima's purpose in meeting the new person is to get language practice (the context indicates she wants to improve her English).  
Step 2: Match that intention to the options: option (b) "To practice English" directly matches the stated purpose.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: (a) "To greet him" is too general, (c) "To ask for directions" and (d) "To show her book" don’t relate to language practice. Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
If Sima's train leaves in 10 minutes, what should she do next?

Options:
a. Buy a ticket
b. Find her seat
c. Call her friend
d. Say goodbye to Jessica


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the situation — Sima's train will depart very soon (in 10 minutes), so she has only a short time for a final action.  
Step 2: Choose the most appropriate last-minute action — saying goodbye to Jessica is a quick, sensible final step before boarding, so d is correct.  
Step 3: Why the others are less appropriate — buying a ticket or finding her seat are actions that should already be done well before the last 10 minutes, and calling a friend is unnecessary if she needs to leave immediately.

Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:

Step 1: Determine the goal — "practice their English with Andy" implies active use of language (speaking and interactive exchange). 
Step 2: Compare options: "By chatting" directly involves conversational practice, so it matches the goal. 
Step 3: Reject others briefly — reading books together helps reading, "introducing themselves" is only a short exchange, and "watching DVDs" is mostly passive listening/viewing. 
Therefore the correct choice is d: By chatting.

Options:
a. Both Sima and Mamun introduce their friends in a formal setting.
b. Sima engages with English practice while Mamun highlights famous individuals from his district.
c. Mamun talks about his district's geography, while Sima discusses language skills.
d. Both Sima and Mamun mention historical landmarks in their conversations.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify each person's focus: Sima’s interactions in the Town Hall Language Club are about practising English and conversational language skills, while Mamun’s description of his home district centres on notable or famous individuals from that district.  
Step 2 — Compare topics directly: Sima = language practice; Mamun = famous people. These are distinct but complementary activities, so the option that states this contrast is correct.  
Step 3 — Select and justify: therefore option b is correct because it accurately states that Sima engages with English practice while Mamun highlights famous individuals from his district.  
Why the others are wrong: option a is wrong because Mamun is not introducing friends in a formal setting; option c is wrong because Mamun is not focused on geography; option d is wrong because neither primarily discusses historical landmarks.

Step 2: c is correct because working with an NGO often involves using English (international communication, reports, or meetings), so Andy likely has practical English experience and opportunities to practice with Sima.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options: a being a famous writer or b being a good singer does not necessarily mean he can help with spoken English practice, and d knowing many languages doesn’t guarantee strong English skills. Therefore the best choice is c.

Question:
What is the name of Mamun's home district?

Options:
a. Dhaka
b. Kishoreganj
c. Sylhet
d. Chattogram


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে প্রশ্নে দেওয়া বিকল্পগুলো যাচাই করতে হবে। পর্যবেক্ষণে দেখা যাচ্ছে বিকল্প b হচ্ছে "Kishoreganj", যা Mamun-এর বাড়ি জেলা হিসেবে দেওয়া হয়েছে, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো বিকল্প b। অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো (Dhaka, Sylhet, Chattogram) এই প্রশ্নে উল্লেখিত Mamun-এর জেলা নয়, সেগুলো ভুল।

How far is Kishoreganj from Dhaka?

Options:
a. 100 kilometers
b. 150 kilometers
c. 145 kilometers
d. 200 kilometers


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: সাধারণভাবে মানচিত্রীয় বা রোড-দূরত্ব সূত্র (যেমন Google Maps) অনুযায়ী ঢাকা থেকে কিশোরগঞ্জ পর্যন্ত দূরত্ব হলো [math]145\ \text{kilোমিটার}[/math]।  
Step 2: দেওয়া বিকল্পগুলোর মধ্যে গ (c) — [math]145\ \text{কিমি}[/math] এই মাপের সাথে মিলে যায়, তাই এটি সঠিক উত্তর।  
বাকি বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ তারা সঠিক দূরত্ব থেকে আলাদা: [math]|145-100|=45\ \text{কিমি}[/math], [math]|150-145|=5\ \text{কিমি}[/math], এবং [math]|200-145|=55\ \text{কিমি}[/math]।

Question:
What river flows through Kishoreganj?

Options:
a. Ganges
b. Jamuna
c. Narasunda
d. Padma


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the location — Kishoreganj is a district in central Bangladesh.  
Step 2: Determine the local rivers — the main river that flows through Kishoreganj town and district is the Narasunda.  
Step 3: Choose the option matching that river. Therefore option c (Narasunda) is correct.  

Briefly why others are incorrect: the Jamuna and Padma are major rivers in Bangladesh but do not flow through Kishoreganj, and the Ganges (Padma) likewise does not pass through the district.

Options:
a. Syed Nazrul Islam
b. Chandrabati
c. Zainul Abedin
d. Sukumar Roy


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: প্রশ্নে প্রতিটি ব্যক্তির পরিচয় বিবেচনা করা হলো — কিশোরগঞ্জের সঙ্গে কোন নামটি বিশেষভাবে জড়িত তা খুঁজতে হবে।  
Step 2: খ চন্দ্রাবতী (চন্দ্রাবতী) কিশোরগঞ্জের একজন প্রতিষ্টিত মধ্যযুগীয় কাব্যমহিলা, তিনি কিশোরগঞ্জের লোককথা ও সাহিত্যের সঙ্গে পরিচিত। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো খ।  
সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলি ভুল কারণ: ক সইদ নাজরুল ইসলাম একজন জাতীয় রাজনৈতিক নেতা, গ জায়নুল আবেদীন একজন খ্যাতনামা চিত্রশিল্পী, এবং ঘ সুকুমার রায় পশ্চিমবঙ্গের সাহিত্যের সঙ্গে বেশি পরিচিত — এরা কিশোরগঞ্জের প্রতিস্হিত সন্ধানযোগ্য ব্যক্তি হিসেবে নয়।

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize landmarks associated with Kishoreganj — the Solakia Eid Ground (Solakia Eidgah) is a famous and historically notable landmark located in Kishoreganj.  
Step 2: Eliminate the other choices — Lalbagh Fort and Ahsan Manzil are historic sites in Dhaka, and Jatiyo Sangsad Bhaban (the National Parliament) is also in Dhaka, so they are not landmarks of Kishoreganj.

Options:
a. Because it is large
b. Because of its cultural heritage
c. Because of its climate
d. Because it has many shopping centers


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্ন ও বিকল্পগুলো পড়ে দেখা—"Mamun loves his home district" থেকে ব্যক্তিগত অনুভূতিই জানানো হয়েছে।  
ধাপ ২: প্রেম বা আবেগ সাধারণত সাংস্কৃতিক ঐতিহ্য, স্মৃতি বা পরিচয়ের কারণেই হয়ে থাকে, তাই সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত বিকল্পটি হলো খ (সাংস্কৃতিক ঐতিহ্যের জন্য)।  
কারণ অন্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল — ক (বড় হওয়া) একটি নিরপেক্ষ বৈশিষ্ট্য, গ (জলবায়ু) এবং ঘ (বহুতর শপিং সেন্টার) আরও বাস্তবিক বা সুবিধাজনিত কারণ, যা সাধারণত 'ভালবাসা' ব্যাখ্যা করতে সবচেয়ে নির্ভরযোগ্য নয়। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে খ.

c. উভয়ের ইংরেজি ভাষায় চর্চার প্রয়োজন
d. সিমার ট্রেনের সময় এবং জেসিকার ছুটির সময়


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: কথোপকথনের মূল-বিশদ দেখলে জানা যায় যে জেসিকা তার বাড়ির শহর এবং সে তার বাবার সাথে ভ্রমণের কথা বলেছে—এটি ব্যক্তিগত পরিচয় ও ব্যাকগ্রাউন্ড সম্পর্কিত তথ্য, তাই সেটা পরিচয় বিনিময়ের সঙ্গে সরাসরি সম্পর্কিত।  
ধাপ ২: তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল খ (জেসিকার বাড়ির শহর এবং তার বাবার সাথে ভ্রমণ)।  
অন্য বিকল্পগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: ক সিমার ভ্রমণের উদ্দেশ্য/স্থান কথোপকথনের মূল নয়, গ উভয়ের ইংরেজি চর্চার প্রয়োজন উল্লেখ নেই, এবং ঘ ট্রেন/ছুটির সময়ের মতো প্রযুক্তিগত বিবরণ পরিচয় বিনিময়ের সিদ্ধান্তকে ব্যাখ্যা করে না।

Step 1: Read each option and look for the explicit phrase used to introduce oneself.  
Step 2: Option b, "Hello! May I introduce myself? I'm Sima." clearly contains the explicit introduction phrase "May I introduce myself?" and then gives her name, so this matches the question.  
Step 3: The other options (a, c, d) are greetings that state the name but do not use the explicit introductory phrasing, so they are less direct answers. Therefore the correct choice is b.

Step 2: Match the options to that purpose — option (c) "Practice speaking English" directly fits the core activity of a language club.  
Therefore the correct answer is (c). Options (a), (b), and (d) are less likely because playing games, watching movies, or reading novels do not directly describe the main communicative practice focus of a language club.

1. Read the context and identify Tamal’s stated intention — he wants Sima to meet Andy so they can practise speaking English together.  
2. That directly matches option (a), “To practice their English.”  
3. Other options are unlikely: (b) “To ask for help” and (c) “To join a project” are not mentioned, and (d) “To get his phone number” is unrelated to practising English.

Step 2: Match those clues to the options — they clearly correspond to Bangladesh, so option b is correct. Step 3: Eliminate the others: (a) American history would reference U.S.-specific events or figures, (c) science fiction would have futuristic or imaginary elements, and (d) travel guides would be instructional rather than informative about a country itself. Therefore the new person is reading about Bangladesh (option b).

Options:
a. Can I call you Sima?
b. Are you from Dhaka?
c. What do you do?
d. Do you like books?


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the context — after an introduction, a natural follow-up is asking how to address the person.  
Step 2: Compare options: a "Can I call you Sima?" directly relates to how to address her; the others ask about origin, job, or preferences which are less immediate after a brief introduction.  
Step 3: Choose the best fit — option (a) is the most natural question right after introductions.

Explanation of incorrect options:
- (b) "Are you from Dhaka?" asks about origin, not about how to address her.  
- (c) "What do you do?" asks about occupation, also less immediate.  
- (d) "Do you like books?" asks a personal preference unrelated to introductions.

Therefore the correct answer is c.

Question:
Which expression can be used when ending a conversation?

Options:
a. Thank you.
b. Nice meeting you.
c. Hello!
d. Please call me.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Determine the intent — we want a phrase typically used to end a conversation or meeting.  
Step 2: Evaluate the options: "Hello!" is a greeting (start), "Please call me." asks for future contact (not a simple closing), and "Thank you." expresses gratitude but is not specifically a conversational closing.  
Step 3: Choose b — "Nice meeting you." is a common polite way to conclude a conversation or meeting, so it is the best fit.

Question:
What activity involves reading for Sima, Tamal, and Andy?

Options:
a. Reading novels
b. Reading newspapers
c. Reading about Bangladesh
d. Reading comics


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Determine the common activity asked for — what all three (Sima, Tamal and Andy) are doing.
Step 2: Compare the options to the information (or to the statement that identifies their shared activity). The option that directly matches the described activity is (c) "Reading about Bangladesh."
Step 3: Conclude that (c) is correct because it explicitly names the subject they read about. Options (a) "Reading novels", (b) "Reading newspapers", and (d) "Reading comics" do not match the stated common activity, so they are incorrect.

Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Scan the passage for any explicit mention of working with an NGO.  
Step 2: Match that mention to the listed names. Only Andy Smith is explicitly described as working with an NGO, while Tamal, Sima, and Jessica are not linked to an NGO in the text.  
Therefore the correct answer is d: Andy Smith.

Question:
How does Sima feel meeting Jessica?

Options:
a. She is bored.
b. She is happy.
c. She is sad.
d. She is uninterested.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for the emotional cues in the text that describe Sima’s reaction when she meets Jessica — words like “smiled”, “excited”, “happy”, “glad”, “warmly greeted” indicate positive feelings.  
Step 2: The description shows positive reactions (smiling, pleasure, enthusiastic greeting), so the best match is that Sima feels happy. Therefore option b is correct.  
Why others are wrong: options a (bored), c (sad) and d (uninterested) contradict the positive cues and so do not fit the described reaction.

Options:
a. What do you do?
b. Can I call you?
c. May I introduce myself?
d. Who are you?


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the function of each option — (a) "What do you do?" asks about occupation, (b) "Can I call you?" asks permission to phone or use a name, (c) "May I introduce myself?" is a polite opener that leads to exchanging names, and (d) "Who are you?" is direct and can sound rude.  
Step 2: Choose the most useful, polite expression for initiating a name exchange — option (c) is correct because it invites a mutual introduction, often followed by giving names.  
Step 3: Why the others are incorrect: (a) asks about job, not name; (b) asks permission to call someone, not to learn their name; (d) asks identity bluntly and is less appropriate in polite conversation.

How does Jessica respond to Sima's greetings?

Options:
a. I'm Jessica.
b. Hi!
c. Nice to meet you.
d. Hello!


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the expected immediate reply to a greeting — a short reciprocal greeting is typical.  
Step 2: Among the options, b "Hi!" is a direct, simple response to someone saying hello.  

Therefore the correct answer is b.

Explanation of other options: a "I'm Jessica." is an introduction rather than a direct reply to a greeting; c "Nice to meet you." is used when first meeting someone, not as a brief greeting reply; d "Hello!" is also a greeting but the provided correct response is specifically "Hi!".

Step 2: Match that statement to the options: option c corresponds to "In 10 minutes," so it is the correct choice.

Question:
Which expression would Sima likely use when she bids farewell to Jessica?

Options:
a. Goodbye!
b. See you soon!
c. Have a nice trip!
d. Good night!


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the context: Sima is bidding farewell to Jessica, which suggests Jessica is leaving (likely traveling).  
2. Choose the most appropriate phrase for someone who is about to leave on a trip: "Have a nice trip!" — this directly wishes her well for travel, so option c is correct.  
3. Why the others are less suitable: "Goodbye!" (a) is generic but not specific to travel; "See you soon!" (b) implies an expected near-future meeting; "Good night!" (d) is appropriate only if parting at night. Therefore the best choice is c.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the relevant sentence in the passage to find what prompted Sima to meet Andy — it explicitly says that Tamal suggested she meet him.  
Step 2: That direct suggestion is the motivating factor, so the correct choice is (b) a suggestion from Tamal.  
Step 3: The other options are incorrect because there is no mention of her meeting Andy being driven by her interest in learning (a), a class assignment (c), or an attempt to impress Jessica (d).

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the clue — the description indicates Andy is involved in community projects/charitable activities and works with volunteers, which matches working for a non-governmental organization.  
Step 2: Eliminate other options — he is not described as attending classes (so not a student), there is no mention of cooking or serving food (so not working in a restaurant), and there is no indication of classroom teaching (so not a teacher).  
Step 3: Conclusion — therefore the correct choice is option c: he works with an NGO.

Options:
a. Reading and writing
b. Listening and speaking
c. Watching and summarizing
d. Writing essays


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: We look for the primary activities described for Sima and Tamal — if the context emphasizes exchanging ideas aloud, replying, asking questions or listening to each other, those are oral language tasks. That matches option (b) listening and speaking. Other options are less fitting: (a) reading and writing focuses on text-based work, (c) watching and summarizing emphasizes visual/comprehension tasks, and (d) writing essays is a specific focused writing task rather than general interaction. Hence the correct choice is (b) Listening and speaking.

The phrase asks what Sima wants to do with Andy — among the choices, "practice English" directly describes an interactive activity to do together, so option b is the best fit.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the question — it asks for Tamal’s attitude toward meeting Andy.  
Step 2: Look for Tamal’s response or wording that indicates his feeling; he shows a positive/agreeing reaction (enthusiasm or approval).  
Therefore the correct choice is b (He thinks it's a good idea).

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for the main subject of the text Andy is reading — the passage explicitly discusses Bangladesh (places, culture and topics specific to that country).  
Step 2: That direct focus on Bangladesh indicates the book’s primary theme is about the country itself.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is b: a book about Bangladesh. Other options are less fitting: a history book would emphasize past events, a travel guide would focus on itineraries and practical tips, and a science book would present scientific concepts, none of which match the passage’s country-focused content.

What is Sima's intention when talking to Jessica?

Options:
a. To become friends
b. To learn about her
c. To offer assistance
d. To create a business tie


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify clues in Sima's language and topics—if she asks about Jessica’s hobbies, background, and shares personal details in a friendly tone, the primary intent is social connection.  
Step 2: Match that intent to the options: choosing "to become friends" best fits a conversational, personal interest without offers of help or business proposals.  
Step 3: Why other options are unlikely — "to learn about her" (b) is narrower and sounds more investigative than friendly; "to offer assistance" (c) would include explicit offers to help; "to create a business tie" (d) would involve professional or transactional language.  
Therefore the correct answer is a: To become friends.

Options:
a. Please, join me.
b. Can I call you Sima?
c. What do you like?
d. Where do you live?


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — Andy wants Sima to feel comfortable and respond in a friendly way.  
Step 2: Evaluate each option for politeness and appropriateness: "Can I call you Sima?" is a polite, respectful request that invites consent and friendliness; the others are either invitations or personal questions that can feel abrupt or intrusive.  
Step 3: Conclude that option b is best because it shows respect for Sima’s preference and opens a friendly channel of communication.  

Why the others are less suitable: option a sounds like a direct command/invitation without building rapport, option c is vague and may be too broad, and option d asks a personal question that might make Sima uncomfortable.

Which feeling does Sima exhibit in the text?

Options:
a. Excitement
b. Indifference
c. Boredom
d. Fear


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the textual clues: Sima’s words, tone, and actions (e.g., animated gestures, exclamations, quick movements) show positive high arousal and eagerness—typical markers of excitement.
2. Match the emotion: these markers correspond to "Excitement" rather than a neutral or negative state.
3. Why others are incorrect: Indifference would show lack of reaction; boredom would show disengagement or slow, uninterested behavior; fear would show withdrawal, anxiety, or avoidance—none of which fit the described energetic, eager behavior.

Therefore the correct answer is: a (Excitement).

Options:
a. She is going with her friends.
b. She is going for work.
c. She is on a holiday.
d. She is relocating.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify keywords in the prompt or passage about Jessica’s trip — words like “relax,” “sightseeing,” “vacation,” “time off,” or descriptions of leisure activities indicate leisure rather than work or permanent move.  
Step 2: Use those clues to infer intent: leisure words imply a temporary, recreational purpose, so the trip is a holiday.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options: there is no mention of colleagues or group travel (so not clearly going with friends), no work-related tasks or business meetings are described (so not for work), and nothing suggests a permanent move or long-term packing/relocation (so not relocating).  
Therefore the best inference is option (c): she is on a holiday.

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the context — when people part ways, a common farewell relating to travel is used.  
Step 2: Identify the option that matches a farewell for someone leaving: option (a) "Have a good journey" directly expresses good wishes for travel.  
Step 3: Explain why others are wrong — (b) "See you later" implies a planned future meeting, (c) "Nice to meet you" is used at an initial introduction, and (d) "Have fun" is a casual wish for enjoyment rather than a travel farewell.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a) Have a good journey.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:

Step 1: লক্ষ্য হচ্ছে ইংরেজি দক্ষতা বাড়ানো; এর জন্য সক্রিয় ভাষা ব্যবহার—অর্থাৎ কথা বলা ও শুনা—অনুশীলন সবচেয়ে কার্যকর।

Step 3: অন্যগুলো ভুল কেন: a (নিজের মাতৃভাষায় বই পড়া) সরাসরি ইংরেজি দক্ষতা বাড়ায় না; b (অনুবাদ ছাড়া ইংরেজি মুভি দেখা) সহায়ক হতে পারে কিন্তু শুরুতে বোঝা কঠিন হলে অপ্রতিষ্ঠিত হতে পারে; d (ইংরেজি বলাটা এড়ানো) সম্পূর্ণ বিরোধী — দক্ষতা বাড়ানোর কোনো সুযোগই পাবে না।

Question:
Who is the new person in the language club?

Options:
a. Tamal
b. Andy Smith
c. Jessica
d. Sima


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Read the passage/announcement and locate the phrase identifying the "new" member (look for words like "new member", "just joined", or an introduction).  
Step 2: Match that description to the name given — the text explicitly introduces Andy Smith as the new person in the language club.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: Andy Smith. Other options (Tamal, Jessica, Sima) are incorrect because the passage does not describe them as newly joined members.

Question:
How does Sima introduce Andy to Tamal?

Options:
a. By saying "This is my friend Andy."
b. By saying "Meet my cousin Andy."
c. By saying "Hello, Andy!"
d. By saying "This is my classmate Andy."


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence Sima uses to introduce Andy and identify its function — an introduction that names the relationship.  
Step 2: Compare each option: option (a) "This is my friend Andy." exactly states an introduction and relationship; (b) says "cousin" (different relationship), (d) says "classmate" (different relationship), and (c) "Hello, Andy!" is only a greeting, not an introduction.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a) because it precisely matches a direct introduction of Andy as Sima's friend.

Question:
Analyze why Sima wants to practice English with Andy.

Options:
a. Because she is bored
b. To improve her language skills
c. To have fun
d. Because she doesn't like Tamal


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the question to identify Sima’s purpose: she wants to “practice English with Andy,” which indicates a goal related to her language ability.
2. Reasoning: Practicing with a partner is typically done to improve speaking, vocabulary, grammar, and confidence—so the primary motive is to improve her language skills. Therefore option (b) is correct.
3. Why the others are wrong: (a) “Because she is bored” and (c) “To have fun” might be possible secondary reasons but are not stated as the main goal; (d) “Because she doesn't like Tamal” has no supporting evidence in the prompt.

Question:
What is the main reason Sima and Tamal want to meet Andy at the Town Hall Language Club?

Options:
a. They want to practice English with him.
b. They need help with a project.
c. They are looking for a new book.
d. They want to join his NGO.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the context — the meeting place is the Town Hall Language Club, which indicates a focus on language practice.  
Step 2: Infer the purpose — meeting someone at a language club most likely means they want to practice language skills with that person. Therefore option a is the best fit.  
Why others are incorrect: b (project help) and d (join his NGO) are unrelated to a language club setting, and c (looking for a new book) is less likely since the venue is a club for language practice rather than a bookshop.  
Correct answer: a.

Question:
What is the main purpose of Sima and Tamal's visit to the Town Hall Language Club, and how does it relate to their interaction with Andy?

Options:
a. To attend a lecture about Bangladesh, where they meet Andy.
b. To practice speaking English, which leads them to introduce themselves to Andy.
c. To watch English movies, after which they meet Andy.
d. To read books in English, and they find out about Andy's NGO work.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — Sima and Tamal attend the Town Hall Language Club to improve and practice their spoken English.  
Step 2: Link to their interaction with Andy — because their purpose is practising speaking, they introduce themselves and talk to Andy to get speaking practice.  
Conclusion: therefore option b is correct.  
Why others are wrong: option a (attend a lecture about Bangladesh) and option c (watch English movies) and option d (read English books and learn about Andy’s NGO) do not match the stated reason for visiting the Language Club, which centers on practising spoken English.

If Sima is going to Sylhet and Jessica is going to Chattogram, who is traveling to Dhaka?

Options:

c. Neither of them
d. Both of them


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Given that Sima is going to Sylhet and Jessica is going to Chattogram — both destinations are explicitly stated.  
Step 2: Since neither person is said to be going to Dhaka, no one in the two named persons is traveling to Dhaka.  
Conclusion: Therefore the correct answer is c: Neither of them. Options a and b are wrong because those assign Dhaka to Sima or Jessica contrary to the given information; option d is wrong because both are going to other cities, not Dhaka.

Predict what might happen when Sima meets Andy at the Town Hall Language Club.

Options:
a. They will ignore each other
b. They will practice speaking English together
c. They will leave the club
d. They will argue


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify context — a "Town Hall Language Club" is a place where people meet specifically to practice a language (English).
Step 2: Infer likely behavior — if Sima meets Andy there, the most reasonable activity is that they will practice speaking English together because that matches the club's purpose.
Step 3: Eliminate other choices — ignoring each other or leaving the club contradicts the expected goal of attending, and arguing is not implied by the context.
Conclusion: The best choice is (b) They will practice speaking English together.

Options:

c. This is my friend, Sima Zaman

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the purpose — Sima is introducing her friend to Andy, so the sentence should state that someone is her friend and give the friend’s name.
Step 2: Compare options — option c, "This is my friend, Sima Zaman," exactly announces a friend and provides the name, so it fits the purpose.
Step 3: Eliminate other options — option a ("This is my cousin") indicates a family relation, option b ("Meet my classmate") refers to a classmate without a name, and option d ("Allow me to introduce my sister") introduces a sibling, not a friend. Therefore the correct answer is option c.

Question:
What did Tamal and Sima come to the Town Hall Language Club to do?

Options:


Correct Answer: To practice speaking English.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the relevant text or context that describes Tamal and Sima’s purpose for coming to the Town Hall Language Club — look for a phrase indicating their activity or goal (e.g., “to practise speaking English”).  
Step 2: Match that phrase to the answer choices. The sentence explicitly states they came to practise speaking English, so this directly supports the correct choice.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options (for example, “to learn grammar” or “to teach”) because the passage specifies practising spoken English rather than studying rules or instructing others.

Therefore, the correct answer is: To practice speaking English.

Options:
a. To enhance vocabulary and storytelling skills.
b. To practice conversational skills in English.

Step 2: Match that purpose to the options: option b ("To practice conversational skills in English") directly describes practicing spoken conversation, so it is the correct choice.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out the others: option a focuses on vocabulary and storytelling (not the main aim of role-play), option c emphasizes physical activity for memorization (not relevant), and option d targets writing skills (role-play is oral).

Options:
a. Dialogue scripts.
b. Slips of paper with vocabulary words.
c. Magazines, colored pencils, paper.
d. Paper, colored pencils.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: "Picture Storytelling" কার্যক্রমের উদ্দেশ্য হলো ছবি বা ভিজ্যুয়াল ব্যবহার করে একটা গল্প তৈরি করা—তাই কার্যক্রমের জন্য চিত্র সংগ্রহ এবং ছবি আঁকা/সংকলনের উপকরণ লাগবে।  
ধাপ ২: ম্যাগাজিনগুলো থেকে উপযুক্ত ছবি কেটে নেওয়া যায় এবং রঙিন পেন্সিল ও কাগজে সেগুলো দিয়ে স্টোরিবোর্ড বা ছবির কাহিনি সাজানো যায়; এই কারণে ম্যাগাজিন, রঙিন পেন্সিল ও কাগজই প্রয়োজনীয়।  
ধাপ ৩: অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো কেন ভুল— ক (Dialogue scripts) মূলত কথোপকথনের জন্য, খ (Slips of paper with vocabulary words) শিখনের জন্য; ঘ (Paper, colored pencils) আংশিক সঠিক কিন্তু ম্যাগাজিনের মতো ভিজ্যুয়াল উৎস বাদ দেয়।  
সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: গ (c) — ম্যাগাজিন, রঙিন পেন্সিল, কাগজ।

Question:
What is the expected outcome of Activity 3: Vocabulary Charades?

Options:
a. Students will improve their speaking and listening skills.
b. Students will develop creativity, teamwork, and narrative skills.
c. Students will reinforce their vocabulary retention and improve their ability to communicate non-verbally.
d. Students will enhance their writing skills.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what "Vocabulary Charades" requires — students act out words without speaking, so the activity emphasizes remembering word meanings and communicating through gestures and body language.  
Step 2: Match this with the options: option (c) ("reinforce their vocabulary retention and improve their ability to communicate non-verbally") directly describes those outcomes.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out others: (a) is about speaking/listening which charades does not practice much; (b) partly true (creativity and teamwork may improve) but it omits the key focus on non‑verbal communication and vocabulary retention; (d) is unrelated because charades does not target writing.  
Therefore the correct answer is (c).

Question:
What type of activity is Activity 4: Writing a Postcard?

Options:
a. Pair
b. Group
c. Whole-class
d. Individual


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the nature of the task — "Writing a Postcard" requires each learner to compose their own short personal message, which is a solo productive writing task.  
Step 2: Decide the interaction pattern — because the task focuses on an individual composing and organizing personal information, it is carried out alone rather than collaboratively.  
Therefore the correct choice is d (Individual). Options a, b, and c are incorrect because pair, group, or whole-class activities involve shared interaction or joint production, which does not match a solitary writing task like a postcard.

b. To reinforce vocabulary recognition and listening skills.
c. To enhance vocabulary and storytelling skills.
d. To help students learn and remember vocabulary through physical activity.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main goal of "Word Bingo" — the activity typically calls out or plays words and students mark them on their cards, so it practices recognizing words by sight and sound (vocabulary recognition and listening).  
Step 2: Match this goal to the options: option b correctly states "To reinforce vocabulary recognition and listening skills."  
Step 3: Why the others are incorrect: option a focuses on writing (not primary in Bingo), option c adds storytelling (not central to Bingo), and option d emphasizes physical activity (not the main objective).  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Options (a) and (d) (school trip or job interview) describe organized or professional purposes that do not match the stated reason, and (b) "To visit relatives" is more general, whereas (c) specifies her father specifically, so (c) is the best choice.

Question:
What is Tamal's relationship with Sima?

Options:
a. Classmate
b. Cousin
c. Friend
d. Teacher


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the nature of interaction described between Tamal and Sima — they spend time together, share interests, and support each other.  
Step 2: Match that pattern to the relationship options: a (classmate) denotes only shared class, b (cousin) denotes family tie, d (teacher) denotes an instructional role; c (friend) denotes voluntary social bond with mutual interest and support.  
Step 3: Conclude that the behavior fits "friend" best, so the correct answer is c.

Explanation of other options:
- a (Classmate): would apply only if the statement mentioned they study together in the same class without social closeness.  
- b (Cousin): would require a family relationship explicitly stated.  
- d (Teacher): would require one to be in an instructional role toward the other. None of these fit the described interactions, so they are incorrect.

Options:

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Note the setting — a "Town Hall Language Club" implies the purpose is learning languages.  
Step 2: From that context, meeting Andy at a language club most likely means he helps with speaking a language, so "Speaking English" is the best fit.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is b. Options a, c, and d (cooking, gardening, playing sports) are unrelated to a language club and so are unlikely.

Step 2: Compare options: option b ("Eat food that gives energy") exactly matches the doctor's advice; option a ("Go to school"), option c ("Stay outside"), and option d ("Visit her friends") are not medical recommendations to improve health or energy.

Step 2: Option (b) "He volunteered first" is the correct choice because it directly states a positive, voluntary reason for joining, which matches the typical way people enter such public-service roles.  
Step 3: The other options are unlikely: (a) "He was forced to join" implies coercion with no supporting evidence, (c) "He wanted to earn money" reduces a service role to purely financial motive and is not indicated, and (d) "He liked playing with fire" describes dangerous behavior incompatible with responsible firefighting.

Method: by matching local geography and maps of Bangladesh one finds the Narasunda as the main river within Kishoreganj municipality. The other options are incorrect because the Ganges and Jamuna are major rivers farther west/central and do not flow through Kishoreganj, and the Meghna is a larger eastern river system but not the principal river of Kishoreganj.

Question:
Why is Sima meeting Jessica?

Options:
a. To attend a class
b. To introduce herself
c. To go shopping
d. To visit a friend


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and each option to identify Sima’s purpose for meeting Jessica.  
Step 2: Choose the option that best matches the intent of meeting someone new — "to introduce herself" clearly shows an initial meeting purpose.

Reasoning: "To introduce herself" directly explains why two people would meet when they are not already acquainted. The other options are less likely: (a) "To attend a class" implies a scheduled class rather than a personal meeting; (c) "To go shopping" describes an activity, not an introduction; (d) "To visit a friend" implies they are already friends, which contradicts the need to introduce oneself.

Correct answer: (b) To introduce herself.

Step 2: Compare the options to the exact meaning "wish Jessica a good journey." Option b, "Have a good journey!", matches this wording directly.  
Step 3: Check other options briefly: a ("Have a nice train ride!") specifies a train (too specific); c ("Enjoy your trip!") and d ("Safe travels!") are acceptable alternatives but do not match the exact phrase asked.

Solution:
Solution: Identify the most relevant reason why Sima would practice English with Andy. Working for an NGO often requires good English and gives Andy practical experience using English, so Sima could learn from his real-life usage and get useful practice. Options a, b and d are less likely: being a teacher (a) is not stated and doesn’t necessarily mean he’s available to practice; reading about Bangladesh (b) doesn’t imply he can help Sima practice speaking; being Tamal’s friend (d) doesn’t explain why he would be a good English partner. Therefore the best choice is c.

ব্যাখ্যা: অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো—nervous (উদ্বিগ্ন), indifferent (উৎসাহহীন/উদাসীন), bored (বিরক্ত)—এগুলো Sima-র উল্লিখিত ইতিবাচক ও উৎসাহী আচরণের সাথে মিলছে না, তাই সেগুলো ভুল।

Explanation of other options: Going shopping (a) or taking a nap (d) would make her miss the train, and waiting for more friends (b) wastes the remaining time; therefore they are incorrect.

Step 2: Therefore the correct choice is option (b) "At the bookshop."

Options:
a. Speak only in Bangla
b. Read books in English
c. Avoid speaking
d. Listen to songs in Bangla


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — Sima wants to practice and improve her English, so she needs activities that provide exposure to English vocabulary, grammar and comprehension.  
Step 2: Evaluate the options — (a) speaking only in Bangla and (d) listening to songs in Bangla give little or no English exposure; (c) avoiding speaking reduces practice opportunities. Option (b) reading books in English directly increases vocabulary, understanding of sentence structure, and reading fluency.  
Conclusion: Therefore the best choice is (b) Read books in English.

Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize this refers to the classic fable "The Tortoise and the Hare," where one runner becomes overconfident.  
Step 2: In the story the hare stops to rest and falls asleep during the race, allowing the tortoise to win.  
Therefore the correct choice is d: The hare. The other options are incorrect because the tortoise keeps moving steadily, and "Bluster" and "Andy" are not characters who sleep in this story.

The other options are incorrect because there's no mention of them stealing his food, home, or treasure in the story, so the correct choice is (b) His voice.

What lesson does the tortoise teach the hare at the end of their race?

Options:
a. Winning takes speed
b. Slow but steady wins the race
c. Practicing makes perfect
d. Always take a nap


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the fable — the hare is fast but becomes overconfident and takes a nap, while the tortoise moves slowly and steadily without stopping.  
Step 2: Identify the moral shown at the finish: the tortoise wins because consistent, steady effort over time beats sporadic speed.  
Step 3: Therefore the best choice is (b) "Slow but steady wins the race." Options (a) and (d) are contradicted by the story (speed alone or always napping do not guarantee victory), and (c) is not the primary lesson emphasized.

Question:
How can planting trees help the environment in rural areas?

Options:
a. They provide shade
b. They increase pollution
c. They help in soil erosion
d. They improve air quality


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what planting trees does — trees absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants and release oxygen, and their leaves and bark trap particulates.  
Step 2: Match these effects to the choices: this directly corresponds to improving air quality, so option d is the best fit.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others — option a (they provide shade) is true but only a secondary benefit; option b (they increase pollution) is false; option c (they help in soil erosion) is ambiguously worded (planting trees prevents soil erosion, it does not “help in” causing it), so it does not match as clearly as d.  
Therefore the correct answer is d.

Question:
If a farmer grows rice and vegetables, which is an advantage of this practice?

Options:
a. It uses more water
b. It increases crop diversity
c. It requires less labor
d. It limits food options


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Growing rice and vegetables together is a form of crop diversification or mixed cropping, so the farmer produces more than one type of crop.  
Step 2: This practice increases crop diversity because there are multiple crop species on the farm, which improves dietary variety, spreads risk from pests or bad weather, and can give more market options.  
Why other options are incorrect: a is not generally an advantage—rice is water‑intensive but mixing with vegetables doesn’t inherently increase total water use; c is false because managing multiple crops often needs similar or more labor; d is opposite to the truth since growing both expands, not limits, food options.  
Correct answer: b.

Options:
a. It helps them make friends.
b. It improves their language skills.
c. It encourages them to speak.
d. All of the above.

Step 2: Regular interaction with peers exposes learners to varied vocabulary and structures, thereby improving their language skills (option b).  
Step 3: Meeting new people motivates learners to communicate and practice speaking, reducing hesitation and encouraging conversation (option c).

How might traveling to different places change a person’s perspective on life?

Options:
a. It doesn't change anything.
b. It can narrow their view.
c. It can broaden their understanding of cultures.
d. It only provides entertainment.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Traveling exposes a person to different people, customs, languages, and ways of thinking, so they encounter perspectives beyond their usual experience.  
Step 2: By comparing and reflecting on these new experiences, a traveler gains empathy, reduces stereotypes, and sees alternatives to their prior assumptions.  
Conclusion: Therefore option c is correct — travel can broaden understanding of cultures.  
Brief note on other options: a is incorrect because exposure typically does change people; b is the opposite of the common effect; d is incomplete since travel can entertain but also educates and changes worldview.

Question:
How do Sima and Tamal plan to introduce themselves?

Options:
a. By writing letters
b. By chatting online
c. By meeting in person
d. By sending messages


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the key phrase "plan to introduce themselves" — this most naturally implies a face‑to‑face, personal introduction.  
Step 2: Compare the options: a (writing letters), b (chatting online), and d (sending messages) are indirect or electronic means, not direct introductions. Option c (by meeting in person) matches the idea of personally introducing themselves.  
Therefore the correct answer is c: By meeting in person.

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: প্রশ্নে বলা হয়েছে Sima এবং Tamal এর ইংরেজি শেখার উদ্দেশ্য তুলনা করতে হবে; বিকল্প (a) বলছে Sima মজা করার জন্য শেখে আর Tamal স্কুলের জন্য শেখে — এটা স্পষ্টভাবে উদ্দেশ্য/প্রেরণার পার্থক্য নির্দেশ করে।  
Step 2: অন্য বিকল্পগুলো যাচাই করলে দেখা যায় (b) একই কারণ বললে পার্থক্য অস্বীকার করে, (c) ভ্রমণ বনাম কাজ—যা মূল প্রশ্নের দেওয়া সত্যতার সঙ্গে মেলেনা, এবং (d) একা বা বন্ধুদের সঙ্গে শেখা পদ্ধতি সম্পর্কিত, উদ্দেশ্য নয়।  
সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে a।

Step 1: From the given information Andy Smith is explicitly described as working for an NGO, so that statement directly identifies his occupation.  
Step 2: Eliminate the other choices because they contradict or are not stated by the information: a (teacher) is not mentioned, b (a gentleman reading a book) describes an activity not his job, and c (friend of Sima) is not indicated.

What does Sima say when she introduces herself?

Options:
a. Nice to meet you
b. May I introduce myself?
c. How are you?
d. Please call me Sima


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the context — when a person is introducing themselves, they ask permission or state their name.  
Step 2: Compare the options: "May I introduce myself?" directly expresses the act of introducing, while "Nice to meet you" is said after introductions, "How are you?" is a greeting, and "Please call me Sima" is a request about what to call her.  
Step 3: Conclude that the sentence used to introduce oneself is option b.  

Explanation: Option b is the correct choice because it explicitly asks to introduce oneself; the other options serve different conversational functions.

Solution:

ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নে Sima-এর Andy-র সাথে দেখা করার উদ্দেশ্য কী তা জানতে বলা হয়েছে; সাধারণ প্রসঙ্গে "practice English" বলতে বোঝায় ভাষা অনুশীলন করা।

ব্যাখ্যা: অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলি — বই নিয়ে আলোচনা করা (a), সাহায্য চাওয়া (c) বা নতুন বন্ধু করা (d) — এর জন্য প্রশ্নে কোনো স্পষ্ট ধারনা নেই, তাই সেগুলো ঠিক নয়।

Options:

b. By improving their English speaking skills
c. By showing them how to avoid talking
d. By helping them learn new languages


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the purpose of Sima and Jessica’s conversation — if it is a dialogue between two people using English, a likely benefit is practice in speaking and listening.  
Step 2: Match that purpose to the options: option b ("By improving their English speaking skills") directly describes that benefit.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options: option a (“ignore strangers”) and option c (“avoid talking”) contradict the idea of a conversation, and option d (“helping them learn new languages”) is broader than the specific benefit of practicing English.

Options:
a. By sharing personal information and asking questions.
b. By avoiding eye contact and remaining silent.
c. By discussing their favorite food.
d. By making plans to travel together.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Sima's behavior — she shares information about herself and asks Jessica questions.  
Step 2: Compare this to common social practices when meeting someone new: people typically introduce themselves, give basic personal details, and ask questions to learn about the other person.  
Step 3: Conclude that option a matches exactly.

Explanation of other choices:
- b is incorrect because avoiding eye contact and remaining silent is not a typical way to start a new social interaction.  
- c is incorrect because talking about favorite food might occur but is a specific topic, not the general pattern of introducing oneself and asking questions.  
- d is incorrect because making travel plans is a later-stage interaction, not a common first step when meeting someone new.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the clue — they attend the Town Hall Language Club, which by name focuses on language practice and learning.  
Step 2: Infer purpose — a language club’s primary goal is to help members improve their language skills (speaking, listening, vocabulary).  
Step 3: Eliminate other options — socializing, reading English books, or listening to music (options c and d and a) are possible secondary activities but are not the main purpose implied by “Language Club.”

b. They are classmates working together.
c. They are just acquaintances with no common interests.
d. They are friends supporting each other's learning.


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the key information — both Sima and Tamal are described in the context of the Language Club and shown to help or encourage one another in learning. That indicates a supportive, friendly relationship rather than mere competition or indifference.
Step 2: Eliminate alternatives — option a (competitors) contradicts the mutual support; option b (classmates working together) could be partly true but is narrower and doesn’t emphasize the supportive friendship; option c (just acquaintances with no common interests) contradicts their shared activity and support.
Step 3: Conclude that option d is correct because it best matches the evidence that they are friends who support each other’s learning in the club.

a. It is a quiet place for reading.
b. It offers opportunities to practice English in a social setting.
c. It is a competitive environment.
d. It is a place where they can watch movies.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the setting: the "Town Hall Language Club" is described as a place where people meet to use and practice a language, so its primary function is social language practice.
2. Match this to the options: option b states it "offers opportunities to practice English in a social setting," which directly fits the club’s purpose.
3. Rule out the others: option a (quiet place for reading) conflicts with the social/practice nature; option c (competitive environment) is not implied; option d (place to watch movies) is not indicated.

How do Jessica's and Sima's origins influence their conversation?

Options:
a. They share a common language.
b. They have different cultural backgrounds.
c. They both dislike traveling.
d. They are both from the same city.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what “origins” refers to — it means their different hometowns or cultural roots, which shape perspectives, customs, and references in conversation.
Step 2: Reason how that shows up — if Jessica and Sima mention different traditions, foods, expressions, or viewpoints, that indicates different cultural backgrounds influencing their dialogue.
Conclusion: Therefore option (b) is correct: they have different cultural backgrounds.
Why others are wrong: (a) sharing a common language is not implied by differing origins, (c) disliking traveling is unrelated to origins, and (d) being from the same city contradicts the idea that their origins influence the conversation through cultural differences.

c. They prefer to learn through books only.
d. They avoid practicing speaking.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify evidence from the activities — Sima and Tamal attend the Language Club and take part in practice sessions, which shows active effort to use and improve English.  
Step 2: Match that evidence to the options — active practice and participation align with being dedicated to improving their English skills, so option (b) fits best.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices — (a) is wrong because their actions are learning-focused, not just socializing; (c) is wrong because they use speaking practice rather than only books; (d) is wrong because they do practice speaking.  

Therefore the correct answer is (b).

c. To work

Question:
What is Sima's train doing?

Options:
a. Arriving
b. Leaving in 10 minutes
c. Delayed
d. Full


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret each option — "Arriving" means coming into the station, "Leaving in 10 minutes" means the train will depart shortly, "Delayed" means it's running late, and "Full" refers to no available seats.  
Step 2: The phrase "doing" asks for the train's current action/status; "leaving in 10 minutes" clearly describes an immediate departing action.  
Therefore the correct choice is b.  
Why the others are incorrect: "Arriving" is the opposite action, "Delayed" implies lateness rather than imminent departure, and "Full" describes capacity, not the train's action.

Question:
How can Sima introduce herself to someone new?

Options:
a. I'm leaving now.
b. May I introduce myself?
c. I have a train to catch.
d. I don't speak.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the purpose — Sima wants to introduce herself to someone new, so we look for a polite phrase used to begin an introduction.
Step 2: Evaluate options: (a) "I'm leaving now." — unrelated to introducing oneself; (c) "I have a train to catch." — gives a reason for leaving, not an introduction; (d) "I don't speak." — states inability to speak, not an introduction. Option (b) "May I introduce myself?" is a direct, polite way to begin introducing oneself.
Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
Why does Sima want to meet Andy?

Options:
a. To ask him a question
b. To practice English
c. Because he is famous
d. To borrow a book


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence about Sima’s purpose for meeting Andy and identify the explicit reason given (she wants to improve or use English with him).
Step 2: Match that reason to the options: option b ("To practice English") directly states this purpose.
Step 3: Conclude that option b is correct because it exactly matches the stated intention.

Why other options are incorrect: option a ("To ask him a question") is too general and not stated; option c ("Because he is famous") is irrelevant; option d ("To borrow a book") is not mentioned. Therefore the correct answer is b.

If Sima and Tamal practice with Andy, how will it help them in the future?

Options:
a. They will learn more vocabulary
b. They can travel abroad
c. They will become famous
d. They won’t need to study


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
1. Practice with Andy implies regular interaction and language use, which naturally builds and reinforces word knowledge and vocabulary.
2. Therefore the direct benefit is that Sima and Tamal will learn more vocabulary, so option (a) is correct.
3. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because practicing with Andy does not necessarily enable international travel, guarantee fame, or remove the need for studying — those outcomes are unrelated or far less direct than gaining vocabulary.

Step 2 — Match options to that purpose: option (b) "To practice speaking English" directly matches the typical goal of a language club, so it is the correct choice.

Step 1: Identify key clues from the text (place names, cultural or historical references). If the passage mentions Dhaka, Bengali language, Liberation War, or other Bangladesh-specific facts, that points to Bangladesh.  
Step 2: Compare against other options: English grammar would focus on rules and examples of language structure, the United Kingdom would mention London/UK institutions, and a novel would read like a fictional narrative with characters and plot.

How can learning English benefit students in Bangladesh?

Options:
a. It helps them read more books.
b. It allows them to travel abroad.
c. It opens more job opportunities.
d. All of the above.


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Examine each option — a: helps read more books (English gives access to many texts), b: allows travel abroad (English is a common international lingua franca), c: opens more job opportunities (many employers require English skills).
Step 2: Reasoning — since learning English directly produces all three listed benefits, none of the options a–c contradicts the others; they are complementary advantages of English proficiency.
Step 3: Conclusion — therefore the best choice is d (All of the above), because English helps students read more books, travel abroad, and access more jobs.

Question:
What is the relationship between Sima and Jessica in their conversation, and how does it reflect their cultural backgrounds?

Options:
a. They are cousins from different cities, indicating a strong family tie.
b. They are strangers meeting for the first time, showcasing their diverse origins.
c. They are classmates who both come from Dhaka, reflecting a common hometown.
d. They are neighbors discussing local attractions, emphasizing community bonds.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Identify clues in the conversation indicating relationship — they ask about each other’s origins and there is no mention of family ties, shared school, or shared neighborhood.  
Step 2: Interpret those clues — asking where someone is from and commenting on different cultural backgrounds fits a meeting between strangers from diverse places.  
Therefore the correct choice is (b) because the dialogue presents them as meeting and comparing different origins.  
Why the others are wrong: (a) and (c) would require explicit family or shared-hometown references, and (d) would require details about local, neighborly knowledge or shared locality, none of which appear in the conversation.

Question:
How does the presence of the new person, Andy, in the Town Hall Language Club affect Sima and Tamal’s learning experience?

Options:
a. It distracts them from their practice by introducing a new topic.
b. It provides them an opportunity to practice English with a native speaker.
c. It makes them feel uncomfortable and reluctant to speak.
d. It encourages them to leave the club and explore other interests.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the role of Andy — he is described as a new person who speaks English natively, so his presence brings a native-speaker resource into the club.
Step 2: Assess the impact on Sima and Tamal — having a native speaker provides authentic listening models and a chance to practice conversational English, which helps their learning.
Step 3: Eliminate other options — a is incorrect because introducing a native speaker is not merely a distracting new topic; c is unsupported since the text implies opportunity rather than discomfort; d is incorrect because there is no indication they leave the club.
Therefore the correct answer is (b): It provides them an opportunity to practice English with a native speaker.

b. The emphasis on community and personal introductions.
c. The focus on historical landmarks in their regions.
d. The prominence of literature and famous writers.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

1. Read both passages carefully: Sima’s interaction with Jessica involves meeting and personal introduction, and Mamun’s description of Kishoreganj stresses people, local connections, and how residents introduce places and each other.
2. Identify the common theme: both emphasize community ties and the role of personal introductions in social life, which matches option (b).

Options:
a. It shows the challenges of speaking with older individuals.
b. It emphasizes the importance of practicing with native speakers.
c. It highlights the difficulties in understanding slang.
d. It suggests that only formal education is necessary for learning.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main point of Sima’s interaction with Andy — she gets real conversational practice, immediate feedback, and exposure to natural usage in a multicultural setting.  
Step 2: Reasoning — practicing with native speakers improves pronunciation, fluency, and cultural understanding in ways classroom-only study often cannot, so this interaction exemplifies that key aspect.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices briefly — a is irrelevant (age of interlocutor isn’t emphasized), c is too specific (slang isn’t the main focus), and d is contradicted by the example (it shows learning outside formal education is valuable).

Options:
a. They aim to compete against each other in language proficiency.
b. They seek to improve their language skills through collaboration.
c. They intend to focus on grammar exclusively.
d. They plan to study literature without practical application.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the pattern in their interactions — Sima, Tamal, and Andy work together, share feedback, and use group activities, which shows cooperative behavior.  
Step 2: Infer the common goal — such cooperative practices are aimed at improving each other’s language ability through practice and mutual support.  
Step 3: Match this inference to the options — option (b) "They seek to improve their language skills through collaboration" directly describes that goal.  
Why the others are incorrect: option (a) implies competition rather than cooperation; option (c) limits their focus to grammar only, which is too narrow; option (d) suggests studying literature without practical use, which contradicts the collaborative, practice-oriented behavior.

Step 1: Read the passage/dialogue about the meeting at the Town Hall Language Club and identify the name introduced as the new person.  
Step 2: The text explicitly names the newcomer as "Andy Smith."  
Therefore the correct choice is option b: Andy Smith.

Question:
How can Sima and Tamal practice their English with Andy?

Options:
a. By reading books
b. By chatting with him
c. By listening to CDs
d. By watching DVDs


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the phrase "practice their English with Andy" — this implies direct interaction or communication with Andy.  
Step 2: Among the choices, "By chatting with him" is the only option that involves real-time, interactive use of English, so the correct answer is b.  
Explanation of other options: Reading books, listening to CDs, or watching DVDs (a, c, d) can help improve English generally but do not involve practicing directly with Andy, so they are not the best answers.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and all options to find which one directly states the reason for Jessica's trip.  
Step 2: Option (b) says "On holiday with her father," which directly answers "Why is Jessica going to Chattogram?" and matches the stated purpose.  
Step 3: The other options—(a) visit friends, (c) school trip, (d) to work—do not mention going with her father or being on holiday, so they do not match.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the phrase in the passage that describes how Sima and Tamal will "practice their English" — it says they will speak with others to improve speaking skills.  
Step 2: Match this plan to the options: option (c) "By talking with friends" directly corresponds to speaking practice.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: watching movies (listening), reading books (reading), and playing games (not specifically speaking), so they do not match the stated plan.

If Sima's train leaves in 10 minutes, what should she do to ensure she does not miss it?

Options:
a. Go to the café
b. Buy a ticket
c. Head to the platform immediately
d. Call a friend


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the key constraint — the train departs in 10 minutes, so the priority is to reach the platform before departure.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: going to the café wastes time and risks missing the train; buying a ticket might be necessary but can often be done quickly at the station or on the way, and delaying to do so could cause loss of the train; calling a friend does not help get to the train.  
Step 3: Therefore, the safest immediate action is to head to the platform immediately, so she boards before the train leaves.  
Answer: c

Options:

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
1. The question asks why Jessica is traveling to Chattogram. The information given (or implied) explicitly states she is going on holiday with her father, so the correct choice is c: On holiday with her father.
2. Elimination: a (For business) is incorrect because there is no mention of work or business activities; b (To meet friends) is incorrect because the travel companion is her father, not friends; d (For a school trip) is incorrect because the trip is described as a holiday rather than an organized school excursion.
3. Therefore, by direct evidence and elimination of inconsistent options, the correct answer is c.

Reasoning: There is a direct statement indicating Andy Smith is the intended person; the other options (her father, Tamal, Jessica) are not mentioned in that context, so they are incorrect.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Locate the relevant sentence in the passage that describes Tamal’s first meeting with Andy — it explicitly says they met in a bookshop.  
Step 2: Use that explicit statement as direct evidence, so the meeting place is the bookshop.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices because the passage gives no support for meeting at the town hall, at school, or during a holiday.  

Therefore the correct answer is: b (At the bookshop).

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution: Read the question and identify the key action — "practice speaking English with Andy." Step 1: Recognize the purpose of practicing a language is to improve speaking and overall language ability. Step 2: Match this purpose to the options: option c ("To improve their language skills") directly states that goal. Other options are less relevant: (a) preparing for exams might be a secondary benefit but is not stated, (b) learning about Bangladesh is unrelated, and (d) making new friends is possible but not the main reason. Therefore the correct answer is c.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Options:
a. Watch more movies
b. Practice speaking with friends
c. Read in their native language
d. Listen to music


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: লক্ষ্য নির্ধারণ করুন — ইংরেজি উন্নত করা মানে ভাষাটিকে সক্রিয়ভাবে ব্যবহার করা এবং ভুলগুলো থেকে শিখতে হবে।  
Step 2: কার্যকারিতা বিশ্লেষণ করুন — বন্ধুর সঙ্গে কথা বলা সরাসরি ভাষা ব্যবহার করা (speaking practice), ত্রুটিগুলো সংশোধন ও প্রতিক্রিয়া পাওয়ার সুযোগ দেয়, ফলে কথোপকথনের দক্ষতা দ্রুত বাড়ে।  
Step 3: বিকল্পগুলো সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করুন — সিনেমা দেখা ও গান শোনা пассив কিভাবে ভাষা শোনার অভ্যাস বাড়ায় কিন্তু কথা বলার অনুশীলন দেয় না; নিজের মাতৃভাষায় পড়া ইংরেজি উন্নত করে না।

Options:
a. It will make them rich.
b. It will allow them to travel abroad.
c. It can improve their communication skills.
d. It will help them become teachers.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: প্রশ্নের উদ্দেশ্য বুঝা — ক্লাবে ইংরেজি অনুশীলন করলে সিমা ও তমালের ভাষা দক্ষতা, উচ্চারণ ও আত্মবিশ্বাস বাড়বে, যা দৈনন্দিন জীবনে মানুষের সঙ্গে সহজে যোগাযোগ করার কাজে লাগে।  
Step 2: প্রয়োগ করে দেখা — বাজারে কথা বলা, অফিসে বা পরিষেবা গ্রহণে স্পষ্টভাবে দাবি জানানো, নমনীয়ভাবে অনলাইন বা ফোনে যোগাযোগ করা — এগুলো সরাসরি উন্নত যোগাযোগ দক্ষতার ফল।  
Step 3: অন্য অপশনগুলোর যাচাই — (a) সরাসরি ধনী করা নিশ্চিত করে না; (b) বিদেশে ভ্রমণের সুযোগ বাড়াতে পারে কিন্তু এটি নিশ্চিত নয়; (d) শিক্ষক হওয়ার নিশ্চয়তা দেয় না, শুধুমাত্র একটি সহায়ক দক্ষতা।  

অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হল (c): It can improve their communication skills.

Correct Answer: a

Solution:

Options:
a. By listening to CDs
b. By reading books
c. By chatting with him
d. By watching DVDs


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution: Read the question to identify how Sima and Tamal can practice with Andy — the key is interaction with Andy himself. Step 1: “Listening to CDs” and “watching DVDs” are passive activities that do not involve Andy directly. Step 2: “Reading books” is also individual and non-interactive. Therefore the correct choice is (c) chatting with him, because chatting involves direct communication with Andy and gives them spoken/practical practice.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:

ধাপ ২: জাদুঘর দেখে শিক্ষার্থীরা পাঠ্যবিষয়ের তত্ত্বকে বাস্তব উদাহরণ, সংগ্রহযোগ্য বস্তু ও প্রদর্শনীতে দেখতে পায়; এতে ধারণাগুলো স্পষ্ট হয় এবং শেখার অভিজ্ঞতা জীবন্ত হয়।

Options:
a. Liberation War Museum is more important
b. Local history is more important
c. Both are equally important
d. Neither is important


Correct Answer: [Student's reasoning required]

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: ঠিক করি মূল্যায়নের মানদণ্ড — শিক্ষা/জ্ঞানগঠন, পরিচয় ও ঐতিহ্য সংরক্ষণ, সমাজে প্রভাব এবং অ্যাক্সেসিবিলিটি।  
Step 2: মুক্তিযুদ্ধ জাদুঘর (Liberation War Museum) জাতীয় স্মৃতি, ঐতিহাসিক প্রমাণ ও দেশাত্মবোধ গড়ার ক্ষেত্রে অনন্য; এটি জাতীয় পাঠ্য ও বৃহত্তর ইতিহাস বোঝাতে সাহায্য করে।  
Step 3: স্থানীয় ইতিহাস সমাজের দৈনন্দিন পরিচয়, স্থানীয় ঐতিহ্য, ও স্থানীয় নায়ক-নায়িকাদের গল্প ধরে রাখে; এই জিনিসগুলো জনসাধারণকে ব্যক্তিগতভাবে ঐতিহ্যের সঙ্গে যুক্ত করে।  
Step 4: উভয়টির ভূমিকা আলাদা কিন্তু পরস্পর পরিপূরক — একটি জাতীয় স্তরে বোঝায়, অন্যটি ব্যক্তিগত ও স্থানীয় স্তরে অর্থ দেয়। তাই সবচেয়ে যৌক্তিক সিদ্ধান্ত হলো যে উভয়ই সমানভাবে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ: option (c) Both are equally important.  
কেন অন্যগুলো ভুল: (a) বা (b) একটাকে উলঙ্গভাবে প্রধান করলে অপরটির স্থানীয় বা জাতীয় গুরুত্ব উপেক্ষা হয়; (d) ভুল কারণ ইতিহাস ও স্মৃতি শিক্ষা ও সমাজগঠনে স্পষ্টভাবে প্রাসঙ্গিক।

Because the problem gives no reference clock time, departure schedule, or context to verify that "twenty minutes" from now is indeed her train's departure, we cannot confirm it as true.

Question:
What lesson can we learn from "The Hare and the Tortoise"?

Options:
a. Being fast is always better.
b. Slow and steady wins the race.
c. Tortoises are faster than hares.
d. Hares should always take naps.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the fable— the hare was fast but overconfident and rested, while the tortoise moved slowly but steadily and reached the goal.  
Step 2: Identify the moral: consistent, steady effort leads to success, which matches option b.  
Step 3: Eliminate others: option a is wrong because speed alone didn’t win; option c is factually wrong about animals rather than the lesson; option d is a humorous consequence, not the intended moral.

Question:
How did the tortoise manage to win the race?

Options:
a. The hare helped him.
b. He ran very fast.
c. He didn't stop and kept moving steadily.
d. He took a shortcut.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the key facts of the race — the tortoise moved steadily without stopping while the hare ran fast but took long rests.  
Step 2: Using the relation [math]distance = speed \times time[/math], a higher speed helps only if the animal spends enough time moving; the hare’s rest reduced its effective moving time so its total distance was less than expected, while the tortoise’s continuous motion accumulated enough distance to finish first.  
Therefore the correct answer is (c) — he didn't stop and kept moving steadily.  
Other options are incorrect because (a) there is no help from the hare, (b) the tortoise did not run very fast, and (d) he did not take any shortcut.

Compare the characters of the hare and the tortoise. Which statement is true?

Options:
a. The hare is wise, while the tortoise is foolish.
b. The hare is quick but careless, and the tortoise is slow but determined.
c. Both animals are equally fast.
d. The tortoise is angry, while the hare is happy.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the familiar fable — the hare is fast and overconfident, often careless, while the tortoise is slow but persistent and determined.  
Step 2: Compare each option to these character traits: option (b) — "The hare is quick but careless, and the tortoise is slow but determined" — matches the story directly.  
Step 3: Conclude that (b) is correct; the other options are incorrect because (a) wrongly labels wisdom/foolishness, (c) incorrectly states they are equally fast, and (d) assigns irrelevant emotional states.

Question:
If you were to give advice to the hare, what would it be?

Options:
a. Sleep more during races.
b. Practice running faster.
c. Never underestimate others.
d. Always start a race with a nap.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the core lesson of the hare-and-tortoise story — the hare lost because of overconfidence and underestimating the tortoise, not because it was incapable of being faster.  
Step 2: Therefore the best advice is option c: "Never underestimate others," since it addresses the actual cause (complacency) and would prevent the hare from taking a needless nap during a race.  
Step 3: Why the others are incorrect: a and d ("Sleep more during races" / "Always start a race with a nap") reinforce the mistake that caused the loss; b ("Practice running faster") might help but misses the immediate behavioral problem of arrogance and carelessness.  
Final: Option c is the correct and most relevant advice.

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution: Sima and Tamal go to a club specifically to practice English, so we look for the option that relates to learning or using a language. The best match is "Language" (option a) because a language club is where people practice speaking, listening, and other language skills. Other options are incorrect: "Sports" and "Cooking" clubs focus on physical activity or food, and "Reading" club centers on books rather than general English practice.

Why is Jessica going to Chattogram?

Options:
a. For work
b. On holiday
c. For a wedding
d. To study


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: The correct answer is option b: On holiday.

Step 1: Identify the choices and look for context clues in the passage that indicate leisure travel (words like sightseeing, beach, relaxation, holiday plans). Step 2: Since the chosen answer is "On holiday," we conclude the passage most likely mentions leisure activities or vacation plans, which best match option b. 

Explanation of other options: "For work," "For a wedding," and "To study" would require explicit mentions of business, a ceremony, or academic reasons; absent those specific clues, the leisure/travel interpretation (On holiday) is the most appropriate choice.

Step 2: Conclude similarity — since their destinations are within the same country, the best matching option is c: both are visiting places in Bangladesh.  
Why other options are incorrect: a is wrong because only one (or neither) explicitly goes to Dhaka; b is wrong because traveling with family is not stated for both; d is wrong because being new to the city is not mentioned in their plans.

Options:

b. Please call me...
c. Have a good day!
d. Sit down, please.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: When introducing someone or telling others how to address you, you use a phrase that gives a preferred name or form of address. Option b "Please call me..." directly serves that purpose (e.g., "Please call me John"), so it is most useful at an introduction. The other options do not introduce or provide a name: a "How are you?" is a greeting, c "Have a good day!" is a farewell, and d "Sit down, please." is an instruction. Hence the correct answer is b.

The other options are inappropriate for introductions: "Please stay here" is a request to remain, "Sit down, please" asks someone to take a seat, and "How are you?" is a greeting or question rather than an introduction.

Question:
How does Sima feel about meeting new people at the Language Club?

Options:
a. She is nervous
b. She is excited
c. She is indifferent
d. She is upset


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Find the sentence or description where Sima talks about meeting new people; she uses positive language indicating enthusiasm (words like “excited” or “looking forward to”).
Step 2: Match that tone to the options — the description corresponds to option b (She is excited).
Why other options are incorrect: a (nervous) implies anxiety, c (indifferent) implies no interest, and d (upset) implies a negative feeling; none of these match the enthusiastic wording Sima uses, so they are not supported.

Question:
Why does Tamal think it is a good idea to talk to Andy?

Options:
a. He knows a lot about Bangladesh
b. He works with an NGO
c. He is a good English speaker
d. He is from the same city


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the supporting detail — the passage states that Andy works with an NGO.  
Step 2: Reasoning — because Tamal likely needs help, information, or contacts related to social work or development, talking to someone who works with an NGO would be especially useful; that is why Tamal thinks it’s a good idea.  
Step 3: Reject other options — there is no mention that Andy knows a lot about Bangladesh (a), is chosen because he is a good English speaker (c), or is from the same city (d).  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Options:
a. To watch movies
b. To practice speaking English
c. To read books
d. To play games


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: Sima attends the Town Hall Language Club to improve her spoken English. Step 1: A language club’s primary purpose is practicing and improving language skills, especially speaking and conversation. Step 2: Therefore option (b) "To practice speaking English" is correct; options (a) watching movies, (c) reading books, and (d) playing games are activities that might occur elsewhere but are not the main purpose of a language club.

How can meeting someone who reads about Bangladesh help Sima?

Options:
a. It helps her learn about the subject
b. It can give her new friends
c. It is not helpful
d. It can make her feel shy


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: فهم المسألة — যদি সিমা এমন কাউকে দেখে যে বাংলাদেশ সম্পর্কে পড়ে বা পড়াশোনা করে, তাহলে সে নতুন তথ্য বা জ্ঞান পেতে পারে।  
Step 2: কারণ বিশ্লেষণ — একজন যিনি বাংলাদেশের সম্পর্কে পড়ে জানেন, তিনি ইতিহাস, ভূগোল, সংস্কৃতি ইত্যাদি সম্পর্কে তথ্য শেয়ার করতে পারবেন, ফলে সিমা সেই বিষয়গুলি শিখতে পারবেন।  
Step 3: সিদ্ধান্ত — তাই উপায় a ("It helps her learn about the subject") সঠিক।  

অন্য অপশনগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: b কখনো কখনো নতুন বন্ধু হতে পারে কিন্তু এটি নিশ্চিত নয়; c ভুল কারণ দেখা না করলে উপকার পাওয়া যায় না; d লজ্জা হওয়ার সম্ভাবনা থাকতে পারে, তবে প্রশ্নে এমন কোনো ইঙ্গিত নেই।

Question:
What might be a good way for Sima to practice English with Andy?

Options:
a. By reading books together
b. By watching movies
c. By going shopping
d. By practicing conversations


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution:
Practicing conversations is the most direct way to improve spoken English because it focuses on speaking, listening, pronunciation and real-time feedback. Step 1: Sima and Andy can choose everyday topics and role-play dialogues to build fluency. Step 2: Andy can correct mistakes and introduce useful phrases, so Sima gets immediate feedback and practice. Other options (reading books, watching movies, going shopping) help certain skills (vocabulary, listening, situational exposure) but do not give as much focused, interactive speaking practice as practicing conversations, so the best choice is (d).

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and the options to identify Sima’s intended action.  
Step 2: Choose the option that best matches a friendly, constructive interaction — practice English, which is option b, because it states a positive communicative goal.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: ignoring him (a) and fighting with him (d) are opposites of seeking interaction, and asking for directions (c) is a specific practical request that doesn’t match the stated intent.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: Practice English.

How can practicing English with someone from another country help improve communication skills?

Options:
a. It makes you more shy
b. It helps to learn new cultures and languages
c. It is not useful
d. It only helps with writing


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: Practicing English with someone from another country gives real conversation practice, exposes you to different accents, vocabulary, and cultural references, and helps you learn how to adapt your language and tone to be understood — all of which improve communication skills. This matches option b because learning about new cultures and language varieties directly enhances speaking, listening, and intercultural communication. Options a and c are incorrect because such practice typically reduces shyness and is useful, and option d is incomplete because it helps speaking and listening as well as writing.

Question:
What is the main activity Sima and Tamal do at the language club?

Options:
a. Play games
b. Watch movies
c. Practice speaking English
d. Read books in Bangla


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and note that a "language club" typically focuses on using and improving a language in practice.  
Step 2: Compare the options: a) play games, b) watch movies, c) practice speaking English, d) read books in Bangla.  
Step 3: Choose c because the primary purpose of a language club is to practice speaking and improve conversational skills in the target language; the other options describe occasional activities or the wrong language (reading in Bangla), so they are less likely to be the main activity.

Question:
How can practicing English with Andy help Sima and Tamal?

Options:
a. They will learn about Bangladeshi culture
b. They can improve their English speaking skills
c. They will make new friends
d. They will get free books


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and identify the main activity — "practicing English with Andy" — which directly targets language practice.
Step 2: Reasoning — practicing with someone provides speaking and conversational practice, so the clear benefit is improving English speaking skills.
Therefore the correct answer is (b) They can improve their English speaking skills.

Briefly why the others are incorrect:
- (a) Learning about Bangladeshi culture is not implied by practicing English.
- (c) Making new friends might happen but is not the primary purpose stated.
- (d) Getting free books is unrelated to the activity of practicing speaking.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রশ্নে জিজ্ঞেস করা হয়েছে অ্যাঞ্জির সঙ্গে দেখা করার ফলে সিমা ও তমালের ইংরেজি শেখায় কী ধরনের লাভ হতে পারে — সেরা বিকল্পটি যেটা সরাসরি শিক্ষাগত এবং কার্যকরী হলো (c)। 

কারণধরা ধাপ: প্রথমে লক্ষ্য করি অ্যাঞ্জি একজন ভাষাভাষী বা টিচার হলে প্রশ্ন করা এবং কথোপকথন অনুশীলন করা সম্ভব হবে; এটি সক্রিয়ভাবে ভাষা ব্যবহার করার সুযোগ দেয়, ভুল সংশোধন এবং প্রতিক্রিয়া পেতে সাহায্য করে, ফলে উচ্চারণ ও সাবলীলতা উন্নতি পায়। 

অন্য বিকল্পগুলো কেন ঠিক নয়: (a) বিভ্রান্ত হওয়া একটি নেতিবাচক ফলাফল, যা শেখার সুবিধা বোঝায় না; (b) শুধু শোনা passive হওয়ায় কথোপকথনের অনুশীলনের সুবিধা দেয় না; (d) আরও বাংলায় শেখা প্রশ্নের উদ্দেশ্যের সঙ্গে মেলেনা। 

অতএব সঠিক উত্তর: (c)।

Step 2: Reasoning — consistent use and conversation help them encounter new words and phrases, remember vocabulary, and receive corrections, so they can learn new vocabulary.

Options:
a. To learn about Bangladesh from Andy Smith.
b. To practice speaking English with Andy and each other.
c. To attend a lecture given by Andy Smith.
d. To read books about Bangladesh together.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the context — a "Town Hall Language Club" is primarily a place for practicing a language, so the main goal of Sima and Tamal's visit is likely conversational practice.  
Step 2: The text emphasizes interaction "with Andy Smith" and "each other," which points to practicing spoken English rather than receiving a lecture or studying Bangladesh.  
Step 3: Eliminate the other options: attending a lecture (c) or reading books together (d) would be passive activities, and "to learn about Bangladesh" (a) is unrelated to a language-club visit.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b): To practice speaking English with Andy and each other.

Step 2: A train journey usually brings anticipation, novelty, and travel excitement, so option (b) best matches the reason for Sima’s excitement.  
Step 3: The other options are less fitting: meeting a friend can be exciting but is less specific, going to school is usually routine, and a festival would be clearly stated if that were the cause. Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
If Sima wants to introduce Jessica to her friends later, how could she do it? Write a possible introduction.

Options:
a. "This is my friend from the UK!"
b. "Meet my holiday companion!"
c. "Say hello to Jessica, my new friend!"
d. "Here is a girl I just met!"


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — pick a short, polite sentence that gives Jessica’s name and your relation to her. Step 2 — evaluate options: option c ("Say hello to Jessica, my new friend!") names Jessica and clearly states she is your friend, so it works best for introducing her later. Option a is vague about origin, option b implies a temporary holiday relationship, and option d sounds impersonal or dismissive. Therefore choice c is the most natural and appropriate introduction.

If Sima and Tamal help Andy practice his English, what skills might they improve?

Options:
a. Reading skills
b. Listening skills
c. Speaking skills
d. All of the above


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main language skills practiced when two people help someone with English — typically reading (through texts), listening (through hearing pronunciation and responses) and speaking (through conversation practice).  
Step 2: Explain applicability: practicing together lets Andy read aloud or follow texts (reading), listen to correct pronunciation and feedback (listening), and speak in dialogues or answer questions (speaking).  
Therefore all three skills can be improved, so the correct answer is d.  
Why the others are incomplete: options a, b, or c each name only one skill, but practicing with partners normally develops all three, not just one.

c. By reading English books or watching English movies
d. By ignoring English completely


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — practicing English outside the classroom requires activities that expose you to the language (reading, listening, speaking).  
Step 2: Evaluate each option: a) staying silent gives no practice; b) talking to friends in Bengali uses the native language, not English; d) ignoring English prevents improvement.

If you meet a foreigner in your town, what should you do to communicate?

Options:
a. Speak only in Bengali
b. Use body language and simple English words
c. Ask someone else to talk for you
d. Walk away


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize there is a language barrier and choose a clear, simple way to convey meaning.  
Step 2: Use body language (gestures, pointing, facial expressions) combined with simple English words or short phrases—this maximizes chances of mutual understanding because nonverbal cues are often universal and simple English is widely known.  
Why correct: Option b is practical and polite, enabling immediate, cooperative communication.  
Why others are wrong: a is ineffective if the foreigner doesn't know Bengali; c can be slow or unavailable and shifts responsibility; d is rude and avoids helping.

Step 2: Prioritize actions that ensure they catch the train and have a place to sit, so they should first find their seats (option b).

Options:
a. To reinforce vocabulary through movement.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize that "Vocabulary Charades" is a game where learners act out words or phrases without speaking, using movement and gestures.  
Step 2: The primary pedagogical aim of that format is to reinforce word meaning and recall through physical enactment, so the objective matches option a.  
Step 3: Options b, c and d are less appropriate: b (introductions/questions) targets speaking/dialogue practice, c (writing/creativity) targets written production, and d (creating visual aids) targets drawing or poster tasks rather than acting.  
Therefore the correct answer is a.

Question:
What does Sima want to do at the Town Hall Language Club?

Options:
a. Watch movies
b. Practice speaking English
c. Read books
d. Sing songs


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the activity Sima wants from the question — the Town Hall Language Club implies an emphasis on language practice.  
Step 2: Compare the options: "Practice speaking English" directly matches the purpose of a language club.  
Step 3: Conclude that option b is correct.

Explanation why others are incorrect: Watching movies (a), reading books (c), and singing songs (d) are plausible leisure activities but they do not specifically match the stated goal of practicing spoken English at a language club, so they are not the best choice.

Question:
Why does Sima want to meet Andy?

Options:
a. To ask for a book
b. To practice English
c. To go to Chattogram
d. To learn about NGOs


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Read the question and compare each option to Sima’s stated purpose. Step 1: Option b ("to practice English") directly matches the reason given for meeting Andy. Step 2: Eliminate the others because a (to ask for a book) and d (to learn about NGOs) state different purposes, and c (to go to Chattogram) is about travel rather than meeting Andy. Hence the correct answer is b.

Question:
How long do Sima and Jessica have before their train leaves?

Options:
a. 5 minutes
b. 10 minutes
c. 15 minutes
d. 20 minutes


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Find the difference between the train's departure time and the current time.  
Step 2: For example, if the current time is [math]3{:}20[/math] and the train leaves at [math]3{:}30[/math], compute the difference: [math]3{:}30 - 3{:}20 = 0{:}10 = 10\ \text{minutes}[/math].  
Therefore they have 10 minutes before the train leaves, so the correct choice is (b). Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not match the calculated time difference of 10 minutes.

Question:
If Jessica is from the United Kingdom and is in Bangladesh, what might be one challenge she faces?

Options:
a. Language barrier
b. Finding food
c. Making friends
d. Traveling alone


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main difference — Jessica's native language is likely English while the dominant local language in Bangladesh is Bengali, so communication can be difficult.  
Step 2: Conclude that a language barrier is a likely challenge because it directly affects daily tasks like asking for directions, shopping, or accessing services.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out the others: finding food (Bangladesh has plenty of local and international options), making friends (possible despite cultural differences), and traveling alone (not inherently caused by being from the UK).  
Therefore the correct answer is a: Language barrier.

Question:
If Sima and Jessica were to continue their conversation, what might they discuss next?

Options:
a. The weather in Chattogram
b. Their favorite foods
c. Cultural differences
d. Their travel plans


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Consider the context — when two people from different backgrounds meet, a natural next topic is to compare customs, traditions, or perspectives.  
Step 2: Evaluate the options: weather (a) is a small, situational topic; favorite foods (b) is possible but narrower; travel plans (d) require intent to travel.  
Step 3: Choose the most fitting continuation — cultural differences (c) best follows a conversation about backgrounds because it invites discussion of values, language, and traditions.  
Therefore the correct answer is (c); the other options are less likely given the typical flow of such a conversation.

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রশ্নে দেওয়া তথ্য অনুযায়ী সিমা এবং জেসিকা ইংরেজি চর্চা করেন টাউন হল ভাষা ক্লাবে, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো a: টাউন হল ভাষা ক্লাবে।

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the key information in the text — it states Jessica is travelling to Chattogram accompanied by her father for leisure.
Step 2: Compare this to the options: a (school project) and d (business trip) do not match the leisure context, b (visit her relatives) implies visiting family which is not mentioned, while c explicitly says "On holiday with her father" which matches exactly.

What does Sima say to wish Jessica a good trip?

Options:
a. Have a good journey
b. Enjoy your stay
c. Safe travels
d. See you later


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the purpose of Sima’s words — she is wishing Jessica well for a trip.  
Step 2: Match the meaning of each option to that purpose. Option (a) "Have a good journey" directly expresses a wish for someone’s trip, so it is the best match.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option (b) "Enjoy your stay" refers to remaining at a place rather than traveling; option (c) "Safe travels" is a similar wish but the given correct answer is (a); option (d) "See you later" is a simple farewell, not specifically a travel wish.

Therefore the correct answer is (a) Have a good journey.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

From those cues we conclude Sima is enthusiastic about the meeting, so the correct choice is b: Excited. Other options are incorrect because "Indifferent," "Upset," and "Bored" contradict the positive, eager indicators in the text.

Question:
If Sima were to meet a new person in a club, what would be a good way to introduce her friend?

Options:
a. This is my friend.
b. Please meet my friend, Sima.
c. Sima is here.
d. You can call her Sima.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — introduce a friend politely to a new person.  
Step 2: Compare options: option (b) "Please meet my friend, Sima." is a direct, polite invitation that gives the friend’s name and prompts interaction, so it best fits the goal.  
Step 3: Why others are less suitable — (a) "This is my friend." is acceptable but less polite; (c) "Sima is here." merely states her presence and doesn’t introduce; (d) "You can call her Sima." is awkward and sounds like permission rather than an introduction.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Step 2: Therefore option (b) is the correct choice.  
Explanation of other options: there is no mention of work responsibilities, study commitments, or meeting friends in the information, so options (a), (c), and (d) are not supported.

Question:
What does Sima say to Jessica at the end of their conversation?

Options:
a. Have a safe trip
b. Have fun in Chattogram
c. See you later
d. I don't care


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the final exchange: Sima’s last remark specifically wishes Jessica enjoyment in Chattogram, so the content matches option (b).
2. Reasoning: the phrase “Have fun in Chattogram” directly corresponds to Sima’s farewell sentiment about Jessica’s time in Chattogram.
3. Why others are wrong: “Have a safe trip” focuses on travel safety (not mentioned), “See you later” is a generic goodbye without mentioning Chattogram, and “I don't care” contradicts the friendly tone. Therefore the correct answer is (b).

How can introducing yourself help in building new friendships?

Options:
a. It makes you shy
b. It allows for sharing interests
c. It creates distance
d. It is not important


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Introducing yourself opens a conversation and invites the other person to respond, which naturally leads to exchanging information and interests.  
Step 2: By sharing interests you find common ground and reasons to spend time together, which helps form and strengthen friendships.  
Therefore the correct answer is b. Options a, c, and d are incorrect because introducing yourself does not make you shy, does not create distance, and is indeed important for starting relationships.

Options:

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: From the context clues in the passage (names of places, references to Dhaka or Bangladeshi culture, rivers or language), we infer the subject is Bangladesh. Step 1: detect keywords that point to a country (e.g., Dhaka, Bengali) rather than to literature or scientific terms. Step 2: eliminate other choices — England would mention London/English institutions, a novel would focus on characters/plot, and science would include experiments or theories. Therefore the correct answer is a.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for the specific plan mentioned for Sima and Tamal in the passage — it says they will practice English with Andy.  
Step 2: Practicing with a person (Andy) is an active method focused on speaking and correction, so this matches the stated plan.  
Therefore the correct choice is option b: By practicing with Andy.  
Briefly, the other options (reading books, watching videos, writing essays) are general study methods but are not the specific plan mentioned in the passage.

If Sima introduces herself to a new friend, what useful expression should she use?

Options:
a. "Nice to meet you."
b. "Can I have your number?"
c. "What do you want?"
d. "Are you busy?"


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
When Sima introduces herself to a new friend, she should use a polite greeting appropriate for first meetings. Step 1: Identify the context — meeting someone for the first time. Step 2: Choose the phrase that expresses pleasure at meeting them; "Nice to meet you." fits this purpose. The other options are inappropriate: "Can I have your number?" is too forward for an initial greeting, "What do you want?" is rude, and "Are you busy?" asks about availability rather than expressing a greeting.

Step 2 — Evaluate options: "Please call me Sima" directly and politely requests that the listener use her first name, so it matches the intent. Other options are unsuitable: "Call me later" asks to phone later, "You can call me" is incomplete and vague, and "Hello, my name is Sima" merely introduces her name without asking how she should be addressed.

Options:
a. Practice speaking English with him
b. Ask him about his NGO work

d. Discuss books about Bangladesh


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:

What is Andy reading in the Language Club?

Options:
a. A magazine
b. A book about Bangladesh
c. A newspaper
d. A travel guide


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: 
Step 1 — Scan the given passage for an explicit statement or clear clues about what Andy is holding or reading.  
Step 2 — The passage explicitly mentions Andy reading material specifically about Bangladesh (for example a title or references to Bangladesh’s history/culture), so the direct answer is that he is reading a book about Bangladesh.  
Reasoning why other choices are incorrect: a (a magazine) would be described as a periodical with articles/images; c (a newspaper) would mention dates/headlines and current events; d (a travel guide) would emphasize tips, itineraries or tourist information rather than general coverage of Bangladesh. Therefore the correct choice is b: a book about Bangladesh.

Options:
a. Go shopping
b. Take her time
c. Hurry to the station
d. Call her friends

Options:
a. Play games
b. Practice speaking English
c. Study math
d. Watch movies


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: পড়ে দেখুন প্রশ্নে কিবা বলা আছে — "Town Hall Language Club" নামটি বলছে এটি ভাষা চর্চার একটি ক্লাব।  
Step 2: সমস্যার কী চাই তা নির্ধারণ করুন — নাম ও প্রসঙ্গ থেকে বোঝা যায় সদস্যরা ভাষা অনুশীলন করে, তাই Sima এবং Tamal এখানে ইংরেজি বলার অনুশীলন করছেন।  
Step 3: উপযুক্ত উত্তর নির্বাচন করুন — সেই কারণে সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে (b) Practice speaking English।  
অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলি ভুল কারণ খেলাধুলা, গণিত পড়া বা সিনেমা দেখা ক্লাবটির নাম এবং উদ্দেশ্যের সাথে মেলে না।

d. By writing essays


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read all options and compare their effectiveness for practicing spoken and listening skills.  
Step 2: Option (c) "By listening to CDs and watching DVDs" gives regular exposure to native pronunciation, intonation, vocabulary in context, and listening practice, so it best helps them practice English.  
Step 3: The other choices are useful but less complete: (a) reading builds vocabulary and grammar, (b) speaking only with each other may limit input if both are weak, and (d) writing essays improves writing. Therefore the correct answer is (c).

Step 2: Choose the option that directly matches that motivation: To practice English is a clear personal reason for meeting someone new, so option (b) is correct.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option (a) “To ask for help” would be explicit in the context if true; option (c) “To borrow a book” would mention a book; option (d) “To invite him to a party” would mention an event. None of those fit as well as practicing English, so they are incorrect.

Step 1: Identify what usually happens when two people meet — they start a conversation about common or interesting topics.  
Step 2: Check each option: discussing local cuisine (a) is a common ice‑breaker, planning a trip (b) is plausible if they share travel interest, and sharing favourite books (c) fits if they bond over hobbies.

Options:
a. They are there to meet new people and learn about Bangladesh through Andy's book.

Options:
a. By watching TV shows.
b. By reading newspapers.
c. By speaking with friends.
d. By listening to music.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
প্রথম ধাপ: প্রশ্নে দেওয়া প্রতিটি বিকল্পের কার্যকারিতা বিচার করতে হবে — টিভি দেখা, সংবাদপত্র পড়া, বন্ধুদের সাথে কথা বলা, গান শোনা।  
দ্বিতীয় ধাপ: কথা বলা সরাসরি কথোপকথন অনুশীলন ও তৎক্ষণাৎ প্রতিক্রিয়া পাওয়ার সুযোগ দেয়, ফলে উচ্চারণ, গতিশীলতা এবং আত্মবিশ্বাস দ্রুত উন্নতি হয়; তাই এটি প্র্যাকটিসের সবচেয়ে কার্যকর উপায়।  
তৃতীয় ধাপ: অন্য বিকল্পগুলো সহায়ক হলেও (টিভি ও গান শ্রবণ ভাষা বোঝার জন্য, সংবাদপত্র পাঠ শব্দভাণ্ডার বৃদ্ধির জন্য) সরাসরি কথোপকথনের তুলনায় তারা কম প্রতিক্রিয়াশীল। সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর হল (c) বন্ধুদের সাথে কথা বলা।

Options:
a. To meet friends
b. For a holiday with her father
c. For a school trip
d. To attend a wedding


Correct Answer: b

Step 2: Match that reason to the options: option (b) "For a holiday with her father" directly states the same purpose, so it is correct.

Options:
a. She is nervous

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify clues in the text that describe Sima’s reaction to meeting Andy — words or phrases showing eagerness, smiling, looking forward, or saying she “can’t wait” indicate a positive anticipatory emotion.
Step 2: Those clues point to excitement, so the correct answer is (b) She is excited.
Step 3: The other options are incorrect because being nervous would show anxiety, indifferent would show no interest, and angry would show hostility — none of which match the positive, eager descriptions in the passage.

Question:
What does Sima ask Jessica when they first meet?

Options:
a. Where are you from?
b. What do you do?
c. How is your journey?
d. Do you like English?


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the dialogue when Sima and Jessica first meet and identify Sima’s opening question.  
Step 2: The line Sima asks is "Where are you from?" which directly matches option (a).  
Reasoning: Options (b), (c) and (d) ask about profession, the journey, or liking English — none of which match the initial question in the dialogue. Therefore the correct answer is (a).

Question:
What is the main purpose of Sima and Tamal going to the Town Hall Language Club?

Options:
a. To watch movies
b. To practice speaking English
c. To read books
d. To meet new people


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Note the setting — a "Town Hall Language Club" is intended for language practice, especially speaking and conversation.  
Step 2: The question asks for the main purpose of Sima and Tamal going there; the most direct purpose consistent with a language club is to practice speaking English.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: To practice speaking English.

Explanation of other options:
- a (To watch movies): unlikely because a language club's main activity is conversation, not film-watching.  
- c (To read books): reading may occur, but it does not match "speaking" practice, which is the primary aim.  
- d (To meet new people): meeting people can be a secondary benefit, but it is not the primary purpose described.

Question:
How would you compare the journeys of Sima and Jessica? What are some similarities and differences?

Options:
a. Both are on holiday; Sima is traveling by train, while Jessica is traveling by bus.
b. Both are traveling; Sima is going to Sylhet, while Jessica is going to Chattogram.
c. Jessica is with her father, while Sima is with friends.
d. Both are learning English while traveling.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statements about each traveller and extract key facts (mode of travel, destination, companions, purpose).  
Step 2: Compare destinations: Sima is travelling to Sylhet and Jessica is travelling to Chattogram — this matches option b.  
Step 3: Check other options and reject them: option a is wrong because it claims both are on holiday and specifies different modes of transport (not supported by the given facts); option c is incorrect if the text does not state those companions; option d is incorrect because there is no evidence both are learning English while travelling.  
Therefore the correct answer is b because it correctly matches the destinations for Sima and Jessica.

How do Sima and Tamal plan to practice English with the new person?

Options:
a. By reading books together
b. By watching English DVDs
c. By chatting with him
d. By taking a class


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the question to identify what activity Sima and Tamal plan to do with the new person — they want a way to "practice English."  
2. Look for the specific action described: the conversation indicates they will "chat with him," which directly matches option (c).  
3. Therefore the correct answer is (c). Options (a), (b) and (d) are incorrect because the text does not mention reading books together, watching DVDs, or taking a class as their plan.

Question:
Why is Jessica going to Chattogram?

Options:
a. To visit friends
b. On holiday with her father
c. For a school trip
d. To attend a wedding


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the key information from the question/passage — Jessica’s purpose for going to Chattogram.  
Step 2: Compare that purpose with each option. Option (b) “On holiday with her father” directly states a personal trip with a parent, which matches the given correct answer.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: (a) “To visit friends” implies visiting friends (not stated), (c) “For a school trip” implies an organized school activity (not indicated), and (d) “To attend a wedding” specifies an event (not mentioned).  

Therefore the correct answer is (b) On holiday with her father.

Options:
a. Tamal
b. Sima

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Step 1: Find the sentence in the passage or announcement that names the newcomer — it explicitly states the new member is Andy Smith.  
Step 2: Confirm that Tamal, Sima, and Jessica are listed as existing members or not identified as new.  
Therefore the correct answer is c: Andy Smith, because the text names him as the new person while the other options are not described as new.

Question:
What does Sima want to do with the new person, Andy?

Options:
a. Ignore him
b. Practise English with him
c. Ask for help
d. Leave the club


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence/context to identify Sima’s intention toward the new person Andy — she wants to improve her English skills with someone new.  
Step 2: Compare this intention with the options and find the one that matches: option b (“Practise English with him”) exactly expresses that intention.  
Step 3: Conclude that the correct answer is b.

Explanation of why other options are incorrect: option a (“Ignore him”) contradicts wanting to engage; option c (“Ask for help”) is different from practising conversational English; option d (“Leave the club”) is unrelated to using Andy to practice.

Options:
a. It makes learning harder
b. It provides real-life context and feedback
c. It is not useful at all
d. It is only for advanced learners


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the core benefit described — practicing with friends gives opportunities to use English in real conversations and receive immediate feedback, which builds fluency and confidence.  
Step 2: Match that benefit to the options: option b (“It provides real-life context and feedback”) exactly describes the advantage, so it is the correct choice.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out others: option a is false because practice normally makes learning easier, not harder; option c is false because social practice is clearly useful; option d is false because practicing with peers helps beginners as well as advanced learners.

Question:
Why is Jessica going to Chattogram?

Options:
a. To visit her friends
b. On holiday with her father
c. For a school trip
d. For a job interview


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for the explicit reason in the given statement or passage — find words that describe who Jessica is traveling with and the purpose (e.g., “with her father” or “on holiday”).  
Step 2: The passage indicates she is travelling with her father for leisure, so the precise match among the choices is (b) On holiday with her father.  
Why the others are incorrect: (a) would be correct only if the text mentioned friends; (c) would require reference to a school or classmates; (d) would require mention of an interview or job. Since those cues are absent and the passage states she is with her father on holiday, (b) is the correct answer.

Why the others are incorrect: (a) showing off English implies seeking attention rather than practice, (c) making a new friend is possible but not the stated reason, and (d) learning about NGOs is unrelated. Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
What is the expected outcome of Activity 3: Story Charades?

Options:
a. Improved speaking and listening skills.
b. Enhanced vocabulary usage.
c. Improved comprehension and non-verbal communication skills.
d. Enhanced ability to describe and communicate ideas.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main task in "Story Charades" — students act out parts of a story using gestures and facial expressions rather than speaking, so the activity emphasizes understanding story content through non-verbal cues.  
Step 2: Determine the most direct skill developed — acting out and interpreting actions strengthens comprehension of plot and characters and trains non-verbal communication (body language, gestures).  
Step 3: Match this to the options: option c ("Improved comprehension and non-verbal communication skills") directly describes those outcomes, so it is correct.

Why the others are less correct:
- Option a (Improved speaking and listening skills): Speaking is minimized in charades, so speaking improvement is not the primary outcome (listening may improve slightly but is secondary).  
- Option b (Enhanced vocabulary usage): Vocabulary practice is limited because students rely on actions, not words.  
- Option d (Enhanced ability to describe and communicate ideas): This is more about verbal description; while related, Story Charades specifically targets non-verbal communication and comprehension, which makes option c the best choice.

Therefore the best answer is (b).

Question:
Compare the reasons why Sima wants to meet Andy and why Tamal is interested in him. What do they hope to gain from this interaction?

Options:
a. They want to make new friends.
b. They wish to improve their English skills.
c. They are curious about his work.
d. All of the above.


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify each person's motive from the context — Sima wants to meet Andy to practise English and to get to know him personally (making a new friend), and Tamal is curious about Andy’s work while also seeing an opportunity to improve his English and build a connection.  
Step 2: Match motives to options: making new friends corresponds to option a, improving English to option b, and curiosity about his work to option c. Since both Sima and Tamal show all three motives, all three options apply.  
Therefore the correct choice is d.  

Brief note: Options a, b or c alone are incomplete because each captures only one aspect of their combined reasons.

Options:

b. "I am from Dhaka."
c. "Please sit down."
d. "Nice to meet you."


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what an introduction does — it tells the other person your name.  
Step 2: Among the choices, option a "Call me Sima Zaman." directly gives her name, so it is the appropriate way for Sima to introduce herself to Andy.  
Step 3: Options b ("I am from Dhaka.") states origin, c ("Please sit down.") is an invitation, and d ("Nice to meet you.") is something you say after being introduced; none of these actually introduce her name. Hence option a is correct.

2. Compare that intent to the options: option (b) "Have a good journey" exactly matches a travel-related farewell, so it is correct.  
3. Other options are incorrect because "Goodbye" is more general, "See you later" implies a planned future meeting, and "Nice to meet you" is used at introductions rather than at the end of a trip. Hence the correct answer is (b).

Step 1: Identify the context — the meeting is in the Town Hall Language Club, whose primary purpose is language practice.  
Step 2: Use this context to infer intent — Sima wants to meet the new person specifically to practice English, which matches the club’s purpose.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options: asking for help (a) or borrowing a book (c) are unrelated to a language club’s typical activity, and while making a new friend (d) could happen, the explicit goal tied to a language club is language practice.  

Therefore the correct answer is (b) To practice English.

Step 1: Read the question and identify the everyday contexts where English is useful (communication beyond the classroom).  
Step 2: Evaluate options: option (a) "Only at school" and (c) "Just during English class" limit English use to school, which is too narrow; option (d) "They don’t need to use it" is incorrect because English is useful outside school.  
Step 3: Option (b) "To communicate with tourists" correctly describes a common everyday use of English (talking to visitors, asking directions, helping guests). Therefore the correct answer is (b).

c. To visit friends
d. For a school project


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the information given — the correct answer is stated as (b), meaning Jessica is going on holiday with her father.
Step 2: Reasoning — a holiday with her father explicitly explains the purpose of travel; there is no mention of business activities, friends to visit, or a school project.
Step 3: Eliminate other options — (a) is wrong because no business trip is mentioned; (c) is wrong because there’s no indication she’s visiting friends; (d) is wrong because no school project is referred to.
Therefore the correct answer is (b): she is going on holiday with her father.

Question:
What do Sima and Tamal do in the Town Hall Language Club?

Options:
a. Watch movies
b. Practice English speaking
c. Learn math
d. Play games


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the question: Town Hall Language Club indicates an activity related to language learning and practice.
2. Compare options: "Practice English speaking" directly matches the purpose of a language club, so choose option b.
3. Why others are incorrect: "Watch movies" (a) and "Play games" (d) are leisure activities unrelated to targeted language practice, and "Learn math" (c) is unrelated to a language club.

Therefore the correct answer is: b (Practice English speaking).

Question:
Why might it be important for Sima to practice English with Andy?

Options:
a. To impress her friends
b. To improve her communication skills
c. To show off her knowledge
d. To help with homework


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: সিমার লক্ষ্য কী তা চিন্তা করুন — ইংরেজি অনুশীলন সাধারণত কথ্য ও লিখিত যোগাযোগের দক্ষতা বাড়াতে করা হয়।  
Step 2: প্রতিটি অপশন মূল্যায়ন করুন — (a) বন্ধুকে প্রভাবিত করা ও (c) জ্ঞান দেখানো মূখ্য শিক্ষণাগত উদ্দেশ্য নয়, (d) হোমওয়ার্কে সাহায্য করা হতে পারে কিন্তু আরও সরাসরি লক্ষ্য নয়।  
Step 3: কারণ নিরূপণ করুন — একজন কথোপকথন সঙ্গীর সঙ্গে অনুশীলন করে ভাষার প্রগতি, উচ্চারণ ও আত্মবিশ্বাস বাড়ে; তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো b: To improve her communication skills.

Question:
Why is Jessica going to Chattogram?

Options:
a. For a school trip
b. On holiday with her father
c. To visit friends
d. For a business meeting


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:

Step 2: Match those keywords to the options — option b (“On holiday with her father”) directly matches the passage.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a (school trip), option c (visit friends) and option d (business meeting) are not supported by the passage, so they are incorrect.  
Therefore the correct answer is option b.

Question:
How do Sima and Tamal practice English in the Town Hall Language Club?

Options:
a. By reading books only
b. By listening to CDs and watching DVDs
c. By speaking only
d. By writing essays


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the description of the Town Hall Language Club activities — Sima and Tamal use audio-visual materials to improve their English.  
Step 2: From that description we conclude they practice by listening to CDs and watching DVDs, so the correct choice is b.  
Step 3: Other options are incorrect because they state only one mode (reading only, speaking only, or writing essays), while the club specifically uses listening and watching as described.

Question:
What book is Andy reading?

Options:
a. A novel
b. A travel guide
c. A book about Bangladesh
d. A history book


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the clue — the text indicates Andy is reading material specifically about Bangladesh.  
Step 2: Match that to the options: option c ("A book about Bangladesh") directly corresponds to this description, so that is the correct choice.  
Step 3: Why others are incorrect — option a (a novel) implies fiction, option b (a travel guide) implies practical travel info rather than a general book about Bangladesh, and option d (a history book) is narrower and only fits if the text explicitly mentioned history. Therefore the correct answer is c.

How can Sima and Tamal benefit from meeting Andy?

Options:
a. They can learn new vocabulary
b. They can have fun
c. They can practice English with a native speaker
d. All of the above

- a: They can learn new vocabulary — true, because talking with a native speaker introduces natural words and expressions.
- b: They can have fun — true, social interaction can be enjoyable.
- c: They can practice English with a native speaker — true by definition.

Step 3: Since (a), (b) and (c) are all correct, the correct choice is d All of the above.

Question:
Jessica is on holiday with her __________.

Options:
a. sister
b. father
c. friend
d. mother


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Προnounce the sentence needs a noun for the companion: "Jessica is on holiday with her ___."  
Step 2: Check the options: "sister", "father", "friend", "mother". All are grammatically possible, but the correct choice given is (b) "father", so we select "father".  
Step 3: Briefly why others are incorrect: "sister" or "friend" would be chosen only if the context named a sibling or peer; "mother" would be chosen only if the companion were the female parent. Since the intended companion is the male parent, the correct answer is (b) father.

What did Sima and Tamal come to the Town Hall Language Club for?

Options:
a. To eat food
b. To practise speaking English
c. To read books
d. To attend a meeting


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Note the setting — "Town Hall Language Club" implies an activity related to language skills rather than eating or reading.
Step 2: Among the options, "To practise speaking English" directly matches the purpose of a language club.
Therefore the correct answer is (b) To practise speaking English.

Briefly why others are incorrect: (a) eating food and (c) reading books are not primary functions of a language club, and (d) attending a meeting is too general compared to the specific language-practice purpose.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Locate the relevant sentence in the text that describes Andy’s activities in Bangladesh — it explicitly states that he is involved with an NGO.  
Step 2: Interpret that statement directly: if the passage says he works with an NGO, then the correct answer is that he works with an NGO.  
Other options (for example, working for the government, teaching, or running a business) are incorrect because they contradict the explicit information given in the passage.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement: "Sima and Tamal are not interested in practising English."  
Step 2: To verify truth, compare the statement with the factual information (or the intended meaning). Since the correct answer is False, the given statement is not true — the true situation is that Sima and Tamal are interested in practising English.  
Therefore option b (False) is correct and option a (True) is incorrect because it wrongly affirms the negative statement.

Question:
Sima wants to __________ Andy.

Options:
a. introduce
b. avoid
c. visit
d. ignore


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence "Sima wants to __________ Andy" and consider which verb best completes the meaning — Sima intends to do something involving Andy.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: "introduce" means to present Andy to someone (a common, positive action Sima might want to do); "visit" means go to see Andy (possible but less specific); "avoid" and "ignore" are negative and imply distancing.  
Step 3: Choose the best fit: option (a) "introduce" matches the typical intention expressed by "wants to ___ Andy." Thus the correct answer is (a).

Question:
Please call me __________.

Options:
a. Mr. Smith
b. Andy
c. Sima
d. Mrs. Zaman


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Understand the phrase — "Please call me ___" asks for the name or form of address the speaker prefers.  
Step 2: Choose the option that naturally completes the request as a simple personal name: "Please call me Andy" is the most direct and natural fit.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: Andy.  

Why the others are less suitable: a and d use titles plus surnames ("Mr. Smith", "Mrs. Zaman") which are formal and less likely when someone asks to be called informally, and c ("Sima") is a different personal name but the given correct choice is b.

Options:


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Locate the sentence in the passage that describes how Sima and Tamal practise English in the club.  
Step 2: Read the sentence carefully and identify the items they use — the passage explicitly states they use CDs and DVDs.  
Step 3: Conclude that the correct answer is "CDs and DVDs."

Explanation: The passage names "CDs and DVDs" as the tools for practising English, so those are correct. Other options (for example, books, newspapers, or a teacher) are not mentioned in that context and therefore are incorrect.

Question:
What is a useful expression to start a conversation?

Options:
a. See you later.
b. Have a good journey.
c. May I introduce myself?
d. Nice meeting you.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the goal: we need an expression that is useful to start a conversation — something that initiates interaction or asks permission to speak.
2. Evaluate options:
   - a. "See you later." — a farewell, used when leaving, not for starting a conversation.
   - b. "Have a good journey." — a parting wish, not an opener.
   - c. "May I introduce myself?" — directly requests permission to begin and invites dialogue, so it functions as a conversation starter.
   - d. "Nice meeting you." — typically said after or at the end of an introduction, not to start one.
3. Conclusion: option c is the correct choice because it explicitly initiates interaction and opens the conversation.

Question:
Sima and Tamal are in the library.

Options:
a. True

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The statement “Sima and Tamal are in the library” is a conjunction; it is true only if both Sima and Tamal are present.  
Step 2: The correct evaluation is that this conjunction is false (meaning at least one of them is not in the library).  
Conclusion: therefore the correct choice is (b) False. Option (a) True is incorrect because it asserts both are present, which does not hold.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Reasoning: The phrase "leaving in ten minutes" is a common, natural time expression and matches the intended answer; the other options simply give different time intervals ([math]5[/math], [math]15[/math], [math]20[/math]) and do not match the given correct choice. Therefore the correct answer is (b) [math]10[/math].

Question:

Options:
a. They are shopping.
b. They are going on holiday.
c. They are visiting friends.
d. They are working.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the key clue: the correct answer is given as (b) "They are going on holiday," so we look for evidence indicating travel or vacation (words like "packing," "tickets," "hotel," "airport," or "trip").
2. Reasoning: those travel-related clues point to a holiday, not shopping, visiting friends, or working—shopping would mention stores or buying goods, visiting friends would mention meeting people or houses, and working would mention jobs or tasks.
3. Conclusion: therefore the best match among the options is (b) They are going on holiday, because the contextual details clearly indicate travel for a vacation.

Question:
What is the new person reading in the club?

Options:
a. A novel
b. A book about Bangladesh
c. A newspaper
d. A magazine


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. প্রশ্নটি কি খুঁজছে: নতুন ব্যক্তি ক্লাবে কী পড়ছে তা নির্ধারণ করা।  
2. বিকল্প বিশ্লেষণ: একটি সংবাদপত্র বা ম্যাগাজিন সাধারণত পত্রপত্রিকা/জার্নাল; প্রশ্নে “কী পড়ছে” বলে নির্দিষ্ট কোনো বই উল্লেখ করলে এগুলো অনুপযুক্ত। উপন্যাস হলে তা সাধারণত সাহিত্য কাহিনী — যদি স্পষ্টভাবে বলা না থাকে যে সেটা উপন্যাস, তাহলে এটাও নিশ্চিত নয়।  
3. উপসংহার: বর্ণনাটির সাথে সবচেয়ে ভালো মিল করে “a book about Bangladesh” — এটি একটি নির্দিষ্ট বই, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল b।  

বিরোধিত বিকল্পগুলির সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: a (A novel) সম্ভাব্য কিন্তু অনির্দিষ্ট; c (A newspaper) ও d (A magazine) হলো পিরিয়ডিক্যাল, তাই “a book” বলা হলে এগুলো বাইরে পড়ে।

What type of organization does Andy work for?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the context clues about Andy’s work: the passage describes charitable/development activities, community programs, and independent funding rather than government control.  
2. Compare the options: a government agency would be state-run, a private company would aim for profit, and an international body would have intergovernmental status—none match the described independent, charity-focused work.  
3. Therefore Andy works for an NGO (non-governmental organization), which fits the described activities and funding model.

b. Useful expressions
c. Questions only
d. Formal talks


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question—it asks which type of expressions are suggested for conversation beginnings.  
Step 2: Conversation starters should be practical, easy-to-use phrases that help initiate dialogue, which matches "Useful expressions."  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: "Chit chat" (a general informal talk, not specifically recommended starters), "Questions only" (too restrictive), and "Formal talks" (too formal for typical conversation beginnings).  
Therefore the correct answer is b: Useful expressions.

Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:

Step 3: প্রাকৃতিক ও সাধারণভাবে নিজের পছন্দের নাম জানাতে সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত বিকল্পটি হচ্ছে "Andy" — তাই সঠিক উত্তর: (d) Andy.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান: সিমা এবং তামাল ভাষা ক্লাবে যাওয়ার মূল উদ্দেশ্য হলো ইংরেজি বলার অনুশীলন করা, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো (b)। ভাষা ক্লাব সাধারণত কথ্য অনুশীলন, ডায়লগ ও ভাষার কার্যক্রমের মাধ্যমে চর্চার সুযোগ দেয় — এই বিবরণ থেকে বোঝা যায় তারা কথোপকথন অনুশীলনের জন্য গেছে। অন্য অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ (a) নতুন বন্ধু পাওয়া সম্ভাব্য হলেও প্রধান উদ্দেশ্য নয়, (c) বই পড়া মূলত লাইব্রেরির কাজ এবং (d) প্রকল্পে কাজ করা ভাষা ক্লাবের প্রধান লক্ষ্য নয়।

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the proposition: "The train to Sylhet is leaving in five minutes" asserts an imminent departure.
2. Determine truth: since the correct answer is given as b (False), the proposition is not true — the train is not scheduled to depart in five minutes (it may have already left, be delayed, or depart at a different time).
3. Conclusion: therefore option b (False) is correct. Option a (True) is incorrect because the factual claim of immediate departure does not hold.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify that the blank requires a location phrase to complete "Tamal met Andy at the __________."  
Step 2: Substitute each option into the sentence and choose the most natural collocation: "met at the bookshop" is an idiomatic, common phrasing, so option b fits best.  
Step 3: Briefly why others are less appropriate: "language club", "train station", or "school" could grammatically work but are less likely without additional context; the most natural and concise choice is "bookshop" (option b).

Question:
What is one useful expression mentioned at the beginning of a conversation?

Options:


Correct Answer: May I introduce myself?

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the context — an expression used at the beginning of a conversation is typically a polite opening or a way to start speaking.  
Step 2: Compare candidate phrases — "May I introduce myself?" directly asks permission to begin and is explicitly used to start an introduction.  
Step 3: Conclude — therefore the correct and most appropriate opening expression is "May I introduce myself?"  
Brief note: Other phrases (e.g., farewells or responses) are inappropriate because they are used later or for different purposes, not to initiate a conversation.

The conversation takes place in a __________.

Options:
a. Library
b. Cafe
c. Train station
d. Language club


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
The dialogue contains explicit clues about language learning—references to practicing speaking, correcting pronunciation, discussing vocabulary and grammar, and meeting regularly—which indicate an organized language-practice setting. Those details fit a language club rather than a quiet study space or transit area. A library (a) would be quieter and not focused on spoken practice, a cafe (b) might be informal socializing without structured language exercises, and a train station (c) is unrelated to learning activities. Therefore the correct answer is d: Language club.

Step 2: Interpret the meaning: the phrase indicates Sima is recommending that they work on their English together, i.e., practice English with Andy.

Options:
a. They are there to practice speaking English and meeting Andy allows them to achieve that goal.
b. They are attending a seminar about Bangladesh which Andy is leading.
c. They want to learn about NGOs in Bangladesh and Andy provides that information.
d. They are trying to sell books and Andy is a potential buyer.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:

Step 1: Identify their stated purpose — Sima and Tamal are at the Town Hall Language Club to practice speaking English.  
Step 2: Relate this to Andy — meeting Andy gives them the opportunity to speak with a native/experienced English speaker, which directly fulfills their goal.  
Step 3: Conclude the best choice — therefore option (a) is correct.

Question:
What common activity do Sima and Tamal participate in at the Town Hall Language Club, and how does it relate to their introduction to Andy?

Options:
a. They practice English by listening to music, which allows them to meet new people.
b. They read books in English, which is how they learn about Andy's work.
c. They speak English with friends, which helps them feel comfortable introducing new members.
d. They watch movies in English, which distracts them from meeting new people.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the activity described — the Town Hall Language Club context emphasizes conversational practice. The phrase that fits this is speaking English with others, which builds comfort and social connection.

Step 2: Connect to Andy’s introduction — because Sima and Tamal practice speaking English with friends, they become comfortable introducing new people; that directly explains how they meet and introduce Andy.

Why other options are incorrect:
- (a) Listening to music helps listening skills but doesn’t directly enable introductions.
- (b) Reading books may teach vocabulary but doesn’t explain interpersonal introductions to Andy.
- (d) Watching movies can improve comprehension but wouldn’t specifically help them feel comfortable introducing new members.

Thus the correct answer is (c).

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Step 1: পড়ে বুঝুন যে প্রশ্নে জানতে চাওয়া হচ্ছে—Jessica কার সঙ্গে travel করছে।  
Step 2: প্রদত্ত বিকল্পগুলো (a) her brother, (b) her mother, (c) her father, (d) her friend পর্যালোচনা করুন এবং সঠিক উত্তর হিসেবে c ("Her father") নির্ধারণ করুন।  
ব্যাখ্যা: বিকল্প c সরাসরি বলে যে তিনি তার পিতার সঙ্গে যাত্রা করছেন, যাকে প্রশ্নের উত্তর হিসেবে প্রদান করা হয়েছে; অন্য বিকল্পগুলো (ভাই, মা, বন্ধু) প্রশ্নে বা উত্তরটিতে সমর্থিত নয়।  
সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: (c) Her father.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
প্রথমে প্রশ্নে থাকা মূল শব্দটি লক্ষ্য করুন — "Town Hall Language Club" যা ভাষা অনুশীলনের জন্য প্রতিষ্ঠিত স্থানের ইঙ্গিত দেয়। তাই সবচেয়ে যুক্তিযুক্ত উদ্দেশ্য হলো ইংরেজি কথা অনুশীলন করা। অন্য অপশনগুলো তেমন প্রাসঙ্গিক নয়: বই পড়া সাধারণত লাইব্রেরির কাজ, ডিভিডি দেখা ক্লাবের মূল উদ্দেশ্য নয়, আর নতুন বন্ধু করা পরোক্ষভাবে হতে পারে কিন্তু মূল উদ্দেশ্য নয়। তাহলে সঠিক উত্তর হলো (b) — To practice speaking English.

Options:
a. Have a nice day!

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the farewell context we look for the option that refers to Jessica’s upcoming situation or destination.  
Step 2: Option c ("Have fun in Chattogram.") explicitly mentions Chattogram, so it directly fits a parting remark about her trip.  
Therefore the correct answer is c; the other choices are generic farewells ("Have a nice day!", "Take care!", "See you later!") and do not mention Jessica’s destination.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize that a "Language Club" is primarily for practising and improving language skills.  
Step 2: The option that directly matches this purpose is b — "To practise speaking English."  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: a (watch a movie) and c (read books) describe other activities, not the main aim of a language club; d (meet new people) can be a secondary benefit but is not the primary purpose.

Step 3: Explain why others are wrong: option b ("Nice to meet you!") is a phrase used when meeting someone for the first time but is not the exact line; option c ("Hi!") is a different, shorter greeting; option d ("Please call me Andy") is a request, not a greeting.  
Therefore the correct answer is a: "Hello!".

Question:
Why do Sima and Tamal go to the Town Hall Language Club?

Options:
a. To read books
b. To practise speaking English
c. To attend a meeting
d. To watch DVDs


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the purpose — a "Town Hall Language Club" is organized for practicing language skills, especially speaking.  
Step 2: Eliminate incorrect choices: (a) reading books is more a library activity, not specifically a language-club purpose; (c) attending a meeting is generic and doesn't capture the club's language-practice focus; (d) watching DVDs is an entertainment activity, not the primary aim of a speaking club.  
Step 3: Therefore the best choice is (b) to practise speaking English.

Question:
How does Sima introduce herself to Andy?

Options:
a. I'm Andy.
b. Please call me Sima.
c. This is my friend.
d. Hello, I'm Jessica.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read each option and look for a phrase that expresses Sima introducing herself.  
Step 2: Option b "Please call me Sima" is a direct self-introduction asking to be called Sima, so it matches how Sima would introduce herself.  
Why others are wrong: option a says "I'm Andy" (introduces as Andy, not Sima), option c "This is my friend" introduces someone else, and option d "Hello, I'm Jessica" gives a different name. Therefore the correct answer is b.
