Question:
Where is Jessica going on holiday and with whom?

Options:


Correct Answer: She is going to Chattogram with her father.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — use simple reading-comprehension: find the sentence that states Jessica’s holiday plan and identify the destination (usually following the preposition "to") and the companion (usually following the preposition "with").

Working steps:
1. Locate the sentence describing Jessica’s plans. It will contain a destination and a companion.
2. Identify the destination by finding the phrase introduced by "to" — this names the place she will visit (Chattogram).
3. Identify the companion by finding the phrase introduced by "with" — this names who accompanies her (her father).
4. Confirm roles: a proper noun or place name after "to" is the holiday location; a person or relation after "with" is the companion.

Logical reasoning:
- Prepositions convey relationship: "to" → direction/destination; "with" → accompaniment.
- Extracting the nouns/phrases tied to those prepositions gives the required information.

Final answer:
She is going to Chattogram with her father.

Explanation:
Jessica is going to Chattogram with her father because the sentence explicitly names Chattogram as the destination and her father as the person accompanying her. To answer such questions, identify the phrase that shows the location (where) and the phrase that shows the companion (with whom) in the text.

Question:
How does Sima want to improve her English?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Identify the target phrase in the text that states Sima’s intention and the methods she plans to use. The sentence says she wants to improve her English by two activities.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Locate Sima’s goal: “wants to improve her English.” This gives the objective (better spoken/listening/use of English).
2. Find the actions linked to that goal. The text lists two methods: (a) practicing speaking English, and (b) watching DVDs.
3. Interpret why those methods help:
   - Practicing speaking is active production practice (output), which improves fluency, pronunciation, and confidence through repetition and feedback.
   - Watching DVDs provides comprehensible input (listening practice), exposes her to natural speech, vocabulary, and intonation; using subtitles can reinforce word recognition and meaning.

Concise answer:
She wants to improve her English by practicing speaking English and by watching DVDs.

Optional useful example (adds value): Practicing speaking with a partner or language group and watching English-language DVDs with English subtitles combines active practice and input, accelerating improvement.

Explanation:
She plans to practice speaking English and watch DVDs because speaking builds fluency and confidence in using the language, while DVDs provide natural listening input, pronunciation models and useful vocabulary. Combining speaking practice with listening through DVDs reinforces both productive and receptive skills, which helps overall improvement.
