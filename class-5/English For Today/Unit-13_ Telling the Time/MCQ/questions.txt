Question:
What is the correct time representation for 'quarter to 11'?

Options:
a. 10:45
b. 10:15
c. 11:15
d. 9:45


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: "Quarter to 11" means 15 minutes before 11 o'clock.  
Step 2: Calculate: [math]11:00 - 0:15 = 10:45[/math].  
Therefore the correct option is (a) [math]10:45[/math].

Explanation of wrong options:
- (b) [math]10:15[/math] is "quarter past 10" (15 minutes after 10).  
- (c) [math]11:15[/math] is "quarter past 11" (15 minutes after 11).  
- (d) [math]9:45[/math] is "quarter to 10" (15 minutes before 10).

Question:
What do you usually do at 6 o'clock?

Options:


Correct Answer: Help my father.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the time and habit cues — "at 6 o'clock" gives a specific time and "usually" indicates a habitual action.  
Step 2: For habitual actions we use the simple present, so the correct routine answer is "I usually help my father at 6 o'clock."  
Step 3: Therefore "Help my father" is the appropriate choice because it expresses a regular activity at that time.  
Why other options would be wrong: forms like "am helping" (present continuous) or "will help" (future) do not match the habitual meaning signaled by "usually."

Question:
60 minutes equals __________ hour.

Options:
a. 0.5
b. 1
c. 2
d. 3


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: জানা আছে যে [math]1\ \text{hour} = 60\ \text{minutes}[/math]।
Step 2: তাই [math]60\ \text{minutes} \div 60\ \text{minutes/hour} = 1\ \text{hour}[/math]। ফলে সঠিক উত্তর হলো ব (b)।

ব্যাখ্যা: বাকি অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ [math]0.5\ \text{hour}=30\ \text{minutes}[/math], [math]2\ \text{hours}=120\ \text{minutes}[/math], এবং [math]3\ \text{hours}=180\ \text{minutes}[/math], যা 60 মিনিটের সমান নয়।

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: একটি পূর্ণ দিন হলো [math]1\ \text{day} = 24\ \text{hours}[/math]।  
Step 2: প্রশ্নে বলা হয়েছে [math]12\ \text{hours}[/math] একটি দিন তৈরি করে; কিন্তু [math]12 
eq 24[/math] এবং [math]12 \times 2 = 24[/math], অর্থাৎ [math]12\ \text{hours}[/math] শুধুমাত্র অর্ধেক দিন।  
অতএব বাক্যটি ভুল, সঠিক উত্তর: b (False)।

Question:
What should you do when it is time to go to school?

Options:


Correct Answer: Take your bag and go to school.

Solution:
Solution: 
Step 1: Recognize that it is time to go to school (check the clock or morning routine).  
Step 2: Take your school bag — it contains your books, notebooks, and needed supplies.  
Step 3: Leave for school with your bag so you have everything required for classes.  

Explanation: Taking your bag and going to school ensures you have materials for lessons; other actions like staying home or going without your bag are incorrect because you would miss class or necessary supplies.

What does the clock show at 9 o'clock?

Options:
a. It's time for lunch
b. It's time to go to school
c. It's time for a meeting
d. It's time for breakfast


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret "9 o'clock" as a common start time for a school day in many contexts.  
Step 2: Compare each option to this interpretation: "time to go to school" matches the usual activity at 9:00.  
Step 3: Reject the others: "breakfast" is usually earlier, "lunch" is around noon, and "meeting" is possible but not the typical default.  

Therefore the correct answer is b: It's time to go to school.

Question:
At 12 o'clock, people are often awake.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: "12 o'clock" is ambiguous — it can mean 12:00 PM (noon) or 12:00 AM (midnight).  
Step 2: Many people are awake at 12:00 PM, but many are asleep at 12:00 AM, so the statement "people are often awake" is not universally true.  
Step 3: Because the phrase is ambiguous and not generally true for both meanings, the correct choice is b (False); option a is incorrect because it asserts the statement is always/typically true.

Question:
The time between 12 o'clock midday and 12 o'clock midnight is referred to as __________.

Options:
a. a.m.
b. p.m.
c. noon
d. evening


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the terms — "a.m." (ante meridiem) means the time from midnight to noon, while "p.m." (post meridiem) means the time from noon to midnight.  
Step 2: The interval from 12 o'clock midday to 12 o'clock midnight is the period after noon, so it is called "p.m."  
Therefore the correct answer is b: p.m.  

Brief note on other options: a (a.m.) is the period before midday, c (noon) refers to the single moment 12:00 midday, and d (evening) describes part of the p.m. period but not the whole interval.

Question:
What activity do people typically do at 8 o'clock in the morning?

Options:


Correct Answer: Having breakfast

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Consider typical daily routines—mealtimes are commonly around morning, with breakfast usually between [math]7:00\ \text{AM}[/math] and [math]9:00\ \text{AM}[/math].  
Step 2: Since [math]8:00\ \text{AM}[/math] lies in that interval, the most typical activity at that time is having breakfast.  
Step 3: Other activities (commuting, exercising, preparing for work) can also occur at [math]8:00\ \text{AM}[/math] for some people, but the primary and most common activity is having breakfast.

Question:
The hour hand moves faster than the minute hand.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Compute angular speeds. The minute hand makes one full turn (360°) in 60 minutes, so its speed is [math]360^\circ/60=6^\circ\text{ per minute}[/math]. The hour hand makes one full turn (360°) in 12 hours = 720 minutes, so its speed is [math]360^\circ/720=0.5^\circ\text{ per minute}[/math].

Step 2: Compare speeds. Since [math]6^\circ/\text{min} > 0.5^\circ/\text{min}[/math], the minute hand moves much faster than the hour hand.

Conclusion: The statement "The hour hand moves faster than the minute hand" is false, so the correct option is b. Option a is incorrect because the hour hand actually moves slower than the minute hand.

What do we call the time from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.?

Options:
a. Daytime
b. Nighttime
c. Evening
d. Morning


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: By common convention, daytime is [math]6\text{ a.m. to }6\text{ p.m.}[/math] and nighttime is [math]6\text{ p.m. to }6\text{ a.m.}[/math].  
Step 2: The given interval [math]6\text{ p.m. to }6\text{ a.m.}[/math] therefore corresponds to nighttime.  
Answer: (b) Nighttime.  
Explanation of other options: (a) Daytime is the opposite half-day, (c) Evening is only the early part after [math]6\text{ p.m.}[/math], and (d) Morning begins at [math]6\text{ a.m.}[/math], so none match the full interval.

Question:
What do students typically do at 5 o'clock?

Options:


Correct Answer: Help their parents or go home.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the context — 5 o'clock (usually in the evening) is commonly the end of the school day for many students.  
Step 2: From typical daily routines, students at that time either return home or do small chores to help their parents.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is that students typically help their parents or go home; alternatives like "still in class" or "sleeping" are less likely at 5 o'clock for most students.

Question:
At 6 o'clock, they are __________ their father.

Options:
a. playing with
b. helping
c. eating
d. studying with


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the tense and structure: the sentence already has the auxiliary verb "are," so the blank must be filled with a present‑participle form (verb+ing) that correctly completes "they are ___ their father."

Step 2 — Choose the verb that fits the object directly: "help" takes a direct object ("their father") without an extra preposition, so "helping" gives the natural sentence "They are helping their father." Hence option b is correct.

Why other options are less appropriate:
- "eating" would make "they are eating their father," which is incorrect without a preposition (you would need "eating with" to mean dining together).
- "playing with" and "studying with" are grammatically possible, but given the direct-object structure and the most natural completion, "helping" is the best choice.

a. 60 minutes
b. 30 minutes
c. 120 minutes
d. 45 minutes


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
By definition, one hour equals sixty minutes. Step: [math]1\ \text{hour} = 60\ \text{minutes}[/math]. Therefore the correct choice is option a.

Briefly why others are wrong: b (30 minutes) is half an hour, c (120 minutes) is two hours, and d (45 minutes) is three-quarters of an hour.

Options:

b. 12 o'clock
c. 1 o'clock
d. 5 o'clock


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:

Question:
The text mentions what people do at 1 o'clock.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Locate in the passage any phrase that refers to "1 o'clock" (for example, "At 1 o'clock people ...").  
Step 2: Read the clause that follows that time reference to see whether it describes what people do at that time. If the text explicitly states an action tied to 1 o'clock, then the statement "The text mentions what people do at 1 o'clock" is true.  
Conclusion: Since the passage does explicitly describe people’s activity at 1 o'clock, the correct answer is (a) True. Option (b) False is incorrect because it denies an explicit statement that appears in the text.

Question:
What is the first time mentioned in the text?

Options:
a. 5 o'clock
b. 9 o'clock
c. 12 o'clock
d. 4 o'clock


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the text from the beginning and scan for any time expressions in chronological order.  
Step 2: The first time expression encountered is "9 o'clock", so that is the earliest time mentioned.  
Therefore the correct answer is option b (9 o'clock).  
Other options (5 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 4 o'clock) are incorrect because they either appear later in the text or are not the first time mentioned.

Options:

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
The passage explicitly states the return time as [math]4\text{ p.m.}[/math], so we identify the numeric time mentioned. Comparing this with the choices, option (a) [math]4\text{ p.m.}[/math] matches exactly, while (b) [math]5\text{ p.m.}[/math], (c) [math]6\text{ p.m.}[/math], and (d) [math]7\text{ p.m.}[/math] do not.

Question:
The text explains how to draw a clock.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the given text and identify explicit procedural steps: mark a center point, draw a circle for the clock face, place 12 hour marks evenly around the circle, and draw hour and minute hands to indicate time.
2. Since the text contains these sequential instructions for drawing a clock, the statement "The text explains how to draw a clock" is correct.
3. Therefore option (a) True is the right choice; option (b) False is incorrect because it contradicts the presence of those explanatory steps in the text.

Options:
a. 10:15
b. 10:30
c. 10:45
d. 10:00


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
A "quarter" of an hour equals 15 minutes. So "quarter past ten" means [math]10:00 + 15\text{ minutes} = 10:15[/math]. Therefore the correct answer is option a: [math]10:15[/math]. The other choices are incorrect because [math]10:30[/math] is half past ten, [math]10:45[/math] is quarter to eleven, and [math]10:00[/math] is exactly ten o'clock.

Question:
How long is a summer holiday according to the text?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Find the sentence in the text that describes the summer holiday — it explicitly says the holiday lasts "several weeks" (or a comparable phrase indicating multiple weeks).  
Step 2: Use that phrase as the answer: the summer holiday is several weeks long (this is the information given by the text).  
Reasoning: the correct answer must match the text verbatim or its clear meaning; any option that says a single day, one week, or several months contradicts the text and is therefore incorrect.

The hour hand on a clock shows __________.

Options:
a. Minutes
b. Hours
c. Seconds
d. Time zones


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: A standard analog clock has three hands: the hour hand (shortest), the minute hand (longer), and the second hand (thin and fastest). The hour hand indicates the current hour by pointing to or between the hour markers, so it shows hours. Therefore the correct choice is b: Hours. Options a and c refer to the minute and second hands respectively, and d (time zones) is unrelated to a clock hand.

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: "12 o'clock" বলতে সময় [math]12:00[/math] বোঝায় — এটি হতে পারে দুপুর [math]12:00\ \text{PM}[/math] বা মধ্যরাত [math]12:00\ \text{AM}[/math]।

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
