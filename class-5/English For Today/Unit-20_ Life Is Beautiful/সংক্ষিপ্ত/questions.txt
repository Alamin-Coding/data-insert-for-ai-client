Question:
How does Maria know it is a warm day?

Options:


Correct Answer: She feels the glass of the window

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach: Maria uses the sense of touch as a simple thermometer. By feeling the temperature of the window glass she infers the air/ambient temperature outside.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Observation step — Maria places her hand on the window glass and notes the sensation (warm or cool).
2. Physical principle — Heat flows between objects until thermal equilibrium; glass exposed to warm air or sunlight absorbs heat and its temperature rises. Human skin has thermoreceptors that detect heat flow: if the glass feels warm, heat is flowing from the glass to her skin.
3. Logical inference — Because the glass is warm, the surrounding air or sunlight must be warming the glass; therefore the day is warm.
4. Caveat (brief): This method measures the local temperature of the glass surface. If the glass is in direct sunlight it may feel warmer than the air; if there is heating/cooling indoors, that can also affect the glass temperature. Still, feeling the glass gives a quick, reliable indication that it is warm outside in typical situations.

Example (optional but clarifying): If on a sunny summer morning the window glass feels hot to the touch, the heat transfer from the sun-warmed air and radiation to the glass explains why Maria concludes it is a warm day.

Explanation:
Maria knows it's a warm day because the window glass feels warm when she touches it. Warm air and sunlight transfer heat to the glass, and touching it lets her feel that increased temperature directly.

Question:
What script does Maria read to learn information?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Identify what tactile or alternative script a person would use to read information when standard print is not accessible. The most common tactile reading system is Braille.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Determine the implied context: if Maria is described as reading by touch or as someone who cannot access printed text visually, she would use a tactile script.
2. Recall the standard tactile script: Braille is the internationally used system of raised dots that allows blind or visually impaired people to read by finger touch.
3. Conclude that the script Maria reads is Braille, since it is designed specifically for learning and accessing information without sight.

Relevant concept:
- Braille is a system of patterns of raised dots arranged in cells (typically six dots per cell) where different dot combinations represent letters, numbers, punctuation, and even musical or technical notation.

Example (brief): the letter “A” in Braille is represented by a single raised dot in the top-left position of the six-dot cell — a simple illustration of how tactile patterns encode written language.

Answer: Braille

Explanation:
Braille is a tactile writing system made of raised-dot patterns that people who are blind or visually impaired read with their fingertips. Maria reads Braille because those dot patterns encode letters and numbers, allowing her to access written information by touch.

Question:
What does Maria hope to achieve in the future?

Options:


Correct Answer: To go to university and set up a school for visually impaired children

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Identify sentences in the passage where Maria expresses future plans or uses words such as "hope", "want", "plan" or similar.
- Extract the specific goals she mentions and paraphrase them concisely.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Locate Maria’s statements about the future. Look for verbs indicating intention (e.g., "hope to", "want to", "plan to").
2. Identify the objects of those intentions — what she wants to do or become.
3. Combine the identified intentions into a single clear summary of her future aims.

Relevant concepts:
- Explicit intent: when a speaker directly states what they hope or plan to do.
- Paraphrasing: restating those intentions clearly and briefly without changing meaning.

Application:
- From Maria’s statements about the future, she explicitly expresses two linked aims: (a) attend university and (b) establish a school specifically for visually impaired children. These are concrete, sequential goals (education first, then founding the school) and reflect both personal advancement and social purpose.

Final answer:
She hopes to go to university and set up a school for visually impaired children.

Explanation:
This is correct because the passage explicitly says Maria wants to go to university and then set up a school for visually impaired children. It shows her plan to gain higher education so she can create and run a specialized school that supports visually impaired students.

Question:
Why does Maria want to write a book?

Options:


Correct Answer: To show other visually impaired people that they can do amazing things

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — identify Maria’s motive and connect it to broader concepts of representation and empowerment.

Step 1: State the direct answer.
- Maria wants to write a book to show other visually impaired people that they can do amazing things.

Step 2: Explain the reasoning.
- By sharing her experiences and achievements, Maria provides a visible example (a role model) that challenges stereotypes and low expectations about visual impairment.
- Representation matters: when people see someone like them succeeding, it raises their belief in what is possible and encourages them to try new goals.

Step 3: Connect to relevant principles.
- Empowerment and advocacy: personal stories can teach practical strategies and boost confidence.
- Social learning: others learn from modeled behavior; Maria’s book serves as a model for skills, resilience, and opportunities.

Illustrative value (brief):
- For example, a young visually impaired reader who sees Maria’s accomplishments may feel motivated to pursue education, a career, or creative projects they previously thought were out of reach.

Conclusion:
- Therefore, Maria’s primary goal in writing the book is to inspire and demonstrate to other visually impaired people that they are capable of achieving remarkable things.

Explanation:
Maria wants to write a book to show other visually impaired people that they can do amazing things. By sharing her story and achievements, the book becomes a source of inspiration and a concrete example that challenges low expectations and boosts confidence.

Question:
What does Maria enjoy reading?

Options:


Correct Answer: Poems and history

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — look for the explicit statement in the text that describes Maria’s reading preferences and identify the direct objects of the verb “enjoys reading.”

Step 1: Locate the sentence or line that mentions Maria and the phrase “enjoys reading.”  
Step 2: Identify what follows “enjoys reading” — the nouns that name the types of reading material.  
Step 3: Interpret that these nouns are the things she likes to read.

Logical reasoning:
- The verb phrase “enjoys reading” expresses Maria’s preference.  
- The items listed after that phrase are the objects of her enjoyment.  
- If the text explicitly lists “poems and history” after “enjoys reading,” those are the things she enjoys.

Final answer:
Maria enjoys reading poems and history.

Explanation:
The correct answer is "poems and history" because the passage explicitly says Maria enjoys reading those two kinds of books. To answer such questions, look for the exact activities or items named in the text that describe a person's preferences.
