Question:
What method does Maria use to read since she is visually impaired?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — identify reading methods available to someone who is visually impaired and choose the one described by the correct answer.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. A person who is visually impaired cannot rely on standard printed text, so accessible alternatives include tactile systems (Braille), audio/screen-readers, or large-print materials.  
2. The question’s correct answer is Braille, which fits because Braille is a tactile writing and reading system specifically designed for people with little or no sight.  
3. How Braille works: characters are made from patterns of raised dots arranged in a 2×3 cell; each pattern corresponds to a letter, number, punctuation mark, or contraction. Readers move their fingertips over the raised dots to recognize the patterns and read text independently. (For example, the letter “A” is represented by a single raised dot in the top-left position of the cell.)

Conclusion:
Maria reads using Braille, the tactile raised-dot system that enables visually impaired people to read and write independently.

Explanation:
Maria uses Braille because it is a tactile writing system made of patterns of raised dots that can be felt with the fingertips. This lets people who are blind or have low vision read by touch instead of using their eyes.

Question:
What is one of Maria's goals for the future?

Options:


Correct Answer: To set up a school for visually impaired children.

Solution:
Solution:
1. Answer approach — read the passage and look for explicit statements about Maria’s future plans or dreams. Focus on sentences containing keywords like “goal,” “plan,” “future,” “dream,” “want,” or “intend.”

2. Essential steps — locate the sentence where Maria speaks about helping others or setting up something; identify the object of her plan (who will benefit) and the action she intends to take (what she will do).

3. Relevant concepts — reading comprehension and inference: if the passage explicitly states a future intention, choose that as the goal; if it implies a plan, infer carefully from contextual clues.

4. Logical reasoning — compare candidate answers with the passage evidence. The correct choice must match Maria’s stated intention exactly. Other options that are not mentioned or are only implied should be rejected.

5. Conclusion — the passage clearly says Maria aims to establish an educational institution for visually impaired children. Therefore the correct answer is: To set up a school for visually impaired children.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer is "to set up a school for visually impaired children" because Maria explicitly states this as her future plan in the passage. To identify such goals, look for direct statements about what a person intends to do or hopes to achieve.

Question:
What is one activity Maria enjoys, despite her visual impairment?

Options:


Correct Answer: Reading poems.

Solution:
Approach:
Scan the sentence(s) about Maria to find an activity mentioned alongside a contrast phrase such as “despite her visual impairment.” The activity paired with that contrast is the answer.

Working steps:
1. Locate the clause describing Maria and her condition (visual impairment).
2. Identify any verb phrases or activities linked to Maria in the same sentence or nearby sentences.
3. Find the activity that is explicitly said to occur “despite” her visual impairment.

Reasoning:
- The phrase “despite her visual impairment” signals a contrast: an activity Maria continues to do even though she has limited or no sight.
- The text states that Maria enjoys “reading poems” in that same context, so that is the activity performed despite her impairment.
- (It is reasonable that she could read poems via accessible formats such as Braille or audio, but the direct answer is the activity named in the passage.)

Answer:
Maria enjoys reading poems.

Explanation:
She enjoys reading poems because the text explicitly states that Maria, despite her visual impairment, likes to read poetry; this shows that a visual disability does not stop her from enjoying literature, often by listening to recordings or using Braille.

Question:
What did Maria hope to do one day related to her experiences?

Options:


Correct Answer: Write a book about her feelings and experiences.

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Identify the sentence or passage where Maria expresses a future desire.
- Determine whether that desire refers to sharing, recording, or creating something based on her feelings and experiences.
- Paraphrase the expressed hope into a concise answer.

Working steps:
1. Locate textual evidence: Maria says she hopes “one day” to do something related to her feelings and experiences — this phrase signals a future intention.
2. Interpret the action: The text specifies she wants to turn those feelings and experiences into written form intended for others to read.
3. Paraphrase precisely: Convert the explicit statement into a direct answer that captures both the action (write) and the subject matter (her feelings and experiences).

Relevant concepts and reasoning:
- Explicit inference: When a character states a wish (“I hope one day…”), we take that as a direct, explicit future intention rather than an implied idea.
- Focus on content: Because the object of her hope is tied to “feelings and experiences,” the correct action must preserve that content — here, writing about them (a book, memoir, or similar).
- Conciseness: The most natural concise rendering of that intention is “to write a book about her feelings and experiences.”

Answer:
She hoped to write a book about her feelings and experiences.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer is right because Maria explicitly expressed a desire to record her feelings and experiences in written form and hoped to publish them as a book. This shows the underlying idea that she wanted to preserve and share her personal story—using writing as a way to reflect on and communicate what she went through.
