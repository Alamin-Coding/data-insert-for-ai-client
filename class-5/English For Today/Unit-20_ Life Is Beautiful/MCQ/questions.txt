Question:
How does Maria's ability to read Braille contribute to her daily life compared to sighted peers in her school?

Options:
a. She requires more assistance than other students.
b. She learns at a slower pace than sighted students.
c. She can access information independently like any other student.
d. She relies on audio recordings for all her studies.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize that Braille is a tactile reading system that lets a blind student independently read books, labels, and classroom materials.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that fact: option a (needs more assistance) is incorrect because Braille supports independence; option b (learns at a slower pace) is not inherently true—learning pace depends on instruction and practice, not simply on using Braille; option d (relies on audio for all studies) is incorrect because Braille readers can read tactile text and do not depend solely on audio.  
Step 3: Therefore option c is correct: Maria can access information independently like any other student.

Options:
a. To travel around the world.
b. To become a famous writer.
c. To set up a school for visually impaired children.
d. To work as a teacher in a mainstream school.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Maria’s stated long-term goal in the story — she explicitly says she wants to help blind children by creating a place where they can learn.  
Step 2: Match that statement to the options: option c ("To set up a school for visually impaired children") exactly reflects her expressed hope.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a (travel around the world), option b (become a famous writer) and option d (work as a teacher in a mainstream school) are not supported by the text’s description of her specific plan to found a school for visually impaired children.  
Therefore the correct answer is c.

What does Maria use to read and learn at school?

Options:
a. Audio books
b. Braille books
c. Regular books
d. Flashcards


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify which option is specifically designed for reading by someone who cannot use standard printed text — that is Braille, a tactile raised-dot system.
Step 2: Compare options: Braille books provide a tactile way to read and learn in school, whereas audio books are auditory, regular books require sight, and flashcards are for quick drills rather than continuous reading.
Therefore the correct answer is b: Braille books.

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Maria’s stated motive in the prompt — she wants to share her feelings and experiences.  
Step 2: Match that motive to the options: option (a) “To express her feelings and experiences” directly corresponds.  
Step 3: Eliminate others: (b) “To become famous” is not mentioned, (c) “To teach others how to read” and (d) “To help her friends” do not match the stated reason.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a).

c. To become a pilot
d. To learn new languages


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: Read the part of the passage where Maria talks about her future plans and identify the exact goal she mentions. The passage states that Maria wants to "set up a school for visually impaired children," which directly matches option b, so the correct answer is b. The other options (a, c, d) are not supported by the text because Maria did not mention traveling the world, becoming a pilot, or learning new languages as her future goal.

How does Maria’s teacher view her learning abilities?

Options:
a. She is not a good learner.
b. She struggles with learning.
c. She is a good learner.
d. She prefers not to learn.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution: Step 1: Determine what the teacher’s remarks or attitude toward Maria indicate — positive comments, praise for progress, or notes about quick understanding point to a favorable view. Step 2: From that evidence we conclude the teacher regards Maria as capable and effective at learning. Therefore the correct choice is (c) She is a good learner. Other options are incorrect because (a) and (b) assert negative ability while (d) claims she prefers not to learn — none match the teacher’s positive assessment.

Step 2: Match that statement to the choices: option b (“Visually impaired children”) exactly matches the text, so select b.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: (a) sports, (c) wealthy families, and (d) academically struggling children are not mentioned, so they are incorrect.

a. Maria relies on her friends for everything.
b. Maria enjoys reading Braille.
c. Maria has just started school.
d. Maria does not like being with friends.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:

Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify clues in the text — it repeatedly emphasizes Maria’s enjoyment of learning and making her own choices, which points to independence and a love of learning.  
Step 2: Compare options: there is no strong emphasis on her eyesight (a), supportive friends (b), or specifically on academic grades (c).  
Step 3: Conclude that the best match is option d, since the text highlights her independence and love for learning as the key to her happiness.

Question:
Maria's ability to read Braille allows her to:

Options:
a. Visualize the world around her
b. Learn the same as her peers
c. Avoid school
d. Travel easily


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Identify what Braille is — a tactile writing system that lets people who are blind or have low vision read text by touch.  
Step 2: Determine the outcome of being able to read Braille — it provides access to the same written information (books, worksheets, tests) that sighted peers use, so it enables comparable learning opportunities.  
Step 3: Compare options: options a and d refer to vision or mobility (visualizing the world, traveling) which Braille does not directly provide; option c (avoid school) is unrelated and incorrect.  

Therefore the correct answer is: b.

Question:
What motivates Maria to help other visually impaired people?

Options:
a. Her personal experiences and successes
b. Advice from her teachers
c. Pressure from her friends
d. A desire to become wealthy


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the evidence — the passage describes Maria’s own journey overcoming visual impairment and the successes she achieved by learning skills and helping herself.  
Step 2: Reasoning — because she has firsthand experience and has seen positive outcomes, she is motivated to help others in similar situations so they can achieve the same improvements.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices — advice from teachers, pressure from friends, or a desire for wealth are not supported by the passage; the motivation is clearly rooted in her personal experiences and successes.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a) Her personal experiences and successes.

b. She believes it is beautiful despite her limitations.
c. She feels sad about her situation.
d. She thinks it is not worth living.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement about Maria and identify her overall attitude — she emphasizes appreciation and finds beauty in life despite her limitations.  
Step 2: Match that attitude to the choices: choice (b) "She believes it is beautiful despite her limitations" directly describes appreciating life in spite of difficulties, so (b) is correct.  
Step 3: Explain why the others are wrong: (a) focuses only on challenge/difficulty, which ignores her appreciation; (c) implies she is mainly sad, which contradicts her positive outlook; (d) says life is not worth living, which is the opposite of her expressed belief.

In what way does Maria contribute to her own learning environment?

Options:
a. By ignoring her teachers
b. By asking her friends to do everything for her
c. By actively engaging with Braille
d. By avoiding difficult subjects


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the choices and identify which describes an active learning behavior.  
Step 2: Option (c) — actively engaging with Braille — shows Maria taking initiative to access material and practice independently, so it directly contributes to her learning environment.  
Therefore the correct answer is (c).  
Briefly, (a) ignoring teachers, (b) asking friends to do everything, and (d) avoiding difficult subjects are passive or detrimental behaviors that do not help her learn.

What does Maria's hope to go to university suggest about her character?

Options:
a. She is uninterested in education.
b. She is ambitious and determined.
c. She is afraid of challenges.
d. She prefers to stay at home.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the statement — Maria's hope to go to university shows she wants further education and is aiming for future goals.  
Step 2: This attitude indicates ambition and determination, so the correct choice is option b.  
Why others are wrong: option a contradicts her interest in education, option c conflicts with the willingness implied by hoping to attend university, and option d is inconsistent with wanting to pursue studies outside the home.

Question:
What kind of interaction does Maria likely have with her environment?

Options:
a. She relies only on sight to understand it.
b. She uses multiple senses to engage with it.
c. She avoids engaging with her surroundings.
d. She only listens to sounds.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the implication in the question — it asks what kind of interaction Maria "likely" has with her environment, which suggests typical everyday engagement.  
Step 2: Reasoning — ordinary interaction with an environment usually involves seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, or a combination of these; choosing a single sense (only sight or only hearing) is unnecessarily restrictive.  
Step 3: Conclusion — therefore the best answer is (b) she uses multiple senses to engage with it.

Why other options are incorrect:
- a: "She relies only on sight" is too narrow because most people use more than one sense.  
- c: "She avoids engaging" contradicts the idea of interacting.  
- d: "She only listens to sounds" is also too restrictive compared with using multiple senses.

Which of the following professions might align with Maria's aspirations?

Options:
a. An artist who paints
b. A writer who focuses on personal narratives
c. A scientist who studies the stars
d. A pilot who travels frequently


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Maria’s likely aspirations — since the correct answer is given as option b, we infer she seeks self-expression through storytelling or sharing personal experiences.  
Step 2: Match options to that aspiration: option b, a writer who focuses on personal narratives, directly aligns with telling personal stories and reflecting on life.  
Step 3: Eliminate others: an artist who paints (a) may be creative but not necessarily focused on written personal narratives; a scientist who studies the stars (c) and a pilot who travels frequently (d) relate to scientific inquiry and travel respectively, not specifically to personal storytelling.  
Therefore the best match is option b.

Step 2: Match that message to the choices: choice (b) “They can inspire and motivate children” directly expresses this idea, so it is correct.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out others: (a) contradicts the story, (c) is not supported since the story shows clarity rather than confusion, and (d) is too narrow because role models help beyond just school.

c. It shows they cannot succeed academically.
d. It suggests they should give up on their dreams.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:

Step 1: Identify the central portrayal in Maria's story — she pursues goals, learns, and achieves despite visual impairment.  
Step 2: Match that portrayal to the options: option b describes being "capable and ambitious," which directly reflects Maria's actions and attitude.  
Step 3: Conclude that option b is correct because the story emphasizes ability and ambition rather than helplessness.

Explanation of wrong options: option a is incorrect because the story does not show dependence or helplessness; option c is wrong because Maria succeeds academically; option d is false because the story encourages pursuing dreams, not giving up.

c. A sense of isolation from her peers

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Maria’s recurring emotional cues in the passage — she consistently responds to difficulties with optimism, finds small positives, and continues engaging despite setbacks.  
Step 2: Match that pattern to the choices: joy and positivity despite challenges directly describes optimism in the face of problems, so option (b) is correct.  
Step 3: Eliminate others: (a) “frustration” and (d) “anger” imply negative, resentful reactions not supported by the text; (c) “isolation” suggests withdrawal, but Maria remains engaged and upbeat.

Question:
How does Maria's ability to read Braille impact her educational experience compared to other students?

Options:
a. It allows her to learn independently without her friends.
b. It provides her with a different way to access information, similar to how sighted students read.
c. It limits her ability to participate in class discussions.
d. It makes it harder for her to understand her subjects compared to her peers.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
1. Maria’s ability to read Braille gives her a tactile method to access written information—books, notes, and other texts—so she can obtain the same content that sighted students get by reading print.  
2. Therefore this ability functions as an equivalent way of reading, enabling her to learn from the same materials and participate academically on a similar footing; hence option (b) is correct.  
3. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because reading Braille does not mean she must learn without friends, does not inherently prevent class discussion, and does not make understanding subjects harder—it simply provides an alternative access method to the same information.

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:

Step 1: কারণ মারিয়া দৃষ্টিহীন, তাই তিনি চোখে দেখে তাপ অনুভব করতে পারেন না—তাই জ্ঞাতি বা স্পর্শের ওপর নির্ভর করবেন।

Step 3: অন্য অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ: বন্ধুরা বললে জানা যেতে পারে কিন্তু প্রশ্নে স্পর্শের কথা নির্দেশিত; অন্ধকার থাকা তাপের সাথে সম্পর্কিত না; পাখির গানও তাপের নিশ্চিত সূচক নয়।

Step 3: Explain why the others are wrong: (b) teaching her friends, (c) setting up a school, and (d) explaining Braille are more specific goals not supported by the stated motive in the text. Therefore the correct answer is (a).

Question:
In what way does Maria learn information at school?

Options:
a. By listening to audio books.
b. By reading Braille books.
c. By having her friends read to her.
d. By watching videos.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify how Maria, who is likely visually impaired, would access written information at school — the most direct method for a blind student is tactile reading.  
Step 2: Compare the choices: listening to audiobooks (a) and having friends read (c) are indirect and rely on others or audio; watching videos (d) requires vision unless narrated; reading Braille books (b) is a direct, independent method for tactile reading.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) reading Braille books, because it allows Maria to read school material independently; the other options are either indirect or depend on sight.

Question:
Why do Maria's teachers believe she can go to university?

Options:
a. Because she is a good learner.
b. Because she wants to be a writer.
c. Because she has many friends.
d. Because she reads quickly.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the phrase "believe she can go to university" — this refers to Maria's academic ability and readiness for higher education.  
Step 2: Compare the options: option (a) "Because she is a good learner" directly explains why teachers would think she can succeed at university.  
Step 3: Reject the others: (b) wanting to be a writer is a personal goal, not proof of academic readiness; (c) having many friends is social, not academic; (d) reading quickly might help but is less conclusive than being a good learner. Therefore the correct answer is (a).

Question:
Which sensory experience helps Maria to feel the beauty of the spring day?

Options:
a. The sound of the birds.
b. The warmth of the sun.
c. The smell of flowers.
d. The touch of the grass.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the sensory experiences listed: sound, warmth, smell, and touch.  
Step 2: The phrase “feel the beauty of the spring day” most naturally links to the pleasant fragrance that characterizes spring, so the smell of flowers conveys that beauty.  
Step 3: Other options are related but less specific: the sound of birds (a) and the warmth of the sun (b) add atmosphere, and the touch of the grass (d) is tactile; none describe the quintessential spring beauty as directly as the smell of flowers (c).

What does Maria's use of Braille allow her to do?

Options:
a. To write stories.
b. To read effectively.
c. To hear better.
d. To see her friends.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Recognize that Braille is a tactile writing system that lets people who are blind or visually impaired read text by touch.  
Step 2: Therefore Maria's use of Braille allows her to read effectively, which corresponds to option b.  
Options a, c, and d are incorrect because Braille's primary purpose is reading (though it can be used to write, option a is not the main point here), and it does not improve hearing (c) or restore sight to see friends (d).

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:

Step 2 — Interpret that evidence: words showing confidence and agency correspond to feeling "happy and empowered." Therefore the correct choice is c.

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and identify what kind of environmental input helps Maria understand her world — sensory elements vs. social/verbal input.  
Step 2: "Sounds and smells" are direct sensory elements of the environment (auditory and olfactory cues) that provide contextual information about surroundings, so option (b) best matches.  
Step 3: Options (a) Visual cues and (c) Touch and taste are also sensory but the question specifies the element Maria engages with — the given correct choice is sounds and smells; (d) Words from her friends are social/verbal rather than the general environmental cues asked for.

Options:
a. She learns quickly.
b. She is passionate about her studies.
c. She reads Braille proficiently.
d. She participates in class discussions.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the direct evidence — the teacher calls Maria a good learner because of a specific ability mentioned: her proficiency in reading Braille.  
Step 2: Conclude that this matches option c (she reads Braille proficiently), so option c is the correct choice.

Explanation of other options:
- Option a (she learns quickly) and option b (she is passionate about her studies) are positive traits but are not the stated reason.  
- Option d (she participates in class discussions) is also not given as the teacher’s justification. Therefore, option c is the only answer directly supported by the information.

Step 2: Compare options: option a focuses on the challenges of being visually impaired, while b, c, d refer to friendship, education, and nature.  
Step 3: Choose the best match — option a is correct because the book’s stated aim is to bring out Maria’s experiences and struggles as a visually impaired person.

Options:
a. It restricts her ambitions.
b. It shapes her desire to help others.
c. It makes her feel lonely.
d. It has no effect on her goals.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the evidence — the prompt indicates Maria's condition leads her to care about others in similar situations, which is a motivational influence on what she wants to do.  
Step 2: Connect evidence to choices — wanting to help others is explicitly an aspiration shaped by her experience, so choice (b) matches directly.  
Why other options are wrong: (a) is incorrect because the condition does not primarily limit her ambitions, it motivates them; (c) is incorrect because loneliness is not presented as her main response; (d) is incorrect because the condition clearly affects her goals.

d. They are short and simple.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the most likely general reason someone enjoys reading poems — poems are known for expressing feelings and emotions in vivid, artistic language.
Step 2: Compare each option: option (a) "They are easy to memorize" is not generally true for all poems; (c) "They are required in school" describes a circumstance, not a reason for enjoyment; (d) "They are short and simple" is often false since many poems are complex.
Conclusion: Option (b) "They express emotions beautifully" best explains why Maria enjoys reading poems, so the correct answer is (b).

Options:
a. Finding friends.

d. Navigating her school environment.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Step 1: A visual impairment primarily affects a person's ability to see printed or written material.  
Step 2: Therefore a direct and typical challenge is "reading standard texts," which matches option (b).  
Step 3: Briefly why the others are less appropriate: (a) finding friends is a social issue not uniquely caused by vision loss; (c) understanding spoken instructions relates to hearing, not vision; (d) navigating the school environment can be affected by poor vision but is less specifically the core difficulty named here than reading standard texts.

Question:
What is an underlying theme of Maria's story?

Options:
a. The importance of seeing.
b. The power of friendship.
c. Overcoming adversity.
d. The joy of learning.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central conflict — Maria faces significant obstacles (physical, emotional, or situational) that she must confront.  
Step 2: Track the story arc — the narrative emphasizes Maria’s struggles and the ways she adapts, persists, and ultimately moves past those difficulties.  
Step 3: Match to options — this pattern corresponds to option c, "Overcoming adversity," because the core message is about resilience and triumph over hardship.  

Why the others are less appropriate: option a ("The importance of seeing") is too literal and not the story’s main moral; option b ("The power of friendship") would be correct only if friends are the primary force driving change, which the story does not emphasize; option d ("The joy of learning") focuses on discovery rather than survival and growth, so it’s not the best fit.

Step 2: Compare each option with typical reading methods: regular printed books require sight, audio books are listened to, digital tablets are electronic devices, and Braille is the tactile writing system used by people who are blind or visually impaired.
Step 3: Since the correct answer given is Braille, choose option (b). This is consistent because Braille is specifically used for reading by those who cannot read standard print; the other options are incorrect for that purpose in this context.

Options:

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Identify the claim: the sentence asserts that "Maria can see the spring day." Step 2 — Reasoning: a "spring day" denotes a span of time or the season's weather, not a single visual object; while Maria can see elements of a spring day (flowers, sunlight, trees), she cannot literally "see" the entire day as a single visible entity. Conclusion — therefore the statement is false, so option (b) is correct; option (a) is incorrect because it treats the abstract period "spring day" as something directly visible.

Options:
a. novels

c. magazines

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
We need a word that names something Maria reads and that forms a natural parallel with "history." Option poems (b) is the best fit: it is a literary form, so "reading poems and history" is a clear, grammatical pairing (similar categories of reading material). 

Why others are less suitable: "novels" (a) and "fiction" (d) are both types of narrative prose (so less distinct from each other), and "magazines" (c) refers to periodicals rather than a literary form; among the choices, "poems" most clearly matches the intended parallel with "history."

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Step 1: Understand the goal — to physically experience the warm weather, Maria needs a direct sensory contact that conveys temperature.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: a (look out the window) only gives visual information, d (ask friends) gives second‑hand reports, and c (go outside) would work but is a bigger action than the minimal way to feel warmth.  
Step 3: The simplest direct way while staying inside is b — she puts her hand on the glass and can feel the warmth, so (b) is correct.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Note the phrase "since childhood" — it implies a skill taught or acquired very early in life.  
Step 2: Among the options, "Reading Braille" is a skill typically learned from a young age by someone who is blind, so it directly matches the clue.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is (b) Reading Braille.

Solution: Read the sentence in the passage where Maria describes why she is setting up the school and identify the main verb expressing purpose (e.g., "to teach"). From that statement we see her explicit goal is to educate children who are visually impaired, so the correct choice is "to teach visually impaired children." Other choices (such as running a business, teaching sighted children, or only providing shelter) are incorrect because they are not supported by the stated purpose in the text.

Question:
What does Braille consist of?

Options:
a. Raised dots
b. Curved letters
c. Digital text
d. Printed numbers


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize that Braille is a tactile reading and writing system designed for people who are blind or visually impaired.  
Step 2: Braille characters are made from patterns of small, raised dots arranged in cells (typically up to six dots) so they can be felt with the fingertips. Therefore the correct choice is (a) Raised dots.  
Explanation why others are incorrect: (b) Curved letters and (d) Printed numbers refer to visual print, not tactile patterns; (c) Digital text is electronic and not inherently tactile unless converted into raised dots or a refreshable Braille display.

Question:
Maria cannot feel the warm day.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the statement — "Maria cannot feel the warm day" asserts Maria is unable to perceive the warmth of the day.  
Step 2: Determine the truth — the given correct answer is that this assertion is false, so Maria can feel the warm day (the claim of inability is incorrect).  
Step 3: Conclude and justify — choose b: False because the sentence denies Maria's ability to feel warmth; since that denial is not true, the statement is false. Option a (True) is incorrect because it would claim Maria cannot feel the warm day, which contradicts the correct judgment.

Question:
The __________ of the birds fills Maria's room.

Options:
a. singing
b. yelling
c. talking
d. whispering


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the expected form: the phrase "the ___ of the birds" requires a noun or gerund that describes something produced by birds.
2. Meaning and collocation: "singing" (a gerund) naturally describes the sound birds make and commonly collocates with "birds"; "yelling" and "talking" imply human-like loud speech, and "whispering" implies very soft human speech.
3. Conclusion: "singing" best fits both grammatically and semantically, so the correct answer is (a) singing.

Question:
What does Maria smell when she opens the window?

Options:


Correct Answer: Flowers outside her home.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the scenario — opening a window allows outdoor air and scents to enter the room.  
Step 2: Match that with the choices: a scent coming in through an open window is most plausibly from outdoor sources such as nearby plants.  
Conclusion: Therefore Maria smells the flowers outside her home.  
Brief note on other options: indoor smells (cooking, perfume, smoke from inside) would not specifically be explained by opening the window, so they are less likely.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Interpret the sentence — Maria's goal is to demonstrate the abilities of visually impaired people. The best completion is "everything" because showing they can do everything emphasizes their capability and challenges limiting assumptions. Options a ("nothing") and d ("less") are negative and contradict her intent; option c ("some things") is partially positive but still restrictive. Therefore the correct answer is b.

How does Maria feel about her life?

Options:

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence context — the teacher is giving a general positive description of Maria, so we need an adjective that commonly pairs with "learner."  
Step 2: Compare options: "poor" is negative, "slow" implies a specific learning pace, "quick" means fast but is more specific than a general appraisal; "good" is the common positive description teachers use.  
Therefore the best choice is b (good).

Why others are incorrect: a (Hearing) would be chosen only if the text mentioned difficulty hearing; c (Speaking) would require mention of inability to speak; d (Walking) would require mobility problems — none of these are indicated.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Read the sentence "Maria wants to write a book about her ___" and note we need a noun denoting the subject of the book. Step 2 — Evaluate options: "feelings" is a natural, idiomatic topic for a personal book ("a book about her feelings"); while "friends", "school", and "family" are possible topics, they are less likely given the possessive "her" and the common collocation "write a book about her feelings." Therefore the correct answer is b: feelings.

Question:
What script does Maria read?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the clue: Maria reads using a tactile dot-based system (implied by the question context), which indicates a non-visual script.
2. Eliminate visual scripts (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic) because they require sight to read.
3. Conclude that the only common tactile reading system is Braille, so Maria reads Braille.

Explanation: Braille is specifically designed for readers who are blind or visually impaired and uses raised dot patterns felt with the fingertips; other script options are visual and therefore incorrect.

Step 2: Consider possible methods — listening to the teacher or audio, tactile materials, or reading raised-dot Braille.

Step 2: Match that goal to the choices: the phrase “show them what they can do” corresponds directly to the idea that they “can do amazing things.”  
Step 3: Eliminate other options because they do not express encouragement or demonstration of ability (for example, options about asking for help or giving up contradict her intention to inspire).

Step 2: Match these clues to the options: History directly deals with past events and fits those interests, so it is the best choice.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out others: Art would fit if her interest were creating or studying visual works; Chemistry if she liked experiments and science; Philosophy if she were drawn to abstract reasoning — none of which match the given clues.  
Therefore the most probable subject Maria will study at university is History (option a).

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Step 2: Check options: all four are things one can read, but the intended and best-fit choice is খ (b) "history," giving the natural sentence "Maria enjoys reading poems and history."  
Why others are less preferred: "novels" and "science fiction" are specific fiction genres (they would change the emphasis to fiction), and "magazines" denotes periodicals; although grammatically possible, the correct answer provided is (b) "history," which pairs idiomatically with "poems."

সমাধান: প্রথমে প্রশ্নটি পড়ে উপলব্ধি করা হয় কোন কৌশলে মারিয়া পড়তে শিখেছে — অপশনগুলোকে একে একে যাচাই করা হয়েছে। অপশন b বলে স্পষ্টই বলা আছে "সে ব্রেইলে পড়তে শিখেছে", যা সরাসরি প্রশ্নের সঠিক উত্তর; অন্য অপশনগুলো (সাধারণ বই, ভিডিও, সরাসরি শিক্ষক থেকে শুনে) সেই বিবৃতির সঙ্গে মিলছে না। তাই সঠিক উত্তর: b — সে ব্রেইলে পড়তে শিখেছে।

Question:
মারিয়া ভবিষ্যতে কী করতে চায়?

Options:
a. একটি স্কুল স্থাপন করতে।
b. একটি হাসপাতাল খোলার জন্য।
c. একজন গায়ক হতে।
d. একটি দোকান খোলার জন্য।


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রশ্নে সরাসরি বলা হয়েছে যে মারিয়া ভবিষ্যতে একটি স্কুল স্থাপন করতে চায়, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো ক।  
ধাপে ধাপে ব্যাখ্যা: প্রথমে প্রশ্ন থেকে মূল বক্তব্য শোনা/পড়া হয়েছে — মারিয়ার ভবিষ্যৎ পরিকল্পনা কি তা জানতে হবে; তারপর দেওয়া অপশনগুলোর মধ্যে মিলিয়ে দেখা হয়েছে। অন্যান্য অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ খ হাসপাতাল খোলার কথা, গ গায়ক হওয়ার কথা এবং ঘ দোকান খোলার কথা—এসবই মারিয়ার পরিকল্পনার সাথে মেলে না।

Question:
In what way does the natural beauty of Saint Martin's Island contrast with Maria's experience of the world around her?

Options:
a. Maria can appreciate nature through senses other than sight.
b. Maria lives in a more urban environment than the island.
c. Saint Martin's Island is less accessible than Maria's school.
d. Both environments offer limited interaction with the community.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the contrast — Saint Martin’s Island is described for its striking visual natural beauty (scenery, beaches, colors).  
Step 2: Identify Maria’s experience — she perceives and appreciates the world through senses other than sight (touch, sound, smell), rather than primarily through visual impressions.  
Step 3: Conclude that the contrast is that the island’s beauty is mainly visual whereas Maria’s experience is non-visual, so option a is correct.

Why the others are incorrect:
- b is incorrect because the contrast is about mode of perception, not whether Maria lives in an urban area.  
- c is incorrect because accessibility of the island versus Maria’s school is not the point of comparison.  
- d is incorrect because it asserts both environments offer limited community interaction, which is not supported by the contrast described.

Question:
Considering Maria's aspirations and the attractions of Saint Martin's Island, what theme is prevalent in both contexts?

Options:
a. The importance of education and exploration.
b. The value of nature and beauty in life.
c. The challenges faced by individuals in achieving their goals.
d. The necessity of community support for personal growth.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central idea in Maria’s aspirations — she faces obstacles and struggles while trying to achieve her goals, so a theme of challenges in pursuit of goals is present.  
Step 2: Identify the central idea associated with Saint Martin’s Island attractions — besides beauty, the context often implies barriers such as access, preservation issues, or the effort required to enjoy and protect the place, which again points to challenges related to achieving or sustaining an ideal.  
Step 3: Conclude which option matches both contexts — option c is the best fit because both passages emphasize difficulties people face when trying to reach their aims.  

Why other options are incorrect: option a (education and exploration) fits Maria partly but not the island; option b (nature and beauty) fits the island but not necessarily Maria’s aspirations; option d (community support) may appear in one context but is not a shared, dominant theme.
