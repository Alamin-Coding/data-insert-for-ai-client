Question:
In what way do Sima's preferences for leisure activities contrast with the dietary recommendations from the Food Pyramid?

Options:
a. Sima enjoys physical activities, while the Food Pyramid emphasizes sedentary choices.
b. Sima focuses on social interaction, whereas the Food Pyramid highlights nutrition for health.
c. Sima prefers unhealthy foods, while the Food Pyramid promotes balanced diets.
d. Sima's leisure activities include cooking, which is not part of the Food Pyramid.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Sima’s leisure preference — she values social interaction in her leisure activities (spending time with others, social hobbies).
Step 2: Identify the Food Pyramid’s emphasis — it is a dietary guideline focused on balanced nutrition and health, not on social or leisure aspects.
Step 3: Compare and conclude — the contrast is that Sima’s interest is social interaction while the Food Pyramid highlights nutritional guidance for health, so option b is correct.

Why other options are wrong:
- Option a is incorrect because the Food Pyramid does not emphasize sedentary choices; it promotes healthy eating and often encourages physical activity alongside diet.
- Option c is incorrect because there’s no statement that Sima prefers unhealthy foods.
- Option d is incorrect because cooking is a leisure activity for Sima but the Food Pyramid is a nutrition guide, not a list of leisure activities.

Question:
How does the structure of the Food Pyramid reflect on the dietary habits discussed in Sima's and Biju's leisure activities?

Options:
a. Both emphasize the importance of grains, which are a common theme in leisure discussions.
b. The Food Pyramid suggests more protein, which is reflected in their physical activities.
c. Sima and Biju's interests in food are unrelated to the Food Pyramid's recommendations.
d. Their leisure activities do not consider healthy eating as per the Food Pyramid.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the Food Pyramid’s structure — its base emphasizes grains and cereals as the largest recommended portion of the diet.  
Step 2: Compare this with Sima’s and Biju’s leisure-related food mentions — both discussions repeatedly reference grain-based foods as common and central to their habits.  
Step 3: Conclude that this alignment shows the pyramid’s emphasis on grains is reflected in their leisure activities, so option a is correct.

Why other options are incorrect:
- b is wrong because the pyramid’s greater emphasis on grains (not increased protein) matches their habits.  
- c is wrong because their interests do relate to the pyramid’s grain recommendation.  
- d is wrong because their leisure activities do reflect consideration of a staple (grains) consistent with healthy-eating guidance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
In the context of healthy eating, how does the Food Pyramid's structure compare to the leisure activities mentioned by Sima and Biju in terms of prioritization?

Options:
a. The Food Pyramid emphasizes equal importance of all food groups, similar to how Sima and Biju both value leisure activities equally.
b. Just as the Food Pyramid prioritizes grains for energy, Sima prioritizes talking to her cousin, indicating her need for connection.
c. Biju's swimming is like fats in the Food Pyramid, which are consumed in moderation.
d. The Food Pyramid suggests that all activities, like swimming and talking, are equally beneficial, which is not the case in Sima and Biju's preferences.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The Food Pyramid gives priority to foods at the base (grains/carbohydrates) as primary energy sources, with other groups placed above indicating lesser relative emphasis.  
Step 2: In the leisure examples, Sima prioritizes talking to her cousin (a primary preference for her), while Biju’s preferred activity (swimming) is a different, not necessarily lesser choice.  
Step 3: Option b draws the correct parallel: just as the Pyramid prioritizes grains for energy, Sima’s choice of talking to her cousin shows a prioritized need for connection.  

Why the others are wrong: option a is false because the Pyramid does not treat all food groups equally; option c is incorrect because fats are limited in the Pyramid but Biju’s swimming is an active, not “moderation” activity; option d is wrong because the Pyramid does not suggest all activities (or food groups) are equally important.

Question:
Which food group is found at the bottom of the Food Pyramid, indicating that it should be consumed the most?

Options:
a. Fruits and vegetables
b. Grains
c. Protein and dairy
d. Fat and oil


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: The food pyramid is arranged so the bottom tier represents the food group to be eaten in the largest amount. Grains (breads, cereals, rice, pasta) occupy that bottom tier, so the correct answer is b. Fruits and vegetables are a large part but usually sit above grains; protein and dairy, and fat and oil, are smaller portions nearer the top, so options a, c, d are incorrect.

Question:
What is a key nutritional benefit of grains, as indicated in the Food Pyramid?

Options:
a. They are high in protein.
b. They help improve vision.
c. They provide energy.
d. They strengthen bones.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the Food Pyramid: grains (bread, rice, pasta) form the base and are primarily a source of carbohydrates.  
Step 2: Carbohydrates are the body's main source of energy, so the key nutritional benefit of grains is providing energy — hence option c is correct.  
Briefly why others are incorrect: a is incorrect because grains contain some protein but are not the major protein source; b is incorrect because vision is mainly supported by vitamin A from certain fruits and vegetables; d is incorrect because bone strength comes mainly from calcium-rich foods like dairy.

According to the Food Pyramid, which food items should be consumed in limited amounts?

Options:
a. Fruits and vegetables
b. Grains
c. Meat and dairy
d. Fat and oil


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the standard Food Pyramid layers — the largest/base groups are grains and fruits & vegetables, middle groups include meat and dairy, and the smallest/top group is fats and oils.  
Step 2: Foods in the smallest/top group are meant to be eaten in limited amounts, so the correct choice is d: fat and oil.  
Why others are incorrect: a (fruits and vegetables) and b (grains) form the larger, more frequent parts of the diet, and c (meat and dairy) are middle-tier foods to be consumed in moderate amounts.

Options:
a. They are found at the top level of the pyramid.
b. They help our teeth and bones.
c. They provide high energy.
d. They should be eaten in large quantities.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: খাদ্য পিরামিডে খাদ্যগুলো স্তরে বিভক্ত থাকে — নিচের স্তরে বেশি পরিমানে খাওয়ার খাদ্য (আনাজ), মাঝামাঝি স্তরে প্রোটিন ও দুগ্ধজাত পণ্য এবং উপরের স্তরে চর্বি ও মিষ্টি থাকে।  
Step 2: দুগ্ধজাত পণ্যগুলোর প্রধান উপকারিতা হলো ক্যালসিয়াম ও ভিটামিন যা হাড় ও দাতকে শক্ত করতে সাহায্য করে, তাই "তারা আমাদের দাঁত ও হাড়কে সাহায্য করে" বিবৃতি সঠিক।  
Step 3: অন্য অপশনগুলির তर्क: "শীর্ষ স্তরে" বলা ভুল কারণ দুগ্ধ সাধারণত শীর্ষে নয়; "উচ্চ শক্তি দেয়" মুলত চর্বি ও চিনিযুক্ত খাবার বেশি শক্তি দেয়; "বড় পরিমাণে খেতে হবে"ও ভুল—দুগ্ধ সুন্দর পরিমাপে খেতে বলা হয়।

Question:
How do beans and lentils contribute to a healthy diet according to the Food Pyramid?

Options:
a. They are primarily sources of fat.
b. They offer essential carbohydrates.
c. They provide protein.
d. They are rich in sugars.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize that beans and lentils belong to the legume/plant-protein group in the Food Pyramid.  
Step 2: Nutritionally they are rich in protein (complete or complementary amino-acid sources), fiber, and some complex carbohydrates, so their primary contribution is protein.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is c) They provide protein. Options a) and d) are incorrect because legumes are not primarily sources of fat or sugars, and b) is incomplete—while they contain carbohydrates, their defining role in the pyramid is as a protein source.

Step 1: Recall the lesson: when you have choices about food you should select healthy, balanced options.  
Step 2: Compare the options: option (b) "Make good choices" matches the lesson advice.  
Step 3: Explain why the others are wrong: (a) choosing only favorite foods can be unbalanced, (c) eating from only one food group is unhealthy, and (d) avoiding fats completely is unnecessary because some fats are needed in moderation.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Which food items are categorized as protein sources in the Food Pyramid?

Options:
a. Fruits and vegetables
b. Rice and bread
c. Meat, fish, and beans
d. Fat and oil


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify which foods are primarily protein sources — proteins come from both animal (meat, fish, eggs) and plant (beans, lentils, peas, nuts) sources.  
Step 2: Among the options, "Meat, fish, and beans" are rich in protein and fit the protein group of the food pyramid, so option (c) is correct.  
Step 3: The other options are incorrect because fruits and vegetables mainly provide vitamins and fiber, rice and bread are carbohydrate/grain sources, and fats and oils provide lipids/energy rather than significant protein.

In terms of health, what role do fruits and vegetables play according to the Food Pyramid?

Options:
a. They provide energy.
b. They help maintain healthy bones.
c. They are sources of vitamins.
d. They are mainly protein-rich.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the food-group role — fruits and vegetables in the Food Pyramid are grouped as plant foods that supply micronutrients and fiber.  
Step 2: Key nutrients — they are rich in vitamins (for example vitamin A, C, folate), minerals and dietary fiber, which supports the immune system and overall health.  
Step 3: Evaluate the options — (a) “provide energy” is mainly the role of carbohydrates from grains; (b) “help maintain healthy bones” is primarily associated with dairy (calcium and vitamin D); (d) “mainly protein-rich” is false because fruits and vegetables contain relatively little protein.  
Therefore the correct answer is c: They are sources of vitamins.

b. In moderation.
c. Replaced completely by grains.
d. Only during special occasions.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: উত্তরটি নির্ধারণ করতে খাদ্য পিরামিডের ধারণা বুঝুন — শীর্ষে থাকা খাদ্যগুচ্ছগুলো সাধারণত সীমিত পরিমাণে খাওয়ার নির্দেশ দেয়।  
Step 2: চর্বি ও তেল গুরুত্বপূর্ণ কারণ তারা শক্তি দেয় ও ভিটামিন (A, D, E, K) শোষণে সাহায্য করে, তাই তাদের পুরোপুরি বাদ দেওয়া উচিত নয়, বরং ছোট এবং নিয়ন্ত্রিত পরিমাণে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করা উচিত।  
Step 3: অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হলো ব — "In moderation"। অন্যান্য অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ (a) চর্বি প্রতিটি খাবারের প্রধান অংশ হওয়া উচিৎ নয়, (c) শস্য দিয়ে চর্বি পুরোপুরি প্রতিস্থাপন করা সম্ভব নয় এবং (d) শুধু বিশেষ অনুষ্ঠানে খাওয়া উচিত—এগুলো স্বাস্থ্যসম্মত পুষ্টির নীতি মেনে চলে না।

Options:
a. It shows the most expensive foods.
b. It helps to understand food groups and their required intake.
c. It lists only junk food options.
d. It promotes eating only sweets.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: খাবারের পিরামিড কোন তথ্য দেয় তা চিহ্নিত করা—এটি বিভিন্ন খাদ্যগোষ্ঠী (যেমন শস্য, সবজি, ফল, প্রোটিন, দুগ্ধ, এবং চর্বি/মিষ্টি) ও প্রতিদিন কত পরিমাণ খাওয়া উচিত তার স্তরভিত্তিক নির্দেশনা দেয়।  
ধাপ ২: এই নির্দেশনা ব্যবহার করে আমরা ভারসাম্যপূর্ণ খাদ্যাভ্যাস সাজাতে পারি যাতে প্রয়োজনীয় পুষ্টি ও ক্যালোরি পাওয়া যায় এবং অতিরিক্ত মিষ্টি/চর্বি এড়ানো যায়।  
ধাপ ৩: তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো (b) — এটি খাবারের গোষ্ঠী ও তাদের প্রয়োজনীয় গ্রহণ সম্পর্কে বোঝায়। অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলি (a) খরচ সম্পর্কিত তথ্য দেয় না, (c) শুধুমাত্র জাঙ্ক ফুড দেখায় না, এবং (d) কেবল মিষ্টি খাওয়ার প্রচার করে না—এইগুলো পিরামিডের উদ্দেশ্যের বিপরীত।

Question:
Which food group is at the bottom of the Food Pyramid?

Options:
a. Fats and oils
b. Fruits and vegetables
c. Grains
d. Proteins


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall that the base (bottom) of the Food Pyramid represents the food group that should make up the largest proportion of daily intake — the staple energy-giving foods.  
Step 2: In most standard food pyramids, grains (bread, rice, pasta, cereals) form that base because they provide abundant carbohydrates and calories. Fruits and vegetables, proteins, and fats/oils occupy higher, smaller tiers because they are needed in lesser proportions.  
Therefore the correct answer is c: Grains.

Question:
Dairy products are found at the top of the Food Pyramid.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the classic Food Pyramid structure — the base contains grains, above that fruits and vegetables, then proteins and dairy, and the very top is reserved for fats, oils, and sweets which should be consumed sparingly.  
Step 2: Dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese) is placed in a middle tier with protein-rich foods, not at the top.  
Conclusion: The statement is false, so the correct answer is b.  
Why a is incorrect: Saying dairy is at the top confuses it with fats/oils/sweets, which are the actual top layer of the pyramid.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. খাবারের পিরামিডে নিচের স্তরে সাধারণত শস্যজাত, রুটি, চাল ইত্যাদি কার্বোহাইড্রেট-সমৃদ্ধ খাদ্য থাকে যা প্রধান শক্তি সরবরাহ করে।  
2. কার্বোহাইড্রেট আমাদের দেহকে দ্রুত ও প্রধানত শক্তি দেয়, তাই শক্তিদায়ক খাবারগুলো পিরামিডের নীচের স্তরে অবস্থান করে।  
3. উপর্যুক্ত কারণে সঠিক উত্তর হল গ (Bottom level)। টপ স্তরটিতে মিষ্টি ও তেল জাতীয় খাবার থাকে (সীমিত পরিমাণে) এবং মধ্যের স্তরে ফল, সবজি ও প্রোটিনীয় খাবার রয়েছে — সেগুলো প্রধানত শক্তির মূল উৎস নয়।

c. Fruits
d. Vegetables


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what "protein source" means — foods that are relatively high in protein content and commonly used to meet protein needs.  
Step 2: Compare the options: rice is mainly a carbohydrate source, fruits mainly provide vitamins and sugars, and vegetables provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber but generally less protein.  
Step 3: Beans (legumes) are rich in protein and commonly used as a primary protein source, especially in plant-based diets.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) Beans.

Question:
Fruits and vegetables provide us with important __________.

Options:
a. Energy
b. Vitamins
c. Proteins
d. Fats


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify typical nutrient sources — carbohydrates, fats and proteins are the main energy-yielding nutrients (found largely in grains, oils, meat, legumes), while vitamins and minerals are micronutrients found in smaller amounts.  
Step 2: Fruits and vegetables are especially rich in vitamins (for example vitamin C, A, K and folate), along with fiber and antioxidants.  
Therefore the best choice is b: Vitamins. Options a (Energy), c (Proteins) and d (Fats) are less appropriate because fruits and vegetables are not primary sources of energy, proteins, or fats.

Question:
What is a primary benefit of grains?

Options:
a. They have large amounts of fat.
b. They contain proteins.
c. They give us energy.
d. They provide no nutritional value.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main nutrient in grains — most grains (rice, wheat, corn, oats) are rich in carbohydrates.  
Step 2: Recall that carbohydrates are the body's primary energy source; for example, [math]1\ \text{g \;carbohydrate} = 4\ \text{kcal}[/math], so a serving of grains supplies substantial calories for energy.  
Step 3: Conclude that the primary benefit of grains is providing energy, so option (c) is correct.

Briefly why the others are incorrect:
- Option (a): Grains do not generally have large amounts of fat.  
- Option (b): Grains contain some protein but it is not their primary benefit.  
- Option (d): False — grains do provide nutritional value (mainly energy, plus fiber, vitamins, minerals).

Question:
The Food Pyramid suggests we should eat more from the top levels.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. The Food Pyramid arranges food groups so the base (bottom) are foods to eat most (e.g., grains, vegetables, fruits) and the top are foods to eat sparingly (fats, oils, sweets).
2. The statement "we should eat more from the top levels" contradicts this design, so it is false.
3. Therefore the correct answer is b (False). Option a is incorrect because top-level items are meant to be limited, not eaten in larger amounts.

d. Pyramids


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand what a food pyramid is — it is a visual guide that organizes foods according to their nutritional categories and recommended proportions.  
Step 2: Match that definition to the options: "Groups" correctly reflects that foods are categorized (for example grains, vegetables, fruits, proteins, fats).  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) Groups.  

Explanation of other options: "Choices" (a) implies individual selection rather than categories; "Types" (c) is similar but less precise than "groups" in nutritional guidance; "Pyramids" (d) is just the shape and not the content.

Question:
What category of food is at the top of the Food Pyramid?

Options:


Correct Answer: Fats and oils

Solution:
Solution: The food pyramid is arranged by recommended intake, with the largest sections (base) for foods to eat most often and the smallest section (top) for foods to eat sparingly. Step 1: Recall the pyramid layers — grains and cereals at the base, then fruits and vegetables, then proteins and dairy, and finally a very small top section. Step 2: The topmost, smallest section represents fats, oils (and often sweets), indicating they should be consumed least. Therefore the correct answer is fats and oils; other categories are larger because they are recommended in greater amounts.

Which group of foods are located at the bottom of the Food Pyramid?

Options:
a. Fats and oils
b. Fruits and vegetables
c. Grains
d. Meat and dairy


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the standard Food Pyramid structure — the widest, bottom level represents the food group that should be eaten in the largest amounts.  
Step 2: That bottom level is the Grains group (bread, rice, pasta, cereals), which are the primary source of carbohydrates and provide most of the daily energy, so they form the foundation.  
Step 3: Other options are incorrect because fats and oils are at the top (used sparingly), fruits and vegetables occupy a large but higher tier, and meat and dairy are middle tiers for protein and calcium.  
Therefore the correct answer is c: Grains.

Question:
Fruits and vegetables are important for our health.

Options:
a. True

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: 
Step 1: Fruits and vegetables supply essential nutrients—vitamins (like vitamin C and A), minerals (like potassium), dietary fiber, and antioxidants—that the body needs for growth, immune function, and tissue repair. 
Step 2: Regular intake of fruits and vegetables is linked to lower risk of chronic diseases (heart disease, some cancers), better digestion, and maintaining a healthy weight. 
Therefore the statement is true, so the correct answer is (a). Option (b) is incorrect because it contradicts the well-established nutritional and health benefits of fruits and vegetables.

Question:
What does protein help our bodies with?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the main functions of proteins in the body — they supply amino acids that are used to build and maintain body structures such as muscles, skin and organs.  
Step 2: When tissues are damaged or need growth, the body uses amino acids from proteins to repair and synthesize new cells, so proteins directly support building and repairing tissues.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is “building and repairing tissues.”  
Note: Other options like “providing vitamins” or “serving as the main energy source” are incorrect because vitamins are separate nutrients and carbohydrates/fats are the body’s primary energy sources (proteins can be used for energy only if needed).

Question:
What role do grains play in our diet?

Options:


Correct Answer: They provide energy.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main nutrient in grains — grains (like rice, wheat, maize) are rich in carbohydrates, mainly starch, which is the body's preferred fuel.  
Step 2: Explain how that gives energy — carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, and cellular respiration converts glucose into usable energy; for example, aerobic respiration: [math]C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{energy}[/math].  
Therefore the primary role of grains in our diet is to provide energy.

Correct Answer: To ensure we get all necessary nutrients.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Different foods provide different nutrients — for example, fruits and vegetables give vitamins and fiber, grains provide carbohydrates, dairy and meats give proteins and calcium.  
Step 2: Because no single food contains every nutrient the body needs, eating a variety ensures you obtain the full range of vitamins, minerals, macronutrients and fiber.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is “To ensure we get all necessary nutrients.” Other possible choices like “because it tastes good” or “to feel full” may be true in part but do not address the nutritional balance and prevention of deficiencies.

ধাপ ১: ফল ও সবজিতে ভিটামিন A, ভিটামিন C ও ক্যারোটিনয়েড (যেমন লুটেইন, জিএজান্থিন) থাকে, যা রেটিনা ও চোখের কোষকে রক্ষা করে এবং দৃষ্টিশক্তি রক্ষায় সহায়ক।  
ধাপ ২: এই পুষ্টি উপাদানগুলো চোখের ফাংশন উন্নত করে ও চোখের ক্ষয় কমায়, ফলে দৃষ্টি উন্নত হওয়ার প্রধান কারণ ঘটে।  
ধাপ ৩: তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো গ — "এগুলো আমাদের দৃষ্টি উন্নত করতে সাহায্য করে"।  

অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলোর ব্যাখ্যা: ক কিছুটা ফাইবার থাকার কারণে তৃপ্তি দিতে পারে কিন্তু চোখের উপকারিতা এর থেকে ভিন্ন; খ ফলে শর্করা থাকলেও শর্করা দৃষ্টি উন্নত করে না; ঘ ফল ও বেশিরভাগ সবজিতে চর্বি সাধারণত কম থাকে, তাই এটি সঠিক নয়।
