Question:
My home district is Kishoreganj. It is about 145 kilometres from Dhaka. It is a district headquarters. The district has 8 municipalities, 13 upazilas, 108 unions and 1745 villages. The name Kishoreganj comes from the name of an old landlord known as Brojakishore Pramanik or Nandakishore Pramanik. The area of Kishoreganj municipality is about 10 square kilometres. The river Narasunda flows through the town.

Kishoreganj is a small town, but there are many important places in and around it. The largest Eid fairgrounds, called Solakia Eid Ground and the well-known Government Gurudayal College are in the town. People from many districts come to this place to celebrate Eid. The Pagla Mosque is also in my home district. Outside the town, you can visit the fort of Isah Khan at Jangal Bari. You can also see the Shah Muhammad Mosque at Egaroshindhur. Near the Fuleshwari River, you can see the Shiva Temple of Chandrabati.
