Question:
What might the hare's decision to take a nap during the race suggest about his character?

Options:


Correct Answer: It suggests he is overconfident and lacks respect for his opponent's abilities.

Solution:


Explanation:
The hare’s decision to nap shows he was overly confident, assuming he would win easily and so relaxed his effort. This behavior also shows a lack of respect for his opponent’s abilities, which can lead to complacency and unexpected defeat.

Question:
How did the hare's perception of time lead to his downfall in the race against the tortoise?

Options:


Correct Answer: He thought he could afford to take a nap.

Solution:


Explanation:
He underestimated how long the race would take and assumed he had extra time, so he stopped to take a nap; while he slept, the tortoise kept moving and passed him. The underlying idea is that overconfidence and misjudging time or effort lets steady, consistent action beat careless delays.

In what way does the tortoise's approach to the race contrast with the hare's?

Options:


Correct Answer: The tortoise was steady and persistent, while the hare was overconfident and reckless.

Solution:


Explanation:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
How did the hare's perception of the race influence his actions during the competition?

Options:


Correct Answer: He thought he could take a nap because he was far ahead.

Solution:
Solution:
Approach:
Identify the hare’s belief about his lead, then trace how that belief changed his behaviour and produced the outcome. Use simple logical steps and relevant behavioural principles (overconfidence, complacency, underestimation).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Perception: The hare believed he was far ahead of the tortoise in the race. This is a judgment about relative position and margin.
2. Cognitive effect: That belief created overconfidence and a sense of security — he judged the remaining risk as low.
3. Action taken: Because he felt assured of winning, he decided to rest and take a nap during the race instead of maintaining his pace.
4. Consequence: While the hare rested, the tortoise kept moving steadily. The hare’s pause allowed the tortoise to close the gap and ultimately pass him.
5. Outcome: The hare’s initial perception directly caused the decision to stop racing temporarily, which led to his defeat despite his speed advantage.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Overconfidence/complacency: Assuming current advantage guarantees success can lead to risky inaction.
- Underestimation of opponents: Ignoring an opponent’s persistence (tortoise’s steady pace) can produce unexpected outcomes.
- Time management and continuous effort: Maintaining effort is often necessary until the goal is actually secured.

Conclusion:
The hare’s perception that he was far ahead produced overconfidence, so he took a nap; that action (pausing) allowed the tortoise to win.

Explanation:
He believed his lead was unassailable, so he relaxed and took a nap instead of keeping up his effort. That overconfidence let the tortoise catch up and win, showing that misjudging a lead leads to careless actions and defeat.

Question:
What lesson can be inferred from the tortoise's victory over the hare?

Options:


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Explanation:
Approach — identify the contrasting behaviors of the hare and the tortoise in the fable, extract the underlying moral principles, and show how those principles lead to the stated lesson.

Step 1 — Identify actions and outcomes:
- The hare is fast but becomes overconfident and takes breaks; its inconsistent effort leads to losing the race.
- The tortoise is slow but keeps moving steadily without giving up; its consistent effort leads to victory.

Step 2 — Extract relevant concepts:
- Consistency: regular, sustained effort over time.
- Perseverance: continuing despite difficulties or slow progress.
- Overconfidence and complacency: intermittent effort or stopping can negate natural advantages.

Step 3 — Logical reasoning:
- A fast start or natural advantage (hare) is not sufficient if effort is interrupted; progress must be maintained.
- Small, steady gains (tortoise) accumulate and eventually surpass irregular or halted progress.
- Therefore, persistent, consistent action increases the probability of reaching a goal even when pace is slow.

Step 4 — Brief illustrative example (adds value):
- In studying, a student who studies a little each day steadily masters material, while one who crams occasionally may fail to retain enough to succeed.

Conclusion:
From the tortoise’s victory we infer that consistency and perseverance can lead to success.

Explanation:
The tortoise’s win shows that steady, regular effort can beat quick but careless bursts of work — the hare’s overconfidence and breaks let the slow but persistent tortoise reach the goal. It teaches that consistency and perseverance build progress over time and are often more reliable than sporadic speed or arrogance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
In what way does the tortoise's approach to the race differ from the hare's?

Options:


Correct Answer: The tortoise remained steady and focused while the hare was overconfident.

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
Compare the behaviors and attitudes of the two animals, identify the key differences in strategy and mindset, and explain how those differences determine the race outcome.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Identify tortoise’s approach:
   - The tortoise moves at a slow but steady pace and remains focused on the goal without getting distracted.
   - Key principle: consistent, persistent effort over time (steady progress).

2. Identify hare’s approach:
   - The hare relies on speed but becomes overconfident, takes a break, or wastes time believing victory is assured.
   - Key principle: overconfidence and complacency can negate short-term advantages.

3. Compare consequences:
   - Steadiness + focus means the tortoise continually reduces the remaining distance to the goal.
   - The hare’s bursts of speed are undermined by pauses and a lack of sustained attention, allowing the tortoise to catch up and pass.
   - Logical conclusion: consistent effort beats intermittent effort when complacency causes lost time.

Relevant concepts:
- Persistence and consistency often outperform intermittent advantages.
- Overconfidence can lead to mistakes (resting too early, losing focus), which erodes initial advantages.
- Time and sustained action are critical in tasks measured by completion rather than short bursts of performance.

Example (brief and illustrative):
In the fable of “The Tortoise and the Hare,” the hare’s decision to nap from overconfidence gave the tortoise time to continue progressing and win—demonstrating steady focus vs. overconfidence.

Final statement:
The tortoise remained steady and focused, while the hare was overconfident and complacent, which explains their different outcomes.

Explanation:
The tortoise kept a slow but steady pace and stayed focused on finishing the race, while the hare grew overconfident, relaxed and lost focus. This shows that consistent effort and concentration can beat speed combined with complacency.

Question:
What impact does the hare's nap have on the outcome of the race?

Options:


Correct Answer: The nap caused him to lose the race to the tortoise.

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
Compare what each racer does over time. The winner is the one who reaches the finish line first, so a pause in progress by one runner gives the other time to close the gap.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. The hare stopped running and took a nap, so his forward motion temporarily ceased.
2. The tortoise kept moving steadily without stopping. Because the tortoise continued to make progress while the hare did not, the tortoise reduced the hare’s lead.
3. If the nap lasted long enough for the tortoise to reach the finish line before the hare resumed and overtook him, the tortoise would win.
4. In the fable, the hare’s nap was exactly long enough that the tortoise passed the sleeping hare and reached the finish first.

Relevant concept:
- Relative motion and time: A pause by a faster runner gives a slower but steady runner time to cover the remaining distance; consistency can overcome intermittent advantage.

Conclusion:
The hare’s nap allowed the tortoise to continue moving and reach the finish line first, so the nap caused the hare to lose the race to the tortoise.

Explanation:
The hare’s nap stopped him long enough for the slow but steady tortoise to catch up and pass, so the hare lost the lead and the race. It illustrates that consistent effort and persistence can overcome brief bursts of speed or overconfidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
How does the tortoise's attitude during the race contrast with that of the hare?

Options:


Correct Answer: The tortoise was determined, while the hare was complacent.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — Identify and compare the behaviors and attitudes shown by each animal in the story, then explain how those attitudes affect the race outcome.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Observe the tortoise’s behavior: he moves slowly but consistently, keeps to the course, and does not give up despite being slower. This shows determination and persistence.
2. Observe the hare’s behavior: he is confident of an easy win, becomes overconfident, stops to rest and gets distracted. This shows complacency and underestimation of the opponent.
3. Apply the principle: steady, focused effort (perseverance) tends to outperform intermittent effort combined with overconfidence and distraction. The tortoise’s consistent progress ultimately allows him to win when the hare’s complacency causes delay.
4. Conclude from cause and effect: the tortoise’s determination produced continuous progress; the hare’s complacency produced a loss of advantage.

Relevant concept: perseverance versus complacency — perseverance is sustained, goal-directed effort; complacency is unwarranted self-satisfaction that reduces vigilance and effort.

Brief illustrative example: A student who studies a little each day (steady work) will often outperform a student who crams occasionally and assumes they don’t need to prepare (complacency).

Final statement: The tortoise was determined and persistent, while the hare was complacent and overconfident.

Explanation:
The tortoise stayed determined and kept a slow but steady pace, focused on finishing the race. The hare was complacent and overconfident, stopped to rest and lost focus, so the tortoise’s persistence overcame the hare’s carelessness.
