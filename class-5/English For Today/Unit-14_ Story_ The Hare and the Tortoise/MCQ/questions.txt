Question:
In the story of the Hare and the Tortoise, what lesson does it teach?

Options:
a. Speed is the most important.
b. Slow and steady wins the race.
c. Always take a nap.
d. Running is better than walking.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: In the fable the Hare is fast but becomes overconfident and rests, while the Tortoise moves slowly but steadily and ultimately wins. The step-by-step reasoning is (1) observe the Hare's behavior: speed without persistence leads to failure; (2) observe the Tortoise's behavior: consistent effort leads to success. Therefore the correct lesson is "Slow and steady wins the race" (option b). The other options are incorrect because (a) speed alone is shown to be insufficient, (c) "always take a nap" is a plot detail not a moral, and (d) "running is better than walking" misses the point about perseverance.

c. By walking steadily.
d. By getting help.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: গল্পে খরগোশ দ্রুত দৌড়ায় কিন্তু আত্মতুষ্ট হয়ে পথের মাঝে বিশ্রাম/ঘুমায়, তাই তার গড় অগ্রগতি হঠাৎ কমে যায়।  
ধাপ ২: কচ্ছপ ধীরে হলেও নিয়মিত ও স্থির গতিতে চলতে থাকে এবং বিরতি নেয় না, ফলে সময়ের সঙ্গে তার মোট অগ্রগতি বাড়তে থাকে।  
ধাপ ৩: শেষ পর্যন্ত স্থিরভাবে অবিচলভাবে এগোনোর ফলে কচ্ছপ ফinis্-lাইন পৌঁছে যায় এবং খরগোশকে হারায়। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে (c) — স্থিরভাবে হাঁটা।  

কেন অন্যান্য অপশন ভুল: (a) কচ্ছপ দ্রুত দৌড়ায়নি, (b) কচ্ছপ ঘুমায়নি বরং খরগোশ ঘুমিয়েছিল, (d) গল্পে কচ্ছপকে কারও সাহায্য করা হয়নি।

Question:
What does the story of the Hare and the Tortoise emphasize?

Options:
a. Speed is everything.
b. Persistence and determination.
c. Winning is not important.
d. Taking naps is beneficial.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the plot — the Hare is faster but becomes overconfident and rests, while the slow Tortoise keeps moving and eventually wins.
Step 2: Identify the moral — the story highlights steady effort and determination overcoming apparent disadvantages.
Step 3: Match this to the options: option b ("Persistence and determination") exactly captures that moral.
Why others are incorrect: option a ("Speed is everything") contradicts the outcome, option c ("Winning is not important") is false because the race outcome matters to the lesson, and option d ("Taking naps is beneficial") misinterprets the hare’s nap as positive rather than a cautionary detail.

Question:
What lesson can be inferred from the comparison between the hare's speed and the tortoise's steady pace in the race?

Options:
a. Quickness always guarantees victory.
b. Taking breaks can improve performance.
c. Steadiness and perseverance can lead to success.
d. Winning is more important than participating.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the events — the hare was faster but took breaks, the tortoise moved slowly and steadily and ultimately won.  
Step 2: Reasoning — the story shows that consistent, persistent effort can overcome intermittent speed; steadiness and perseverance lead to success.  
Step 3: Conclusion — therefore option (c) is correct: steadiness and perseverance can lead to success.  
Why others are wrong: (a) is false because quickness alone did not guarantee victory; (b) is misleading because taking breaks hurt the hare’s result rather than improving it; (d) is unrelated to the lesson, which emphasizes how to act rather than valuing victory over participation.

What lesson can be inferred from the outcome of the race between the hare and the tortoise?

Options:
a. Speed is more important than strategy.
b. Consistent effort can lead to success.
c. Winning requires natural talent only.
d. Races should always be taken seriously.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the story, the hare’s speed plus overconfidence led it to rest, while the tortoise’s steady, unbroken effort led to victory.  
Step 2: The lesson is therefore that consistent, persistent effort can overcome a faster but inconsistent opponent—this directly matches option b.  
Step 3: Options a and c are incorrect because the outcome shows speed or natural talent alone did not secure the win; option d is not the primary moral since the emphasis is on persistence rather than merely taking races seriously.

Question:
How does the tortoise's approach to the race contrast with that of the hare?

Options:
a. The tortoise is faster but less determined.
b. The tortoise takes few breaks while the hare naps.
c. The tortoise is more confident than the hare.
d. The tortoise runs quickly while the hare moves slowly.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the story's contrast: the tortoise wins by steady, persistent progress while the hare is fast but becomes overconfident and naps.  
2. Match this to the options: option (b) states that the tortoise takes few breaks while the hare naps, which exactly captures the steady pace vs. hare's resting error.  
3. Eliminate the others: (a) is wrong because the tortoise is not faster, it is slower but more consistent; (c) is wrong because the tortoise is steady rather than more confident; (d) is wrong because it reverses the true traits (the hare is fast, not slow).  

Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
What does the hare's decision to nap during the race signify in terms of character?

Options:
a. He is overconfident and careless.
b. He values rest over competition.
c. He respects the tortoise's abilities.
d. He is tired from running too fast.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Identify the behaviour: the hare chooses to stop and nap during the race despite being ahead, which shows a confident assumption of inevitable victory. Step 2 — Reasoning: this calm, premature rest is best interpreted as overconfidence and carelessness, because he underestimates the need to continue racing and fails to guard against being overtaken. Step 3 — Why other choices are wrong: (b) implies a principled preference for rest rather than a mistaken judgment, which the story doesn't support; (c) would require evidence of admiration or respect for the tortoise, absent here; (d) suggests physical exhaustion, but the hare naps by choice after feeling secure, not from being too tired. Therefore the correct answer is a: He is overconfident and careless.

In what way does the tortoise demonstrate determination during the race?

Options:
a. By challenging the hare to a contest.
b. By walking steadily without stopping.
c. By trying to run faster than the hare.
d. By sleeping to regain strength.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the story detail — the tortoise shows determination by maintaining a slow but steady pace and never stopping.  
Step 2: Compare options: a (challenging the hare) describes initiating a contest, not the tortoise’s determined behavior during the race; b (walking steadily without stopping) matches the tortoise’s persistent, unhurried progress; c (trying to run faster) is false because the tortoise does not speed up; d (sleeping to regain strength) contradicts determination in the race.  
Conclusion: The correct answer is b because steady, continuous effort demonstrates determination.

What does the phrase 'Slow but steady wins the race' imply about competition?

Options:
a. Only fast animals can win.
b. Persistence can yield better results than speed.
c. Taking naps is beneficial for athletes.
d. Winning is not important in a race.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb "Slow but steady wins the race" — it means consistent, persistent effort over time often leads to success even if one is not the fastest.  
Step 2: Compare the options: (a) claims only speed matters, (c) is irrelevant about naps, (d) denies the importance of winning.  
Step 3: Therefore the best match is option b: "Persistence can yield better results than speed," which directly captures the proverb's meaning.  
Step 4: Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either contradict the proverb's emphasis on steady effort or are unrelated to its message.

Question:
How does the tortoise's victory affect the hare's perception of himself?

Options:
a. He learns that he is not the fastest.
b. He becomes more competitive in future races.
c. He is furious at his own overconfidence.
d. He decides to train harder for next time.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the immediate psychological outcome — the tortoise’s unexpected victory exposes that the hare’s defeat was due to his own arrogance and carelessness.  
Step 2: Reasoning — the hare realizes he lost not because he wasn’t fast, but because his overconfidence and lack of seriousness cost him the race; his dominant reaction is anger directed at himself for that mistake.  
Step 3: Conclusion — this matches option (c): he is furious at his own overconfidence.  

Why the others are incorrect: (a) is wrong because the hare still knows he is fast; (b) and (d) describe possible later responses (becoming more competitive or training), but the primary, immediate reaction in the story is self-directed fury over his arrogance.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the statement—this refers to the well-known fable where the tortoise challenges the hare to a race.  
Step 2: Recall the story: the tortoise proposes (challenges) the hare, so the statement is factually true.  
Therefore the correct answer is option a (True); option b is incorrect because it contradicts the established story.

Question:
The tortoise said, '__________ but steady wins the race.'

Options:
a. Slow
b. Fast
c. Quick
d. Clever


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the common proverb "Slow but steady wins the race." The missing word is "Slow," so option a is the correct fit.
Step 2: Reasoning — the proverb contrasts steady, persistent progress with mere speed; "Slow" captures that meaning. Options b "Fast" and c "Quick" stress speed (which contradicts the proverb), and d "Clever" is unrelated, so they are incorrect.

Question:
What did the hare do during the race?

Options:


Correct Answer: He took a nap.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the explicit action described in the story — the hare stopped running and rested.  
Step 2: Interpret that resting as taking a nap (sleeping during the race), which directly answers the question.  
Step 3: Why other options are incorrect: choices like “kept running,” “cheated,” or “got lost” contradict the story detail that he paused to sleep, so they are not supported by the text.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement "The hare won the race at the end."  
Step 2: Recall the well-known outcome of the fable "The Tortoise and the Hare": despite the hare's speed, the tortoise wins the race because the hare becomes overconfident and stops, so the tortoise finishes first.  
Step 3: Therefore the statement is incorrect. The correct choice is (b) False; option (a) True is wrong because it contradicts the story's outcome.

Question:
The tortoise walked ________ during the race.

Options:
a. Quickly
b. Steadily
c. Hastily
d. Carelessly


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify what the sentence describes: the manner in which the tortoise walked during the race — tortoises are characteristically slow and maintain a constant pace.
2. Choose the word that matches that idea: "steadily" means moving at a regular, continuous pace, so it fits the tortoise's manner.
3. Therefore the correct answer is b. "Quickly" implies high speed, "hastily" implies rushed carelessness, and "carelessly" implies lack of attention — none match the tortoise's steady, deliberate movement.

Question:
What lesson can be learned from the story?

Options:


Correct Answer: Slow but steady wins the race.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the characters' behaviors — one competitor rushes and becomes overconfident while the other proceeds slowly but consistently.  
Step 2: Observe the outcome — despite being slower, the steady competitor reaches the finish because the hurried one makes mistakes and rests.  
Step 3: Generalize the lesson — consistent, persistent effort leads to success more reliably than reckless speed.  
Why other options are incorrect: choices that promote mere speed, luck, or talent ignore the role of perseverance and steady work, so they do not match the story's outcome.

Options:

b. Take a nap
c. Eat some food
d. Finish the race


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
The hare’s behavior in the story shows he was overconfident and stopped to rest; he believed he had enough time to sleep before the race ended. Therefore the correct choice is option b: Take a nap. Options a, c, and d are incorrect because the hare did not choose to run faster, eat, or immediately finish the race—he chose to nap, which caused him to lose.

Options:

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: To answer a True/False question, check whether the passage explicitly states the fact in the statement — here, whether it says the hare was angry at the moment he woke up.  
Step 2: The statement directly asserts that the hare “was angry when he woke up”; if the passage contains that description, the statement is true.  
Conclusion: therefore the correct choice is a (True). Option b (False) would only be correct if the passage contradicted or did not state that he was angry on waking.

Step 1: Identify the central theme of the story — repeated effort over time leading to steady improvement and final success.
Step 2: Match that theme to the options: (a) emphasizes winning above all, (b) emphasizes practice but not necessarily ongoing steady effort, (c) emphasizes speed only, and (d) emphasizes sustained effort leading to success.
Therefore the best choice is d: Consistency leads to success, because it directly captures the story’s message about steady, continued effort. Options (a), (b), and (c) are narrower or misplaced interpretations of the moral.

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The phrase "and soon was not in sight" implies the hare disappeared in a short time, so we need an adverb denoting high speed. Therefore choose (b) "Quickly." Other options are incorrect because "Slowly" contradicts "soon," "Carefully" describes manner rather than speed, and "Steadily" suggests a constant pace but not necessarily rapid disappearance.

Question:
What animal is the fastest in the story?

Options:


Correct Answer: The hare.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify descriptions or events in the story that indicate speed (e.g., races, someone being overtaken, phrases like “ran fastest”).
Step 2: Compare those indicators for each animal — the hare is described as outrunning or beating the others in races, while the others (for example the tortoise, fox, or sheep) are shown as slower or unable to catch up.
Step 3: Conclude from the comparisons that the hare is the fastest animal in the story.
Explanation: Other options are incorrect because the story’s events explicitly show them being overtaken or losing races to the hare, so the hare must be the fastest.

Question:
What did the animals come to watch?

Options:
a. A fight
b. A dance
c. A race
d. A picnic


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Step 1: Look for contextual clues that indicate an event with a clear start and finish (e.g., animals lined up, someone saying “ready, set, go”, or a winner crossing a line).  
Step 2: Use process of elimination: a fight would show aggression and conflict, a dance would involve music and coordinated movement, a picnic would involve sitting and eating — none of those fit clues about starting positions, running, or a winner.  
Step 3: The descriptions best match an event where participants compete to reach a finish line, i.e., a race. Therefore the correct answer is: c: A race.

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and identify the sense required — the two animals kept watching one another for the entire duration of the race.  
Step 2: Choose a preposition that expresses continuous action over the whole period: "throughout" means during the whole time, so it fits perfectly.  
Step 3: Check other options: "during" (option b) can mean at some time within the race but does not emphasize the entire duration; "before" and "after" (options c and d) refer to times outside the race, so they are incorrect.  
Final answer: a (Throughout).

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution: Recall the classic fable where the tortoise wins by maintaining a slow but consistent pace rather than hurrying or stopping. Comparing the options, "steady" best describes that steady, continuous effort, so option (c) matches. Options (a) "He rushed" contradicts the tortoise’s slow pace; (b) "He was lazy" implies inactivity rather than persistent effort; (d) "He was fearful" is irrelevant to the reason he won. Therefore the correct answer is (c) He was steady.

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the situation — the hare lost the race, which typically causes negative emotions such as anger, frustration, or sadness rather than positive ones.  
Step 2: Match emotions to options — among the choices, "Furious" best matches the strong negative reaction to losing.  
Step 3: Select the best option — therefore the correct answer is b (Furious).

What did the tortoise do while the hare was sleeping?

Options:


Correct Answer: He kept walking steadily.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The story states that the hare fell asleep during the race.  
Step 2: Meanwhile the tortoise continued moving at a steady pace without stopping.  
Step 3: Because he kept walking steadily, the tortoise overtook the sleeping hare and reached the finish first, so the correct answer is “He kept walking steadily.”  

Why other choices are wrong: any option saying the tortoise stopped, slept, or suddenly ran fast contradicts the fable’s point that consistent, steady progress (not speed bursts or stopping) led to his win.

What does the phrase 'slow but steady' imply?

Options:
a. Only fast animals win
b. Consistency helps achieve goals
c. Patience is not important
d. Only the strong succeed


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the phrase — "slow but steady" contrasts speed ("slow") with regularity ("steady"), so it emphasizes consistent, reliable progress over time.  
Step 2: Reasoning — steady effort, even if slow, accumulates and leads to achieving goals; this directly matches option b.  
Step 3: Answer — option b is correct: Consistency helps achieve goals.  
Step 4: Why the others are incorrect — option a ("Only fast animals win") focuses on speed alone, option c ("Patience is not important") contradicts the idea of steady progress, and option d ("Only the strong succeed") emphasizes strength rather than consistent effort.

Step 2 — Reasoning: in the classic fable the hare’s overconfidence caused him to stop and nap, allowing the slow but steady tortoise to pass and win; thus overconfidence was the reason for the hare’s loss, not victory.

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the key facts — the tortoise moved slowly but continuously, while the hare was faster but stopped (became overconfident and rested).  
Step 2: Reasoning — in a race the winner is the one who reaches the finish line first; continuous forward progress, even if slow, accumulates over time and can overcome intermittent pauses by a faster competitor.  
Step 3: Conclusion — therefore the tortoise won by being steady and not giving up.  
Brief note on other choices: being faster or lucky would not fit the story, since the hare was faster but lost due to stopping, and luck is not the central cause given in the narrative.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
The key step is to recall the fable: the hare was overconfident and stopped to rest during the race, which allowed the tortoise to pass and win. Therefore the hare’s mistake was taking a nap, which directly matches option b. Options a, c, and d are incorrect because the hare was actually fast (not running too slowly), it did not start late, and its loss was due to resting, not lack of training.

Step 2: From the story/context there is at least one animal (for example the hare or others) that did not support the tortoise, so the universal claim is not satisfied.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the phrase "without stopping" — it implies moving in a continuous, consistent manner rather than changing pace or pausing.  
Step 2: Match meanings: "Steadily" means maintaining a constant, uninterrupted pace, so it fits best.  
Step 3: Other options are less suitable: "Quickly" only indicates speed, "Hastily" implies rushed or careless action, and "Slowly" indicates low speed but not necessarily continuous movement.

Solution:

Step 1: Recall the story’s key event — the race was suggested to settle the boastful contest between the swift hare and the slow tortoise.  
Step 2: In the fable the tortoise, wishing to prove a point about perseverance despite being slower, proposed the race to challenge the hare’s arrogance.  
Therefore the correct answer is b (the tortoise). Other options are incorrect because the hare did not propose the race (it accepted or mocked the idea), and the forest or the friends are not characters who proposed the race.

The tortoise was the fastest animal in the forest.

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: "Fastest" means having a greater running speed than all other animals in the forest.  
Step 2: A tortoise is a slow-moving reptile; typical forest animals (e.g., deer, rabbits, foxes, hares) have much higher running speeds.  
Step 3: Since the tortoise is not faster than those animals, the statement is false. Therefore the correct answer is b. Option a is incorrect because it contradicts the known speeds of tortoises versus other forest animals.

Explanation of choices: option (b) "Hard work and persistence lead to success" directly matches the story's outcome; option (a) is false because speed alone did not win; option (c) is contradicted by the slower victor; option (d) is incorrect because a slow animal did win through perseverance.

Correct Answer: The tortoise passes by and keeps walking steadily.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the fable "The Hare and the Tortoise" — the hare, overconfident in its speed, takes a nap during the race.  
Step 2: While the hare is asleep, the tortoise continues moving steadily and passes the sleeping hare, ultimately taking the lead.  
Explanation why others are wrong: any option saying the hare wakes and immediately wins or that the tortoise stops is incorrect because the story’s point is the tortoise’s steady progress while the hare rests, which lets the tortoise overtake.

Question:
What animal fell asleep during the race?

Options:
a. The tortoise
b. The hare
c. A fox
d. A lion


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: In the classic fable "The Tortoise and the Hare," the hare becomes overconfident and stops to rest, falling asleep during the race. The tortoise keeps going steadily and wins, so the sleeping racer is the hare. Options a, c, and d are incorrect because the tortoise did not sleep, and neither a fox nor a lion are the animal who slept in that story. Therefore the correct answer is b.

b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Question:
The hare thought he would win because he was the __________.

Options:
a. slowest
b. fastest
c. biggest
d. smartest


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The hare believed he would win because he relied on his speed, so the best choice is "fastest" (option b). In a race context, being the fastest directly implies the greatest chance of winning. The other options are wrong: "slowest" is the opposite, "biggest" doesn't guarantee victory in a race, and "smartest" might help strategy but is not the stated reason in this context.

Question:
What does the phrase 'Slow but steady wins the race' mean?

Options:


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Interpret the phrase: "Slow but steady wins the race" contrasts speed with steadiness; it highlights that a moderate, consistent approach outlasts a fast but inconsistent one.  
Step 2 — Reasoning: Consistency and persistence build progress over time (regular small gains compound), whereas bursts of speed with lapses often fail to sustain advantage.  
Step 3 — Conclusion: The best match is "Consistency and persistence can lead to success over speed."  
Brief note on other interpretations: any option claiming that slowness alone is always best or that only speed matters is incorrect, because the proverb emphasizes steady effort rather than mere slowness or mere speed.

c. Next to a big tree
d. At the finish line


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the statement in the source that specifies the starting point — it explicitly says the race began next to a big tree.  
Step 2: Match that phrase to the choices; this corresponds to option c.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: d (at the finish line) is contradictory, and a (at the river) and b (in the forest) do not match the explicit description. Therefore the correct answer is c.

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement — it asserts that the tortoise and the hare "started their race at the same time."  
Step 2: The sentence explicitly states they began simultaneously, so the claim is true by direct reading.  
Therefore the correct choice is (a) True. Option (b) False is incorrect because it contradicts the given statement.

Question:
The tortoise crossed the finish line __________.

Options:
a. first
b. last
c. before the hare woke up
d. after the hare


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: From the well-known fable "The Tortoise and the Hare", the tortoise wins the race by steady progress while the hare sleeps, so the tortoise crossed the finish line first. Therefore option a (first) is correct. Options b (last) and d (after the hare) contradict the outcome of the race, and option c (before the hare woke up) is not the standard concise completion of the sentence.

Question:
How did the hare feel when he woke up?

Options:


Correct Answer: He felt shocked and furious.

Solution:
Solution:  
Step 1 — Locate the textual clue: find the sentence describing the hare immediately after he woke up.  
Step 2 — Read the verbs and adjectives used there: the passage explicitly describes the hare as being “shocked” and “furious” (or uses synonyms indicating sudden anger and surprise). Those words directly name his feelings.  
Step 3 — Conclude: therefore the correct answer is that he felt shocked and furious.  

Why other choices are wrong: options like “calm,” “happy,” or “confused” contradict the explicit emotional words in the text (they do not match the described surprise and anger), so they are incorrect.

Question:
What did the hare do during the race?

Options:
a. He ran all the way
b. He took a nap
c. He cheered for the tortoise
d. He got lost


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the classic story of the tortoise and the hare — the hare, being overconfident about his speed, stopped during the race to rest.  
Step 2: That action is described as taking a nap, so the correct choice is option b (He took a nap).  
Step 3: The other options are incorrect because he did not run the whole way (he stopped), he did not simply cheer for the tortoise, and he did not get lost — his loss was due to sleeping.

Question:
The tortoise was happy when he won the race.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and identify the main clause — "The tortoise was happy" — which directly states the tortoise's emotional state.  
Step 2: Note the subordinate clause "when he won the race" gives the reason/time for that happiness. Since the sentence explicitly says the tortoise "was happy" upon winning, the statement is true.  
Therefore the correct answer is a (True); option b (False) is incorrect because it contradicts the explicit wording of the sentence.

Question:
When the hare woke up, he realized that the tortoise was __________.

Options:
a. behind him
b. almost at the finish line
c. still sleeping
d. lost


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the common story context — the hare took a nap while the tortoise kept moving steadily.  
Step 2: When the hare woke up, he saw that because the tortoise had continued without stopping, it was nearly finished, so the correct choice is "almost at the finish line" (option b).  
Why the others are wrong: option a ("behind him") contradicts the tale where the tortoise overtakes the sleeping hare; option c ("still sleeping") is impossible because the tortoise had been moving; option d ("lost") is irrelevant to the race outcome.

Question:
What lesson can we learn from the story?

Options:


Correct Answer: Hard work and consistency can lead to success.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the protagonist’s actions — they repeatedly practiced, kept working even after failures, and improved gradually.  
Step 2: Link those actions to the outcome — because of steady effort and perseverance they eventually succeeded, so the cause (hard work + consistency) explains the effect (success).  
Step 3: Conclude the lesson — the correct answer is that hard work and consistency can lead to success.  

Brief note on other options: choices that emphasize only luck, talent without effort, or giving up are inconsistent with the story’s events, which show deliberate practice and persistence as the key factors.

Question:
Who were watching the race?

Options:
a. The other animals

d. Only the tortoise


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the passage (the race story) the text states that the spectators were the other animals who came to watch the contest between the hare and the tortoise.  
Step 2: That directly matches option a: "The other animals."  
Step 3: The other options are incorrect because "No one" contradicts the stated spectators, and "Only the hare" or "Only the tortoise" cannot be watchers since they were the participants.  
Therefore the correct answer is a.

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the statement — it asserts that the tortoise came to a stop during the race.  
Step 2: From the race context (the tortoise’s steady progress), the tortoise did not stop moving; it continued and finished the race, so the claim is false.  
Therefore the correct choice is b (False). Option a (True) is incorrect because it contradicts the observed steady motion of the tortoise.

Question:
The hare said, 'I am the __________ animal.'

Options:
a. slowest
b. fastest
c. smartest
d. biggest


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Recognize that a hare is commonly known for its speed, so the sentence needs a superlative describing quickness. Step 2 — Grammatically and contextually the correct word is "fastest", so the completed sentence is "I am the fastest animal." Step 3 — Eliminate the others: "slowest" contradicts the hare's known trait, and "smartest"/"biggest" are not typical distinguishing features. Correct answer: (b) fastest.

Question:
Describe the hare's attitude before the race.

Options:


Correct Answer: He was overconfident and looked down on the tortoise.

Solution:
Step 1: Identify textual clues — the hare laughed at and mocked the tortoise, boasted about its speed, and relaxed/confidently stopped during the race.  
Step 2: Interpret those behaviors — laughing, boasting and underestimating an opponent show arrogance and excessive self-confidence.  
Step 3: Conclude — the hare was overconfident and looked down on the tortoise.  
Why other options are incorrect: being humble or anxious would contradict the hare’s mocking and boastful actions, so those do not match the evidence.

Question:
How did the tortoise approach the race?

Options:
a. He was very nervous
b. He walked slowly but steadily
c. He tried to run fast
d. He didn't want to race


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the familiar fable of the tortoise and the hare, the tortoise’s characteristic approach was to move slowly but with consistent effort.  
Step 2: Compare this to the options: option b ("He walked slowly but steadily") exactly matches that description, so it is correct.  
Step 3: The other options are incorrect because (a) being very nervous is not the defining trait, (c) trying to run fast contradicts the tortoise’s slow pace, and (d) saying he didn't want to race is false since he did participate.
