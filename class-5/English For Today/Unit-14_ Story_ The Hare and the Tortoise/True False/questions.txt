--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
The tortoise won the race because he was faster than the hare, who took a nap during the competition.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — analyze the factual and causal claims in the sentence. The statement asserts two things: (1) the tortoise won the race, and (2) the reason was that he was faster than the hare, who took a nap.

Step 1: Check factual/canonical background. In the well-known Aesop fable, the tortoise does win, but he is not faster; the hare is faster but loses because he becomes overconfident and takes a nap.

Step 2: Evaluate the causal claim. The sentence says the tortoise won because he was faster. That gives a wrong cause — the win is explained by greater speed. In the fable the correct explanation is the tortoise’s steady persistence and the hare’s mistake (napping), not superior speed of the tortoise.

Step 3: Logical conclusion. For the given causal statement to be true both the comparative speed claim and the causal link must hold. The comparative speed claim is false (tortoise was slower), so the overall statement is false.

Answer: b (False).

Explanation:
False — the tortoise did not win because he was faster; he won because he kept moving steadily while the faster hare stopped to nap. This shows that consistent effort and avoiding mistakes can beat higher speed if the faster competitor makes poor choices.

Question #12 (ID: 100025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type: True False | Book: English For Today | Years:  | Boards:  | Tags: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
The tortoise won the race because he ran faster than the hare.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer: False (option b).

Approach:
- Examine the causal claim: "The tortoise won because he ran faster than the hare."
- Check whether winning requires greater speed or can result from other factors (e.g., interruptions, steady pace).

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Define variables for a simple model: let the race distance be [math]D[/math], the tortoise speed [math]v_t[/math] and the hare speed [math]v_h[/math] with [math]v_h > v_t[/math] (hare is faster).
2. If the tortoise runs continuously, his finish time is [math]t_t = \frac{D}{v_t}[/math].
3. If the hare pauses (sleeps or stops) for time [math]T[/math], his finish time is [math]t_h = \frac{D}{v_h} + T[/math].
4. The tortoise wins when [math]t_t  D\left(\frac{1}{v_t} - \frac{1}{v_h}\right)[/math].
5. This shows the tortoise can win even though [math]v_t < v_h[/math], provided the hare is delayed long enough. Therefore the cause of victory is not higher speed but the hare’s delay combined with the tortoise’s steady progress.

Relevant concepts:
- Distinguish speed (instantaneous rate) from outcome causation.
- A slower competitor can win if a faster competitor is interrupted or stops.

Conclusion:
The statement is false: the tortoise did not win because he ran faster than the hare; he won because he kept going while the faster hare was delayed.

Explanation:
Explanation: False — the tortoise did not run faster than the hare; he won because of steady, consistent progress and the hare’s overconfidence and resting during the race. This shows that persistence and reliability can beat greater speed if the faster competitor is careless.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
The hare was confident he would win the race, despite taking a nap.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Interpret the statement:
The sentence claims that the hare remained confident he would win the race even though he took a nap. The key word "despite" expresses that taking a nap did not reduce his confidence.

Step 2 — Check against the known account (Aesop’s fable "The Tortoise and the Hare"):
In that story the hare is overconfident about winning, pauses to rest and takes a nap during the race, believing he will still beat the tortoise. His confidence remains despite the nap.

Step 3 — Reasoning and conclusion:
Because the hare’s attitude in the story is explicitly described as confident even while napping, the statement is accurate. Therefore the correct answer is True (a).

Answer: True (a)

Explanation:
Explanation: The sentence explicitly states the hare was confident he would win the race even though he took a nap, so the statement is true. The word "despite" shows a contrast—his confidence remained despite the nap—so the claim matches the sentence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
The tortoise felt angry after losing the race and did not want to race again.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach: Compare the statement with the original story behavior of the tortoise (for example, in "The Tortoise and the Hare") and look for textual evidence about the tortoise’s feelings and intentions after the race.

Step 1 — Recall key facts: In the fable the tortoise is steady, patient and determined. He wins by persistence and does not react with anger; his success is a result of calm perseverance rather than spite.

Step 2 — Check the statement against the facts: The statement claims the tortoise "felt angry after losing the race and did not want to race again." This contradicts the story—first, the tortoise did not lose the race; he won. Second, there is no indication that he was angry or refused to race again.

Conclusion: The statement is False. Correct option: b (False).

Explanation:
Explanation: False — the tortoise did not lose the race; he won by steady persistence while the hare lost due to overconfidence. The story shows the tortoise was not angry or discouraged about racing again, but proved that patience and consistency succeed.

Question:
The lesson of the story emphasizes that being slow but steady can lead to success.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Answer: True (option a).

Approach:
Identify the central moral of the story and compare it to the proverb “slow and steady wins the race.” Determine whether the story’s events and outcome support the idea that consistent, patient effort leads to success.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Identify evidence from the story: show that a character who proceeds steadily, persists despite setbacks, and maintains consistent effort ultimately achieves the goal while a faster but careless character fails.  
2. Apply the principle: the lesson highlights virtues like persistence, consistency, patience, and avoiding overconfidence—these are the core ideas behind “slow but steady.”  
3. Infer the conclusion: because the story demonstrates that gradual, reliable progress outlasts speed combined with recklessness, the moral is that being slow but steady can lead to success.

Relevant concept:
- The proverb “slow and steady wins the race” captures the principle that sustained, disciplined effort often produces better outcomes than intermittent bursts of speed with poor planning or arrogance.

Example (brief, to illustrate value): the classic fable of the tortoise and the hare: the tortoise’s steady pace and persistence lead to victory, while the hare’s speed plus complacency causes failure—directly supporting the statement.

Conclusion:
The statement accurately reflects the story’s lesson, so the correct answer is True.

Question:
The hare and the tortoise started their race at the river.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
প্রশ্নটি যাচাই করার পদ্ধতি: মূল বক্তব্যটি (hare and tortoise started their race at the river) পরীক্ষা করতে হলে অনুচ্ছেদ/কাহিনীর উৎস অনুসন্ধান করে দেখা দরকার যে কোথা থেকে দৌড় শুরু হয়েছে। যদি কাহিনীতে নদীর উল্লেখ না থাকে বা শুরুবিন্দু অন্য কোথাও বলা থাকে, তাহলে উক্তিটি মিথ্যা হবে।

প্রধান যুক্তি ও ব্যাখ্যা:
- ক্লাসিক কাহিনী অনুযায়ী (the hare and the tortoise) তারা একে অপরের সঙ্গে প্রতিযোগিতা করে এবং সাধারণত রাস্তা বা শুরুলাইন থেকে दौঁড় শুরু করে—নদীর তীর থেকে নয়।  
- প্রশ্নে সরাসরি বলা হয়নি যে তারা নদীর কাছ থেকে শুরু করেছে, এবং কাহিনীর প্রচলিত বিবরণ থেকে এই দাবি সমর্থিত নয়।  
- তাই যে বিবরণটি (started their race at the river) তা কাহিনীর বর্ণনার সঙ্গে সঙ্গত নয়; ফলে বিবৃতিটি মিথ্যা।

উপসংহার: সঠিক উত্তর: b (False)

Explanation:
False. In the fable the race begins at a starting point on land (a track or road), not at a river, so the statement that they started at the river is incorrect.
