30/A TilpaparaKhilgaon, DhakaDecember 20, 2025Dear Mahi,Hope you are well by the grace of almighty Allah. I am also well by His grace. However, when I visited your house last month, I saw the surrounding area of your house is unclean. It is very bad. So, today I will tell you about the importance of clean environment.To ensure good health clean environment is a must. Because, clean environment prevents illness and sickness. In an unclean environment germs and diseases spread more quickly. A dirty environment not only causes infection but also hampers our mental health. It also spreads extremely bad smell. If our surrounding environment is clean, our mind also remain fresh. And with a fresh mind we can concentrate on our work well. So, for our overall well-being we must keep our surrounding environment clean.That's all today. Convey my salam to your parents and love to the youngers.Yours loving friendAnisha
