Options:


Correct Answer: Sima enjoys walking in the park and singing, while Biju prefers swimming and painting, which involves more physical activity.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach:
Identify each person’s stated leisure activities, assess those activities for physical engagement (low, moderate, high) and for typical social interaction (solitary, small-group, communal), then compare.

Step-by-step working:
1. List activities:
   - Sima: walking in the park, singing.
   - Biju: swimming, painting.

2. Assess physical engagement:
   - Walking in the park: moderate physical activity — involves continuous movement, cardiovascular benefit but low impact.
   - Singing: low physical exertion — primarily vocal activity, may have small physical elements (breathing, posture).
   - Swimming: high physical activity — whole-body aerobic and strength effort.
   - Painting: low physical activity — mostly stationary fine-motor use.

3. Assess social interaction:
   - Walking in the park: can be solitary or social (walking with friends or groups); generally flexible.
   - Singing: often social (choirs, karaoke) but can also be solitary practice; tends toward social expression.
   - Swimming: can be solitary (laps alone) or social (swim teams, classes); often more individual training-focused.
   - Painting: usually solitary or small-group (classes, studios); typically less socially interactive than group sports or singing.

Logical comparison and conclusion:
- In terms of physical engagement, Biju’s leisure (swimming) involves more intense physical activity than Sima’s activities; overall Biju’s mix (swimming + painting) is more physically demanding because swimming is high-intensity while Sima’s activities are moderate-to-low intensity.
- In terms of social interaction, Sima’s activities (walking and singing) have a higher tendency for social involvement (walking with others, group singing) compared with Biju’s activities, which are more likely to be solitary or small-group (especially painting), though both persons’ activities can be either solitary or social depending on context.

Concise summary:
Sima prefers walking and singing (moderate-to-low physical effort, more socially flexible and often social), while Biju prefers swimming and painting (swimming gives higher physical exertion; painting is low physical and often more solitary).

Question:
How do Sima and Biju's leisure activities compare in terms of fitness and enjoyment?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Identify each person’s leisure activities.
- Classify each activity by primary purpose (fitness-focused or enjoyment/social/mental).
- Compare based on physiological benefits and subjective enjoyment.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. List activities:
   - Biju: swimming.
   - Sima: walking and singing.

2. Classify activities by primary effect:
   - Swimming is a full-body aerobic and resistance exercise that improves cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength, and endurance. Therefore its primary focus is physical fitness.
   - Walking is a light to moderate physical activity that can provide gentle fitness benefits (cardiovascular health, mood improvement) but is often done for relaxation or enjoyment. Singing is primarily a recreational and expressive activity that promotes mental well‑being, social connection, and enjoyment rather than significant physical fitness.

3. Compare:
   - In terms of fitness: Biju’s swimming is more explicitly fitness-oriented and yields greater measurable physical benefits than Sima’s walking or singing.
   - In terms of enjoyment: Sima’s activities (walking and especially singing) emphasize enjoyment, relaxation, and emotional satisfaction more than intense fitness.

Conclusion:
- Biju focuses on swimming for fitness while Sima enjoys walking and singing for enjoyment.

Explanation:
Biju focuses on swimming as his leisure activity to keep fit, while Sima prefers walking and singing mainly for enjoyment. Swimming is a more vigorous, fitness-oriented exercise that builds strength and endurance, whereas walking and singing are gentler, recreational activities valued for relaxation and pleasure.
