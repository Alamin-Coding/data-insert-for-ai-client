Question:
What does the poem by Eleanor Farjeon compare about the city and the country?

Options:


Correct Answer: The city has streets, while the country has roads.

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Read the poem lines that set up a contrast and identify the key nouns used for the city and the country.

Step 1: Locate the contrasting line(s) in the poem that compare the two settings. The poem explicitly names what each place “has.”

Step 2: Note the exact words: the poem says the city has “streets” and the country has “roads.” These are the two items being contrasted.

Concepts and reasoning — The poet uses common nouns to highlight differences in setting and atmosphere: “streets” implies a built, urban environment with closely spaced buildings, sidewalks and organized thoroughfares; “roads” suggests rural paths linking fields and villages, often more open and less structured. The contrast is simple and literal, emphasizing how language evokes different kinds of places.

Conclusion — The poem compares that the city has streets, while the country has roads. This direct contrast is the poem’s intended comparison.

Explanation:
The poem contrasts a simple physical difference: the city is described as having "streets" while the country is described as having "roads." This comparison highlights how urban areas use streets (built, lined with buildings and sidewalks) and rural areas use roads (longer routes connecting open places), using familiar words to show the different characters of each setting.

Question:
In the poem about the city and country, what contrasts with the 'big trams' in the city?

Options:


Correct Answer: The hedgerows and trees in the country.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach:
- Identify the urban image given in the poem (“big trams”) and find the corresponding rural images the poet places in contrast.
- Compare their qualities (shape, movement, sound, origin) and explain how they create a deliberate contrast between city and country.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Locate the images: the poem explicitly mentions “big trams” as a prominent urban element. The country side is described with natural features — hedgerows and trees.
2. Compare the images:
   - Origin and nature: “Big trams” are mechanical, man-made, urban; hedgerows and trees are natural, living, rural.
   - Visual and sensory contrast: trams suggest hard lines, metal, noise and mass; hedgerows and trees suggest softer forms, growth, green color and quiet rustle.
   - Movement and rhythm: trams move on fixed tracks with regularity; hedgerows and trees imply organic growth and gentle, irregular motion (wind in leaves).
3. Interpret the poet’s intent: by juxtaposing “big trams” with “hedgerows and trees,” the poet emphasizes the difference between bustling, constructed city life and the calmer, natural countryside. The hedgerows and trees therefore function as the direct contrast to the city’s trams.

Final answer:
The hedgerows and trees in the country contrast with the “big trams” in the city.

Explanation:
The hedgerows and trees in the country contrast with the "big trams" because the trams represent the noisy, man-made, urban environment while hedgerows and trees evoke the quiet, natural countryside. The poem uses this urban vs. rural contrast to show different atmospheres and moods.
