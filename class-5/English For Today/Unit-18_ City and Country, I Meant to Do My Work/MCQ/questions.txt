Question:
Which location is described as having streets?

Options:
a. The country
b. A park
c. The city
d. A village


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: "Streets" usually refers to paved public roads laid out in an urban area with buildings and addresses — a typical feature of a city.  
Step 2: Compare options: a) a country is a large region (may contain cities but "streets" are not the defining feature), b) a park has paths or walkways rather than streets, d) a village has lanes or roads but not the formal streets of a city.  
Conclusion: the correct choice is c (the city).

Question:
The author prefers the city over the country.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the passage carefully and locate sentences where the author expresses likes or dislikes about the city and the country.  
Step 2: Note textual evidence (positive adjectives for the country, negative remarks about city life, or explicit statements preferring rural life). Such evidence shows the author favors the country over the city.  
Step 3: Therefore the statement "The author prefers the city over the country" is incorrect, so the correct choice is b (False). Option a is wrong because it contradicts the passage's clear preference for the country.

Question:
The text contrasts city streets with __________.

Options:
a. city parks
b. country roads
c. suburban paths
d. urban squares


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1) Identify the key phrase: the sentence sets up a contrast with "city streets," so the correct choice should represent a non-city (rural) counterpart.  
2) Compare options: (a) city parks and (d) urban squares are also urban, (c) suburban paths are near cities, while (b) country roads clearly represent rural roads.  
3) Therefore the contrast is with country roads, so the correct answer is (b).

Question:
What is the poet's main feeling about the country?

Options:


Correct Answer: The poet wishes to return to the country.

Solution:
সমাধান:
প্রথম ধাপ: কবিতার ভাষা ও ভাবনা থেকে এমন লাইন ও শব্দ চিহ্নিত করুন যা দেশ সম্পর্কে অনুভূতি প্রকাশ করে — যেমন স্মৃতি, কষ্ট, আকাঙ্ক্ষা বা প্রত্যাবর্তনের ইচ্ছা।  
দ্বিতীয় ধাপ: যদি কবি বারবার দেশের কথা মনে করে, ফিরে যেতে চায় বা দেশের জন্য কষ্ট বরণ করার ইঙ্গিত দেয়, তাহলে প্রধান অনুভূতিটিকে "দেশে ফিরে যাওয়ার আকাঙ্ক্ষা" হিসেবে ব্যাখ্যা করা যায়।  
তৃতীয় ধাপ: উপরোক্ত বিশ্লেষণের আলোকে সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে—কবি দেশে ফিরে যেতে চায়। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো (উদাহরণস্বরূপ গর্ব, দেশাত্মবোধের অনুপস্থিতি বা বিরোধিতা) কবিতায় যদি দৃঢ়ভাবে প্রকাশ পায় না বা ফিরে যাওয়ার ইচ্ছার চিহ্ন মুছতে না পারে, তাই সেগুলো অস্বীকারযোগ্য।

Options:

d. Buses


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নে উল্লেখিত টেক্সট থেকে শহরের যানবাহনের নাম খুঁজে বের করুন—টেক্সটে স্পষ্টভাবে "trams" (ট্রাম) উল্লেখ আছে।  
ধাপ ২: যেহেতু মাত্র ট্রামের কথা বলা হয়েছে, তাই বিকল্পগুলোর মধ্যে যে অপশনটি ট্রাম নির্দেশ করে তা বেছে নিন।  
উপসংহার: অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হল b (Trams)। অন্য অপশনগুলি (Bicycles, Cars, Buses) টেক্সটে উল্লেখ নেই, তাই সেগুলি ভুল।

b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poem carefully and locate any line or phrase that refers to hedgerows or similar boundary plantings.  
Step 2: The poem explicitly mentions hedgerows (it describes the country having hedgerows), so the statement is accurate.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is True; option b (False) is incorrect because it contradicts the poem's explicit mention.

Question:
The butterfly was __________ across the field.

Options:
a. flying
b. hiding
c. jumping
d. running


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the subject and context — "the butterfly" is an animate insect moving "across the field," so we need a verb that denotes movement through the air.  
Step 2: Choose the verb form that fits tense and meaning — "was flying" correctly matches the past continuous action of moving across the field, so option a is correct.  
Explanation of others: "hiding" implies being concealed rather than moving across, "jumping" is unlikely for a butterfly, and "running" does not suit an insect that flies.

Question:
What does the poet mean by saying leaves were calling him?

Options:


Correct Answer: It suggests that nature is inviting him to enjoy its beauty.

Solution:
Step 1: চিহ্নিতকরণ — বাক্যটিতে "leaves were calling him" একটি অলঙ্কারিক রীতি, অর্থাৎ personification (জীবন্তবস্তুকে মানুষের বৈশিষ্ট্য দেওয়া)।  
Step 2: ব্যাখ্যা — এখানে "calling" মানে আডম্বর বা ডাক নয়, বরং প্রকৃতি যেন তাকে আমন্ত্রণ জানাচ্ছে; পাতারা তাকে বাইরে এসে প্রকৃতির সৌন্দর্য উপভোগ করতে আহ্বান করছে।  
Step 3: উপসংহার — তাই সঠিক অর্থ হচ্ছে: প্রকৃতি তাকে তার সৌন্দর্য উপভোগ করতে আমন্ত্রণ জানাচ্ছে। বিকল্প ব্যাখ্যা (যেমন পাতার বাস্তবশব্দ বা বিপদের সংকেত) সাধারণত প্রাসঙ্গিক নয় কারণ কবিতার ভাষায় personification-ই স্বাভাবিক ব্যাখ্যা।

Which of the following does the poet mention seeing in the city?

Options:
a. Farms
b. Horses
c. Lamp-posts
d. Rivers


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Read the lines of the poem and locate the objects the poet explicitly describes. The poet mentions seeing "lamp-posts" in the city, so option c is correct. 

Reasoning: the text directly names lamp-posts as a city feature; farms and rivers are typically rural and are not mentioned, and horses are not described in the city context in the poem. Hence the correct answer is c.

Options:
a. True

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Read the claim—“both city and country are described as peaceful and inviting.”  
Step 2: Check the text: the country is described as peaceful and inviting, but the city is described as busy/noisy (not peaceful). These descriptions contradict the claim that both are peaceful.  
Step 3: Conclude the claim is false, so the correct answer is b. Option a is incorrect because it asserts the claim is true despite the city being depicted as not peaceful.

A __________ held out its shining hand in the poem.

Options:

b. cloud
c. rainbow
d. star


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The phrase "held out its shining hand" is a personification describing something bright and appearing to reach out across the sky — a feature typical of a rainbow's shining, arched form.  
Step 2: Eliminate other options: the sun and star do shine but are usually depicted as a disk or a point rather than an outstretched hand, and a cloud does not "shine" in that sense.  
Therefore the correct answer is c: rainbow.

Question:
Why did the poet ultimately not do his work?

Options:


Correct Answer: He was distracted by the beauty of nature.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for textual clues — the poet’s lines describe pausing to watch the sky, birds, breeze or flowers, which shows his attention shifted to the surroundings.  
Step 2: Interpret those clues: vivid sensory details and lingering observation indicate distraction by nature rather than an inability or deliberate refusal to work.  
Step 3: Conclude that the best choice is “He was distracted by the beauty of nature.”  
Other options (e.g., laziness, illness, lack of time) are not supported by the poem’s emphasis on enjoyment of natural beauty, so they are less likely.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence in the passage that says what the author planned to do and identify the key verb describing the activity.  
Step 2: The key verb indicates the author planned to do "writing" (so the activity matches option c).  
Step 3: Therefore choose option c (Writing work). Options a, b, and d are incorrect because the passage does not mention garden work, school work, or household chores as the intended activity.

Both poems express a preference for urban living.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the claim — it says both poems prefer urban living.  
Step 2: Check each poem’s tone and imagery: at least one poem uses pastoral/nature imagery and praises rural life or criticizes the city, so it does not express a preference for urban living.  
Step 3: Conclusion — because not both poems favor the city, the statement is false; therefore the correct answer is b (False). Option a (True) is incorrect because it requires both poems to express urban preference, which the texts do not support.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the ending carefully and identify the final action or intention the author describes.
2. The closing lines indicate the author leaves the house or expresses intent to step outside, so the final decision is to go outside.
3. Therefore option (b) is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because the text does not state the author stayed home, completed work, or went to sleep.

Options:

Solution:
Solution: Read the lines carefully and note which natural things are described as "calling" to the poet. The poem explicitly names a bird, a butterfly, the leaves, and the wind as calling to the speaker, so the correct choice lists those four. Other options are incorrect because they either omit one of these items or include things (e.g., flowers or streams) that the lines do not mention.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the choices and identify which one matches the statement that rain is positively compared to the sun — option (b) says it is "described as sweet."  
Step 2: Eliminate the others: (a) "less appreciated" implies a negative or indifferent attitude, (c) "seen as burdensome" is clearly negative, and (d) "causes floods" is a specific harmful outcome; none of these convey a pleasant comparison.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is (b) because it directly states the rain is characterized as sweet, matching the positive comparison.

Question:
The poet expresses regret about being in nature.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Interpret the statement — it claims the poet feels regret about being in nature (i.e., sorrow or lament). Check the poem’s tone and wording: if the poet uses positive images, admiration, joy, or peaceful descriptions of nature and there are no words or lines expressing sorrow, apology, or longing to leave, then the claim of “regret” is unsupported. Therefore the statement is false; the correct answer is b (False), and option a (True) is incorrect because the poem does not show regret.

Step 2: All options (red, blue, green, yellow) are adjectives that agree with the plural noun, so grammar does not eliminate any choice.

Question:
How does the poet feel when he thinks of the country?

Options:


Correct Answer: He feels a longing to return and be in the country.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the words and images in the poem that express the poet’s inner state — phrases that suggest memory, homesickness, or a wish to be back in familiar surroundings indicate an emotional pull toward the country.  
Step 2: From those cues we infer the dominant feeling is a longing to return and be in the country, not mere pride or anger.  
Brief note on other choices: options such as simple happiness, anger, or indifference are incorrect because the poem’s tone and specific phrases convey yearning and desire for reunion rather than those emotions.

Solution:

Compare these items to the options: option c ("Hay, mangolds, and grain") exactly matches the poem's list, so it is correct. The other options mention cars and bicycles, mountains and skyscrapers, or buildings and streets, none of which are the agricultural items named in the poem, so they are incorrect.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Step 1: Read the phrase "went sighing over the land" and identify which subject typically makes a "sighing" sound when moving over land.  
Step 2: The wind is commonly described as "sighing" as it moves, so option c (wind) best fits the image and verb choice.  
Step 3: Options a (clouds), b (sun), and d (birds) are less suitable because clouds and sun do not produce a sighing sound and birds would be described differently (singing, chirping), so the correct answer is c.

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে লেখাটি মনোযোগ দিয়ে পড়ুন এবং শহর ও গ্রাম/দেশের মধ্যে যে বর্ণনা বা বস্তুগুলোর উল্লেখ আছে তা আলাদা করে তালিকাভুক্ত করুন। লেখায় শহরের জন্য মনে রাখা মূল নিদর্শন হলো রাস্তা (streets) ও ট্রাম/ট্রান্সপোর্টের মত নগরী যানবাহন, আর গ্রামের/দেশের জন্য উল্লিখিত নিদর্শন হলো পথ (roads) ও খোলা প্রকৃতি — ক্ষেত, গাছ, নদী ইত্যাদি। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল যে শহরে রাস্তা ও ট্রাম আছে, আর দেশে পথ ও প্রাকৃতিক উপাদানগুলো আছে। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ সেগুলো লেখার সরাসরি বর্ণনার সঙ্গে মেলে না (উদাহরণস্বরূপ, শহরকে প্রকৃতির সাথে মূলত যুক্ত করা বা গ্রামে ট্রাম থাকা বললেই তা লেখার বর্ণনার বিরুদ্ধ)।

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Step 2: Match those cues to the options: option b ("Sweet-smelling and peaceful") directly corresponds to scent and tranquility described.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a ("Noisy and busy") contradicts peaceful imagery, option c ("Dirty and polluted") contradicts sweet-smelling language, and option d ("Dark and empty") contradicts the sense of warmth or life implied.  

Therefore the correct answer is b: Sweet-smelling and peaceful.

Question:
The poem suggests that nature is a distraction from responsibilities.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the poem carefully and mark lines where the speaker responds to nature rather than attending to duties (words or phrases indicating lingering, forgetting tasks, or choosing leisure).
2. Check for contrasts or causal language that link the speaker’s attention to nature with neglect of responsibilities (e.g., verbs like “forgot,” “lingered,” “escaped,” or explicit contrasts between work and the natural scene).
3. If the poem consistently shows the speaker abandoning or postponing obligations to enjoy nature, the theme is that nature distracts from responsibilities.
Conclusion: Based on that evidence, the correct choice is a: True. Option b is incorrect because it denies the textual indications that the speaker’s attention to nature leads to neglect of duties.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
The idiomatic phrase is "meant to do his work" — "work" naturally follows "do his" to indicate tasks or duties, so option (c) is correct. Options (a) "study" would usually be "do his studies" or used as a verb, (b) "homework" is possible but less likely for a poet in typical context, and (d) "laundry" is unlikely given the meaning.

Question:
What does the repetition of 'Oh, take me away to the country again!' indicate?

Options:


Correct Answer: It indicates a strong desire to escape to the country.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Note that the line is repeated exactly, which in poetry is a device to add emphasis.  
Step 2: Repetition here heightens emotion and urgency, so the speaker’s plea to be taken "to the country again" is intensified.  
Step 3: Therefore the repetition indicates a strong desire to escape to the country; other choices (e.g., mere description or neutral statement) are less fitting because they don’t account for the emotional emphasis created by repetition.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The text describes both urban and rural environments, so the main settings are "city" and "country".

Question:
The poet expresses a preference for the city.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: পড়া ও নিরীক্ষা — প্রথমে কবিতার এমন কিছু অংশ খুঁজে বের করুন যেখানে নগর এবং গ্রামের বর্ণনা, অনুভূতি বা শব্দচয়ন আছে।  
Step 2: সুর ও শব্দের বিশ্লেষণ — যদি কবি গ্রামকে প্রাণবান, শান্ত বা প্রশান্তিময় শব্দে বর্ণনা করে এবং নগরকে কোলাহল, কষ্ট বা নেগেটিভ শব্দে তুলে ধরে, তাহলে কবির প্রাধান্য গ্রামের পক্ষে বুঝে নেওয়া যায়।  
Step 3: সিদ্ধান্ত — কবির ভাষা ও মনোভাব যদি শহরের পক্ষে সাড়া না দেয় এবং গ্রামের প্রতি আকর্ষণ প্রকাশ করে, তাহলে “The poet expresses a preference for the city.” বক্তব্যটি মিথ্যাই। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো b (False)।  

কেন a (True) ভুল: কারণ তথ্যে কবি শহরের প্রশংসা করে এমন প্রমাণ নেই; বরং গ্রামের প্রতি ইতিবাচক অনুভূতি থাকলে শহরকে প্রাধান্য দেওয়া হয় না।

Question:
The country is described as having __________.

Options:
a. skyscrapers
b. hedgerows
c. cars
d. buildings


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the phrase "The country is described as having _________" and consider which option describes a typical rural landscape feature.  
Step 2: Compare options: "hedgerows" are linear rows of shrubs dividing fields (a common countryside feature), while "skyscrapers" are urban, and "cars" or "buildings" are too general.  
Step 3: Therefore the best choice is b: hedgerows, because it specifically matches a countryside description.

Question:
What feelings does the poet associate with the country?

Options:


Correct Answer: Joy and longing to return

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the lines describing the poet’s feelings and note words or images that convey emotion (bright, warm, beloved, recall, return, etc.).  
Step 2: Identify two distinct emotional tones: positive delight in the country’s qualities (joy) and a repeated wish to be back (longing to return).  
Step 3: Conclude that the best answer is “Joy and longing to return” because the poem uses joyful imagery and explicit expressions of desire to go home.  
Other options (e.g., grief, anger, indifference) are incorrect because the text lacks negative or detached language and instead emphasizes pleasure and yearning.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Identify which options refer to natural features. Both hedgerows (rows of shrubs or bushes) and trees are natural vegetation, so b is correct. Options a (rivers and lakes) are natural too but the given correct answer is b, while c (buildings and streets) and d (cars and shops) are man-made and thus not natural.

Question:
The poem 'Meant to Do My Work' features distractions from nature.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the speaker’s intent — the poem begins with the speaker saying they meant to do their work, showing an initial plan to be productive.  
Step 2: Note the interruptions — shortly after, natural elements (for example, a bird, flowers, sunlight, or other pastoral images) draw the speaker’s attention away and cause delay.  
Step 3: Conclusion — because the poem explicitly shows the speaker being distracted by nature, the correct answer is True (option a). Option b is incorrect because it contradicts the poem’s clear depiction of nature as the source of distraction.

Question:
In the poem, the speaker was called by __________ in the countryside.

Options:
a. birds
b. cars
c. people
d. noise


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the line(s) of the poem describing the countryside; the speaker is described as being called by natural sounds typical of rural areas—specifically birds.  
Step 2: Eliminate other choices: cars (b) are unlikely in a quiet countryside setting described by the poem, people (c) would be explicitly mentioned if so, and noise (d) is too vague compared to the specific mention of birds.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a) birds.

Question:
Describe what the butterfly was doing in the poem.

Options:


Correct Answer: Flitting across the field

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the lines of the poem that describe the butterfly and underline the verbs or phrases used for its motion (words like "flit", "flutter", "dart", "over the grass/flowers").
Step 2: Those action words indicate quick, light movement rather than staying put. 
Step 3: Hence the correct description is that the butterfly was flitting across the field.
Brief note: Options such as "sitting on a flower" or "sleeping" contradict the active verbs in the poem, so they are incorrect.

How does the poet view the weather in the country?

Options:
a. Always sunny
b. As sweet as the sun
c. Too rainy
d. Boring


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poet’s description and note the comparison — the poet calls the country’s weather pleasant by likening it to the sun’s sweetness (a positive simile).  
Step 2: That direct comparison matches option b ("As sweet as the sun"), so choose that.  
Explanation of why others are wrong: option a ("Always sunny") is an absolute statement not implied by a simile; option c ("Too rainy") and option d ("Boring") contradict the positive, sweet description the poet uses.

The poem suggests that city life is preferred over country life.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the claim — check whether the poem explicitly or implicitly favors city life over country life.  
Step 2: Look for textual evidence — examine tone, adjectives, and scenes: if the poem praises rural scenes, peacefulness, or criticizes urban bustle, then it does not prefer city life.  
Conclusion: The correct answer is b (False), because the poem’s language and imagery do not indicate a preference for city life; therefore option a (True) is incorrect.

Question:
The speaker feels a connection with __________ in the country.

Options:
a. animals
b. nature
c. people
d. machines


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the phrase "feels a connection with __________ in the country" — this implies an emotional or spiritual bond with the environment one experiences in the countryside.  
Step 2: Among the options, "nature" best matches an emotional/spiritual connection to landscapes, trees, rivers, and the rural environment, so the correct choice is b: nature.  
Why others are incorrect: "animals" (a) is narrower (would mention animals specifically), "people" (c) refers to social connection rather than the setting, and "machines" (d) is unlikely in a country context and does not express an emotional bond.

Question:
What does the rainbow do in the poem?

Options:


Correct Answer: Held out its shining hand

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the poem line that describes the rainbow and note the exact wording — the poem says the rainbow "held out its shining hand," which is a direct description of the rainbow's action.
2. Interpret the imagery: this is a personification (treating the rainbow like a person) and it conveys an inviting, helping gesture — so the action is literally "held out its shining hand."
3. Conclusion: the correct answer is "Held out its shining hand." Other possible choices (e.g., "smiled" or "flew away") are incorrect because they do not match the poem's specific verb and image of an outstretched, shining hand.

Question:
What is contrasted with city life in the poems?

Options:
a. Suburban life
b. Country life
c. Village life
d. Ocean life


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poems and identify the contrasting images—mentions of open fields, farming, nature, quiet rhythms, and rural scenery versus noise, crowds, and industry of the city.  
Step 2: Match those rural images to the options: they describe life in the countryside, so the direct contrast is with country life.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: suburban life (a) implies areas near cities, not the open rural scenes shown; village life (c) is close but narrower in scope—“country life” (b) is the correct, broader contrast given in the poems; ocean life (d) is irrelevant.  
Therefore the correct answer is: b.

b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Step 1: Examine the poems' content and identify recurring themes (city joys, but also hardship, loneliness, nostalgia or social critique).  
Step 2: Find lines or stanzas that explicitly show themes other than joyful city life (e.g., descriptions of struggle, loss, or critical observation).  
Step 3: Because the poems include these additional themes, the statement that they focus solely on the joys of city life is false. Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
The author felt unable to complete __________ due to natural distractions.

Options:
a. homework
b. work
c. chores
d. reading


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: পদের অর্থ ও প্রসঙ্গ বিশ্লেষণ — বাক্যটি "The author felt unable to complete __________ due to natural distractions." থেকে বোঝা যায় খালি স্থানে এমন একটি কার্যনামক শব্দ যাবে যা "complete" (সম্পন্ন করা) এর সাথে সাধারণত ব্যবহৃত হয় এবং "natural distractions" দ্বারা ব্যাহত হতে পারে।

Step 2: উপযুক্ত বিকল্প নির্বাচন — "work" এখানে সবথেকে উপযুক্ত কারণ লেখকের নিজস্ব কাজ বা লেখাই প্রায়ই পরিবেশগত বিভ্রান্তির কারণে অসম্পূর্ণ থাকে; অতএব work (ব) সবচেয়ে সুসংগত।

কেন অন্যগুলো ভুল: "homework" সাধারণত ছাত্রের প্রসঙ্গ নির্দেশ করে, যা লেখকের প্রসঙ্গে সন্দেহজনক; "chores" ছোট দৈনন্দিন কাজ, সাধারণত দ্রুত করা যায় এবং প্রায়ই "complete" করার জন্য এই ধরনের বৃহৎ ব্যাখ্যা দেয় না; "reading" একটি অনবরত ক্রিয়া এবং প্রায়ই বলা হয় "unable to concentrate on reading" না যে "unable to complete reading" সম্পর্কিত প্রসঙ্গ কম প্রাসঙ্গিক। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো: work.

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the author's tone by looking for words or phrases that express feelings — if the text emphasizes crowding, noise, irritation, or repeated complaints, that signals overwhelm and dislike.
Step 2: Match that tone to the choices: the description of negative reactions and sensory overload corresponds to "A sense of overwhelm and dislike," so option A is correct.
Step 3: Why other options are incorrect: positive or neutral options would be supported by pleasant or calm language, which is absent; mere curiosity or admiration would use different, positive descriptors, so they don't fit the observed tone.

Options:
a. Fast
b. Rattling by
c. Brightly colored
d. Quiet


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the descriptive words the author uses for the trams—look for verbs or adjectives that indicate motion or sound.
Step 2: The phrase "rattling by" clearly describes both the noisy, clattering sound and the passing motion of the trams, so option b is the best match.
Step 3: Reject the others: (a) "Fast" focuses only on speed without the sound quality, (c) "Brightly colored" refers to appearance which is not implied, and (d) "Quiet" contradicts the noisy sense of "rattling." Hence the correct answer is b.

Options:

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: 읽 the poems for repeated imagery and language — frequent references to landscapes, seasons, plants, animals, sensory details, and personification indicate the speaker’s emotional bond with the natural world.
Step 2: Since those elements dominate the poems and link the speaker’s feelings to nature, the statement is True.
Step 3: Therefore option (a) is correct; option (b) is incorrect because it ignores the clear textual evidence of a deep connection with nature.

Step 2: Match each option to city or rural imagery: "Green pastures" and "flowing rivers" are rural, "wild animals" is unlikely in a city, while "Big trams" is a characteristic urban sight.

Question:
What longing does the poet express throughout the poems?

Options:


Correct Answer: Longing to return to the country

Solution:
Solution: 
Step 1 — Identify the recurring theme: scan the poems for repeated images and phrases (home, native landscape, childhood fields, desire to go back). These recurring motifs indicate the central emotional focus.  
Step 2 — Reasoning from evidence: because the poet repeatedly contrasts the present with memories of the homeland and expresses a yearning to cross distance or time, the clear emotional longing is to return to the country.  
Step 3 — Eliminate other options: the lines do not emphasize romantic love, material gain, or mere nostalgia for objects; they consistently point to a desire for physical and emotional return to the homeland. Hence the correct answer is: longing to return to the country.

c. গ্রামে বৃষ্টির জন্য প্রচুর মানুষ থাকে, শহরে কম
d. শহরে খাদ্য উৎপাদন বেশি, গ্রামে কম


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. প্রশ্নে শহর ও গ্রামের সাধারণ বৈশিষ্ট্যগুলিকে তুলনা করতে হবে। সাধারণভাবে গ্রামে বেশি গাছ ও মাঠ (কৃষি জমি) থাকে এবং শহরে বেশি যানবাহন ও উন্নত পরিবহন ব্যবস্থা (যেমন ট্রাম) থাকে — তাই বিকল্প a শহর ও গ্রামের বৈশিষ্ট্য ঠিকভাবে বর্ণনা করেছে।
2. অন্য বিকল্পগুলির ত্রুটি সংক্ষেপে:
- b: শহরে সাধারণত টিলা ও নদী বেশি হওয়া নয়; নদী বা টিলা স্থানভিত্তিক এবং গ্রামেই বেশি রাস্তা নেই—সাধারণভাবে শহরেই বেশি রাস্তা ও অবকাঠামো থাকে।
- c: বৃষ্টি এবং মানুষের সংখ্যা সম্পর্কিত এই বিবরণ অযৌক্তিক; বৃষ্টি হওয়া কোনও জায়গার জনসংখ্যা নির্ধারণ করে না।
- d: খাদ্য উৎপাদন সাধারণত গ্রামেরই বেশি (কৃষি হওয়ায়), শহরে নয়।

2. বিকল্পগুলোর তুলনা: (a) শহরের কষ্টকর পরিবেশের বর্ণনা এবং গ্রামে প্রাকৃতিক সৌন্দর্যের কথা বলা—এটিই সরাসরি শহরকে নেতিবাচক ও গ্রামকে ইতিবাচকভাবে উপস্থাপন করে, ফলে লেখকের অনীহা ও ভালোবাসা দুটোই প্রকাশ পায়। 

3. অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো ব্যাখ্যা: (b) কেবল গাছের উপস্থিতি/সংরক্ষণ নিয়ে বলছে—সামগ্রিক ভালোবাসা/অবহেলার বিস্তৃত চিত্র নয়; (c) বৃষ্টির মিষ্টতা বনাম ধুলোবালি সংক্ষেপে অনুভূতি দেখায় কিন্তু পুরোপুরি আদর্শ তুলনা নয়; (d) যানবাহন বনাম শান্তি তুলনা করলেও (a)’র মতো প্রাকৃতিক সৌন্দর্যের তুলনা এবং শহরের কষ্টকর পরিবেশের বিস্তৃত চিত্র দেয় না।
