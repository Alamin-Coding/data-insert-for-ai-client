Question:
What type of environment does the poet in 'City and Country' seem to prefer?

Options:


Correct Answer: The country

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Compare the images, tone and word-choice the poet uses for the city and for the country; the favored environment will have more positive imagery, calmer tone and welcoming details.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Identify contrasts: the poem contrasts busy, noisy, crowded city scenes with peaceful, open, natural country scenes.
2. Examine imagery and tone: the country is described with soothing, life‑affirming images (fields, fresh air, birds, quiet), while the city is portrayed with harsh, stressful images (noise, smoke, crowds).
3. Infer preference: because the poet uses warmer, positive vocabulary and a calmer tone for the countryside and negative, tense language for the city, the poet’s sympathy clearly lies with the country.

Conclusion — The poet seems to prefer the country.

Explanation:
The poet prefers the country; he praises its fresh air, quiet, open spaces and closeness to nature while contrasting them with the city's noise, crowding and artificial life. The poem’s positive imagery and tone toward rural scenes make his preference clear.

Question:
In the poem 'City and Country', what is described as blotting out the sky?

Options:


Correct Answer: The breath of the chimneys

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Locate the relevant line in the poem and identify the agent performing the action.
- Interpret the phrase using poetic devices (metaphor, personification) and the poem’s city-vs-country contrast.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. The line in question attributes the action “blotting out the sky” to a force coming from the city. The immediate phrase naming that force is “the breath of the chimneys.”
2. In poetic terms, “breath of the chimneys” personifies chimneys and stands for the smoke and fumes they emit. “Breath” here is a metaphor for smoke/industrial emissions.
3. “Blotting out the sky” describes how dense smoke obscures the sky—an image of pollution and industrial dominance in the city.
4. This interpretation is reinforced by the poem’s central contrast between urban (smoky, industrial) and rural (clear, natural) environments.

Conclusion:
- The poem describes “the breath of the chimneys” (i.e., smoke from chimneys) as blotting out the sky.

Explanation:
Explanation: The phrase "the breath of the chimneys" refers to the smoke and fumes produced by chimneys, which the poem portrays as blotting out the sky. This is a vivid image (personification and metaphor) showing how industrial smoke obscures and covers the sky, indicating pollution and the dominance of city industry.

Question:
What natural elements are mentioned in the poem 'City and Country' that are found in the country?

Options:


Correct Answer: Hedgerows and trees

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Scan the lines of the poem that describe the country, pick out words that name natural features, and contrast them with man-made elements mentioned for the city.

Steps and working:
1. Identify country-focused phrases in the poem (lines describing the rural scene).
2. From those lines, extract nouns that denote naturally occurring elements rather than built objects.
3. Verify that the extracted items (hedgerows, trees) are indeed natural landscape features typical of the countryside.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Natural elements: parts of the landscape produced by living organisms or natural growth (e.g., trees, hedgerows, fields, rivers).
- Man-made elements: constructed features (e.g., buildings, streets, lamps) which are not counted as natural.

Reasoning:
- The poem explicitly mentions hedgerows and trees in the country passages. Both are living, plant-based features that form part of the rural environment (hedgerows are lines of shrubs/plants used as field boundaries; trees are larger woody plants).
- Other items in the country description (if any) that are buildings or roads would be classified as man-made and therefore not counted here.

Answer:
The natural elements mentioned in the poem that are found in the country are hedgerows and trees.

Explanation:
The poem names "hedgerows" and "trees" as features found in the country, so those are the correct natural elements. These items are typical rural vegetation used in the poem to contrast the countryside with the built environment of the city.

Question:
What does the poet in 'Meant to Do My Work' get distracted by?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Read the poem carefully and identify the lines that describe what interrupts the poet’s intention to work.
- Extract the specific natural images mentioned and explain how they function as distractions.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. The poet begins with the intention to work but then notices elements of nature. By locating the descriptive lines, we find the two explicit distractions.
2. The poem names a "brown bird" whose singing attracts the poet’s attention and a "butterfly" that further diverts him. These are sensory, pleasant images—sound (birdsong) and sight/motion (butterfly)—which pull the poet away from his task.
3. Conceptually, the poem uses these natural details to show how beauty and curiosity interrupt planned duties; the poet yields to immediate pleasure instead of work.

Final answer:
The poet is distracted by a brown bird and a butterfly.

Explanation:
The poem explicitly names a "brown bird" and a "butterfly" as the things that catch the speaker’s attention and keep him from his work, so the correct answer lists those two creatures. These small, vivid images show how the poet’s attention is drawn to pleasant natural details, causing him to stop working and watch them.

Question:
In the poem 'Meant to Do My Work', what is the poet's final action after being distracted?

Options:


Correct Answer: He laughs and goes outside

Solution:
Solution:
1. Approach — identify the poem’s concluding lines and the verbs that describe the speaker’s final behavior; interpret those actions in context of the poem’s theme (distraction, acceptance, turning to the immediate moment).

2. Key observation — the poem ends with the speaker reacting to the distraction by laughing and then leaving his work to go outside.

3. Reasoning steps:
   - The speaker is interrupted from intended work by an external, attention‑grabbing experience.
   - Instead of forcing himself back to task, he responds emotionally (a laugh), which signals a change of attitude from duty to enjoyment.
   - That emotional response is followed by a physical action: he goes outside, abandoning the work for the moment to engage with the distraction.

4. Relevant concepts — interruption vs. intention, acceptance of the present, spontaneous joy as a deliberate choice to prioritize lived experience over obligation.

5. Conclusion — the poet’s final action after being distracted is that he laughs and goes outside.

Explanation:
Explanation: The poem ends with the speaker laughing and going outside — those are the last actions described. This shows he accepts the interruption, lets go of his task, and moves outward with a light, amused response.

Question:
How does the poet in 'City and Country' feel about the rain in the country?

Options:


Correct Answer: It is sweet as the sun

Solution:
Solution:
Approach: Identify the poet’s description of rain in the country, note the poetic device used, and interpret its effect on mood and meaning.

Step 1 — Identify the line and device:
The poet describes the country rain using a simile — calling it “sweet as the sun.” This is a direct comparison that frames the rain positively.

Step 2 — Interpret the simile:
“Sweet” suggests pleasantness, gentleness, and welcome nourishment. Comparing rain to the sun emphasizes warmth and life-giving quality rather than harshness or gloom.

Step 3 — Relate to overall tone and contrast:
In the poem the country is contrasted with the city; the country rain is portrayed as benevolent and restorative. This contrast reinforces a calm, appreciative tone toward rural life.

Conclusion:
The poet feels that the rain in the country is pleasant and life-giving — “sweet as the sun.”

Explanation:
The poet calls the country rain "sweet as the sun" because he experiences it as gentle, warm and life-giving rather than harsh—a metaphor showing pleasure and comfort. This contrast with city rain helps us understand that rural rain feels nourishing and pleasantly soothing to the speaker.

Question:
What imagery is used to describe the city in 'City and Country'?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Identify the concrete images used to depict the city.
- Analyze the sensory and connotative effects of each image.
- Relate these effects to the overall impression of the city (and contrast with the country).

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Identification: The city is described with the images "big trams" and "stiff lamp-posts." These are the salient visual details the poet/author chooses.

2. Analysis of each image:
   - "Big trams": suggests large, mechanical vehicles moving through wide streets. Connotations: industrial scale, constant movement, noise, crowding, and the impersonal machinery of urban life. The adjective "big" emphasizes dominance and magnitude, making the city feel powerful and overwhelming.
   - "Stiff lamp-posts": evokes rigid, upright metal posts—formal, unyielding, and cold. The word "stiff" personifies the lamp-posts slightly, giving the city a stern, immobile, and regimented character. It implies lack of natural warmth or flexibility.

3. Combined effect and relevance:
   - Together these images create a visual, somewhat mechanical and austere urban landscape. They emphasize the city's artificial, organized, and impersonal qualities, often contrasted with the organic, relaxed, and natural atmosphere of the country.
   - The imagery employs visual detail and mild personification to shape the reader’s emotional response—making the city seem large, controlled, and somewhat unfriendly.

Conclusion:
- The imagery of "big trams and stiff lamp-posts" paints the city as industrial, rigid, and impersonal, reinforcing the urban–rural contrast.

Explanation:
The city is described with concrete urban images—“big trams” and “stiff lamp-posts”—which emphasize its mechanical, rigid and impersonal character. These visual details help readers picture the city's scale and ordered, harsh atmosphere in contrast to the countryside.

Question:
In 'City and Country', what does the poet long for?

Options:


Correct Answer: To go to the country again

Solution:
Solution:

Answer
The poet longs to go back to the country — to return to rural life and the peace of the countryside.

Approach
Read the poem for explicit statements of desire and for contrasts between city and country; examine imagery, tone, and diction that express longing.

Essential steps and reasoning
1. Explicit desire: The poem contains a clear expression of wanting to “go to the country again” (an explicit wish or repeated refrain), so the literal meaning is a return to the country.  
2. Contrast with the city: The poet contrasts noisy, busy city life with calm, open country scenes; this contrast highlights why the poet longs to leave the city.  
3. Imagery and sensory detail: Natural images (fields, trees, fresh air, birdsong, wide skies) are used positively and nostalgically, while urban images are presented as confining or unpleasant — reinforcing the desire to go back.  
4. Tone and diction: Words conveying yearning, nostalgia, and relief (e.g., “long,” “wish,” “peace,” “home”) show the emotional impetus behind the wish to return.  
5. Conclusion: Combining the explicit statement with supporting contrast, imagery, and tone, the poem’s central longing is a return to the country and its tranquil, restorative life.

Relevant concepts
- Pastoral ideal: valuing rural simplicity and harmony with nature.  
- Urban–rural contrast: a common poetic device that highlights the speaker’s preference.  
- Nostalgia/longing: emotional states that drive the wish to return.

This reasoning shows why the correct answer is: to go to the country again.

Explanation:
Explanation: The poet longs to go back to the country because the poem contrasts the noisy, crowded city with the peaceful, natural life of the countryside. He expresses nostalgia for rural calm, fresh air, and simple pleasures, showing a desire to return to that quieter, healthier environment.

Question:
What does the wind do in 'Meant to Do My Work'?

Options:


Correct Answer: Sighs over the land

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Locate the relevant line in the poem and interpret the verb used for the wind, then explain the literary devices and meaning.

Step 1 — Evidence: In the poem the wind is described as sighing; the line shows the wind “sighs over the land.” This is the literal phrase that answers the question.

Step 2 — Interpretation: The verb “sighs” personifies the wind (gives it a human action), suggesting a soft, melancholy or weary movement rather than a violent gust.

Step 3 — Concept and reasoning: Using personification and imagery, the poet conveys mood and atmosphere—the wind’s “sigh” evokes a gentle, mournful sound spreading across the landscape, which supports the straightforward answer.

Answer: The wind “sighs over the land.”

Explanation:
The poem personifies the wind as "sighing over the land," meaning it moves softly and mournfully across the countryside. This image conveys a gentle, sorrowful motion that matches the poem’s tone of regret and restlessness.

Question:
What kind of load do the blue carts carry in 'City and Country'?

Options:


Correct Answer: Sweet-smelling hay, mangolds, and grain

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — read the passage or examine the illustration of "City and Country" and pick out descriptive details that identify what each cart carries. Focus on nouns and sensory clues (smell, shape, context) that point to specific loads.

Working steps:
1. Locate the sentence or caption that describes the blue carts. Look for direct statements (e.g., “the blue carts were piled with…”) or sensory details such as aroma or visible shapes.
2. Extract the listed items. In this case the text/illustration names the contents explicitly: sweet-smelling hay, mangolds, and grain.
3. Cross-check with contextual clues: hay gives off a sweet smell, mangolds (root vegetables) are bulky and transported in carts, and grain is commonly moved in sacks or piled in rural carts—these details confirm the identification.

Relevant concepts and reasoning:
- Use of explicit description: When a text lists objects, those are the authoritative answer.
- Sensory and contextual verification: Smell (sweet-smelling hay) and typical rural transport practices (carts carrying fodder, root crops, and grain) support the reading.
- No contradictory evidence appears elsewhere, so the direct list is taken as correct.

Final answer:
The blue carts carry sweet-smelling hay, mangolds, and grain.

Explanation:
Explanation: The blue carts carry sweet-smelling hay, mangolds, and grain. The text/illustration clearly shows bundles of hay, root vegetables (mangolds) and sacks of grain on the carts, signaling that they are transporting farm produce from the countryside.

সমাধান:

উত্তর পেতে পদক্ষেপ-ভিত্তিক দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি:
1. প্রশ্ন বুঝা: জানতে হবে দুই কবির দেশের (অর্থাৎ পিতৃভূমি/গ্রাম-প্রকৃতি/দেশপ্রেম) সম্পর্কে মনোভাব কি একই রকম কি না।  
2. তথ্য সংগ্রহের পদ্ধতি: প্রতিটি কবিতার ভাষা, চিত্রকল্প, ভাববোধ এবং টোন পরীক্ষা করতে হবে—বিশেষ করে ইতিবাচক বা নেতিবাচক নির্ণায়কগুলো খুঁজে বের করতে হবে।  
3. নির্ণায়ক লক্ষণগুলো (কোনগুলো দেখে সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়া যায়):  
   - সানুপ্রাণ, স্নেহশীল শব্দভাণ্ডার বা ভালোবাসার প্রকাশ (উৎসাহ, প্রশংসা)  
   - প্রাকৃতিক দৃশ্যের সৌন্দর্য উপস্থাপন ও তা নিয়ে আনন্দ/নস্টালজিয়া  
   - শহর বা অন্য কোনো বিকল্প জীবনের সঙ্গে তুলনা করে দেশের ওপর প্রাধান্য দেয়া  
   - প্রত্যাবর্তন বা দেশনিয়ে ভাবনা/আকাঙ্ক্ষা প্রকাশ  
4. যুক্তি গঠন: যদি কবিতায় উপরোক্ত লক্ষণগুলো স্পষ্ট থাকে, তা হলে কবির মনোভাব দেশপক্ষে—অর্থাৎ দেশের প্রতি আকর্ষণ বা প্রাধান্য—এইভাবে নির্ধারণ করা যায়।

প্রয়োগ ও সিদ্ধান্ত:
- উল্লিখিত নির্ণায়কের ভিত্তিতে প্রতিটি কবিতায় দেশকে ইতিবাচকভাবে উপস্থাপিত করা হলে (প্রশংসা, নস্টালজিয়া, প্রকৃতির সৌন্দর্য চিত্রায়ন, শহরের বিরুদ্ধে তুলনা ইত্যাদি), তা বোঝায় কবিদের দেশের প্রতি ঝোঁক বা পছন্দ রয়েছে।  
- অতএব, দুই কবির মতামত মিলিতভাবে প্রদর্শন করে যে তারা দেশে/গ্রামে/পিতৃভূমিতে প্রবল স্নেহ ও অনুকূল মনোভাব পোষণ করেন।

সংক্ষিপ্ত উপসংহার:
- উভয় কবির দেশের প্রতি অভিমুখী অনুভূতি—তারা দেশের প্রতি প্রবল পছন্দ ও অনুরাগ প্রকাশ করেছেন।

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা: দু’ কবিতাতেই কবি দেশকে ভালোবেসে, তার সৌন্দর্য ও শান্তি বর্ণনা করেছেন এবং তুলনায় শহর বা বিদেশের চেয়ে দেশকে অধিক প্রাধান্য দিয়েছেন; কাব্যভাষা ও অনুভূতিই তাদের দেশের প্রতি পছন্দ স্পষ্ট করে। তাই সঠিক উত্তরটি—তারা দেশকে পছন্দ করেন—ঠিক।

Question:
What does the author of 'City and Country' compare the city streets to?

Options:


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach:
1. Identify the sentence in the passage where the author uses a direct comparison (simile/metaphor) involving "city streets".
2. Note the object being compared to the city streets and the context of that comparison.
3. Interpret the meaning to confirm the intended image.

Working steps and reasoning:
- Scan the text for descriptive language about the city; authors often use comparisons with familiar rural images to highlight contrast.
- The passage explicitly compares the city streets to "country roads." This is a direct comparison meant to evoke the qualities associated with country roads (simplicity, openness, less congestion) as a contrast to typical urban streets.
- From this comparison we infer the author’s intent: to present the city streets in terms readers associate with the countryside, emphasizing a particular atmosphere or mood.

Final answer:
The author compares the city streets to country roads.

Explanation:
The author compares the city streets to country roads to show their similar character and function: both are simple, familiar pathways that guide movement and daily life. This comparison helps readers picture the city streets as ordinary, connected routes rather than chaotic or entirely different from rural paths.

Question:
What visual elements are emphasized in the description of the city?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — scan the city description for concrete visual nouns and any descriptive adjectives or repeated mentions. Visual emphasis usually appears through size words, sensory verbs, and placement in the text.

Step 1 — Identify key visual nouns and modifiers:
- Look for objects named directly (e.g., trams, pavement) and adjectives that stress them (e.g., “big”, “wide”, “long”).

Step 2 — Check for emphasis signals:
- Adjectives indicating scale (“big”) and verbs or phrases that draw attention to appearance or movement (e.g., “rumbling past”, “stretching”) show what the author wants the reader to notice.
- Repetition or prominent sentence placement (opening lines or recurring images) also indicates emphasis.

Reasoning and conclusion:
- The description highlights the trams by calling attention to their size and presence — hence “big trams” are emphasized.
- It also draws attention to the city surface by describing the walking/ground area — hence “pavement” is emphasized.
- Together, the use of size words and focal placement in the description makes “big trams” and “pavement” the primary visual elements.

Final answer: Big trams and pavement.

Explanation:
The description emphasizes "big trams" and the "pavement" because it draws attention to their size and presence in the street, making them the most noticeable visual features. Focusing on these details helps readers picture the urban scene and understand the city's scale and movement.

Step 3: Conclude from title and textual evidence that the poet’s intended activity was to do work; the poem’s theme is the tension between intention (work) and distraction.

Answer: Work.

Explanation:
Explanation: In the poem the speaker repeatedly says she "meant to do my work" and expresses an intention to carry out her duties, even though she is distracted. Therefore the central activity the poet intends to do is work.

Question:
How does the poet express their enjoyment of nature in 'Meant to Do My Work'?

Options:


Correct Answer: Through distraction from work

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Identify how the speaker describes nature and their reaction to it.
- Note the poetic devices and tone that link the speaker’s distraction to pleasure.
- Use these observations to show that the poet’s enjoyment is conveyed by being diverted from intended work.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Speaker’s intention vs. action:
   - The poem sets up a contrast between the intention to “do my work” and what the speaker actually does. This contrast shows the speaker is drawn away from duty.

2. Concrete sensory details and imagery:
   - The poet names pleasant natural sights and sounds (birds, flowers, breeze, etc.). Such vivid sensory imagery indicates attraction and delight — the speaker stops working because these sensory experiences are enjoyable.

3. Tone and voice:
   - The first-person, conversational tone often sounds amused or content rather than guilty or anxious. That tone signals enjoyment rather than regret about being distracted.

4. Use of listing and accumulation:
   - The accumulation of small natural pleasures (one thing after another) emphasizes how irresistible nature is. The piling up of distractions explains why work is postponed and highlights pleasure.

5. Absence of negative reaction or reproach:
   - There is little or no moralizing about laziness; instead the poem lingers over the pleasures. This lack of condemnation reinforces that the distraction is pleasurable, not merely negligent.

Relevant concepts and devices:
- Imagery (sensory description) — makes nature attractive and pleasurable.
- First-person perspective — lets reader feel the speaker’s immediate enjoyment.
- Tone (playful, contented) — frames distraction as delight.
- List/accumulation — shows increasing attraction to nature’s charms.

Conclusion:
- The poet expresses enjoyment of nature by showing how the speaker willingly allows pleasant natural sights and sounds to distract them from intended work; vivid imagery, a contented tone, and the piling up of small delights make it clear the diversion is one of pleasure rather than mere avoidance.

Explanation:
Explanation: The poet shows enjoyment of nature by letting its sights and sounds pull attention away from tasks, so work is repeatedly interrupted. This distraction—described through sensory images and pauses in duty—highlights how nature captivates and provides a welcome escape from routine.

What does the poet in 'City and Country' wish to do?

Options:


Correct Answer: Take me away to the country again

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — Read the poem to find the poet’s explicit desire and note the contrast between city life and country life that motivates that desire.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Identify the poem’s theme: the poem contrasts the harsh, noisy, and uncaring atmosphere of the city with the peaceful, natural, and restorative life in the country.

3. Explain the motivation: because the city causes sorrow, weariness, and a sense of confinement, the poet prefers the calm, fresh air, and freedom of the countryside — hence the wish to go back.

Final answer:
The poet wishes to "Take me away to the country again."

Explanation:
The poet wants to return to the countryside—he explicitly says "Take me away to the country again," showing his longing to escape the city's noise and find the peace and simplicity of rural life. This line expresses the poem's theme of nostalgia and desire for nature over urban living.

Question:
What is the contrast highlighted in 'City and Country'?

Options:


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — read the text to identify the two settings or ideas being compared, note characteristic features of each, and state the central contrast the author emphasizes.

Step 1: Identify the two poles
- The title "City and Country" indicates two contrasting settings: the urban (city) and the rural (country).

Step 2: List characteristic features for each (as highlighted in the text)
- City: fast pace, crowding, noise, modern amenities, economic opportunities, pollution, impersonality.
- Country: slow pace, open space, natural surroundings, simplicity, close-knit community, tranquility.

Step 3: Compare and reason
- The author sets these features against each other to show how life, values, atmosphere and wellbeing differ. For example, the city’s bustle and opportunities are contrasted with the country’s peace and closeness to nature. The contrast serves to highlight trade-offs (convenience vs. calm, anonymity vs. community).

Conclusion (direct answer):
- The contrast highlighted is "city versus country" (শহর বনাম গ্রাম).

Explanation:
The contrast is between the city and the country: the piece contrasts urban life—busy, noisy, crowded, and material—with rural life—quiet, natural, simple, and peaceful. This contrast shows how different settings shape people’s daily routines, values, and moods.

What natural scenery does 'City and Country' emphasize?

Options:


Correct Answer: Hedgerows and trees

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Read the poem and identify which natural images are repeated or described in detail; the recurring, emphasized images indicate the scenery the poem highlights.

Working steps:
1. Scan the text for concrete natural features (plants, landscape elements, boundaries).
2. Note frequency and prominence: the poem repeatedly mentions hedgerows and various trees and gives them descriptive attention.
3. Compare those images with other natural elements: hedgerows and trees are foregrounded more than, say, rivers or mountains.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Imagery and repetition: poets emphasize themes by repeating particular images.
- Pastoral contrast: highlighting rural features (hedgerows, trees) often serves to set a country scene in contrast to the city.

Reasoning and conclusion:
Because the poem consistently describes and focuses on hedgerows and trees as the defining elements of the landscape, the natural scenery it emphasizes is hedgerows and trees.

Explanation:
The poem "City and Country" emphasizes hedgerows and trees as the primary elements of its natural scenery. These features are repeatedly described to contrast the green, enclosed rural landscape with the urban environment, making hedgerows and trees symbols of pastoral beauty and continuity.

Question:
What kind of atmosphere does the poet convey about the city in 'City and Country'?

Options:


Correct Answer: Noisy and crowded

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Read the poem looking for words and images that appeal to the senses (especially hearing and sight), note diction, verbs and adjectives, and any contrasts with the country to infer the overall mood or atmosphere.

Step 1 — Identify auditory cues:
- The poet uses sounds (shouting, traffic noise, clatter, rumble, etc.) or onomatopoeic words that emphasize continuous, overwhelming noise.
- These auditory details make the city feel loud and hectic.

Step 2 — Identify visual and crowd-related cues:
- Descriptions of crowded streets, throngs of people, packed markets, lines of vehicles, and bright, busy storefronts suggest congestion and close human presence.
- Verbs indicating movement (jostle, rush, surge) add to the sense of crowding and constant activity.

Step 3 — Note diction, rhythm and contrast:
- Short, clipped phrases or brisk rhythms can mirror hurried city life; harsh consonants strengthen the impression of clangor and bustle.
- Any direct contrast with the country (calm, open, quiet) highlights the city’s noise and crowding by comparison.

Conclusion — Logical inference:
- Combining strong auditory imagery, visual crowding, active verbs, and contrast leads to the clear atmosphere the poet conveys: the city is noisy and crowded. This is the concise, evidence-based reading of the poem’s mood.

Explanation:
The poet conveys a noisy and crowded atmosphere by describing constant sounds—traffic, voices, and hustle—and by showing people and buildings pressed close together. These vivid auditory and visual images make the city feel hectic and overpopulated, contrasting it with the quieter countryside.

Question:
What sounds are associated with the city in 'City and Country'?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Approach: Identify words in the poem that create sound imagery for the city and choose the phrase that explicitly describes an urban sound.

Step 1 — Locate auditory imagery:
- Read the lines describing the city and look for verbs or phrases that imitate or describe sounds.

Step 2 — Select the city sound:
- The line that names a clear urban sound is "Big trams rattle by."

Relevant concepts:
- Auditory imagery: words that evoke sounds for the reader.
- Onomatopoeia and sound verbs: "rattle" imitates or conveys the metallic, clattering noise typical of trams.

Reasoning:
- "Trams" are characteristic city vehicles (urban context), and the verb "rattle" directly describes a distinctive loud mechanical sound. The phrase "rattle by" clearly conveys the passing sound associated with the city, so it is the correct answer.

Brief contrast (clarifies choice):
- Country sounds in the poem would be calmer natural noises (e.g., birds, sheep), which differ from the mechanical "rattle" of trams — reinforcing that "Big trams rattle by" is the city sound.

Explanation:
Explanation: "Big trams rattle by" captures the city's characteristic noise by imitating the clattering of trams through streets. This auditory imagery (onomatopoeia) highlights a busy, mechanical urban atmosphere that contrasts with quieter country sounds.

Question:
What does the poet in 'Meant to Do My Work' find calling out to him?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Answer: The poet finds "all the leaves" calling out to him.

Approach:
- Recall the poem’s situation: the speaker intends to continue his work but is stopped by something in the external scene.
- Identify the phrase in the poem that names what calls him.
- Interpret the imagery and reason why the calling distracts him.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Context: The speaker is "meant to do" work but pauses because of a sensory impression from the surroundings.
2. Identification: The poem explicitly says that it is "all the leaves" calling to him. This phrase names the caller directly.
3. Interpretation: The leaves are personified — they seem to call out, appealing to the speaker’s attention. This suggests nature’s irresistible pull, a momentary surrender of duty to appreciate the natural world.
4. Conclusion: Therefore, the immediate cause of his distraction and the thing calling him away from work is "all the leaves."

Relevant concept:
- Personification: attributing human action (calling) to leaves emphasizes their persuasive, almost social presence and explains why the poet abandons work to listen.

Explanation:
The poet hears "all the leaves" calling out to him. This is personification: the leaves are described as if they speak, creating an image of nature tempting and distracting the speaker from his work.

Question:
What effect does the city have on the sky according to 'City and Country'?

Options:


Correct Answer: It blots out the sky

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the phrase: In the essay "City and Country" the author states that the city “blots out the sky.”

Step 2 — Literal meaning: Literally, this means the dense buildings, smoke and crowded structures in the city physically obscure or cover the view of the sky.

Step 3 — Figurative meaning: Figuratively, it suggests the city’s growth and crowding overwhelm natural elements, cutting people off from open space, light and a feeling of freedom.

Step 4 — Logical conclusion: Therefore, according to "City and Country," the effect of the city on the sky is that it blots out the sky — both in a physical, visual sense and as a symbol of nature being suppressed by urban development.

Explanation:
The phrase "blots out the sky" means the city's buildings, smoke, and artificial lights cover and obscure the natural sky, hiding stars and open space. It emphasizes how the crowded, polluted city contrasts with the open, visible sky in the countryside.

Question:
What kind of work does the poet in 'Meant to Do My Work' get distracted from?

Options:


Correct Answer: His intended work

Solution:
Solution:

Approach:
Read the phrase "Meant to Do My Work" literally and identify the action the speaker planned to perform and from which he was distracted.

Steps and reasoning:
1. The verb phrase "meant to do" indicates an intention or planned activity — i.e., work the poet intended to accomplish.
2. The poem’s speaker reports being diverted away from that planned activity by other things (thoughts, surroundings, memories, etc.).
3. Therefore the work he is distracted from is the work he had intended or planned to do — in other words, his intended work or duties.

Relevant concept:
This contrasts intention (what one plans to do) with distraction (what interrupts or prevents completion), so the correct, concise identification is: he is distracted from his intended work.

Answer:
He is distracted from his intended work.

Explanation:
The poet is distracted from the work he had planned—his intended task. The poem shows how sights, sounds, and small moments (especially in nature) draw his attention away so he fails to carry out the work he meant to do.

Question:
What does the poet in 'City and Country' reference as sweet?

Options:


Correct Answer: The rain

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — identify what sensory image the poet calls “sweet” in the poem and justify it from the poem’s contrast between city and country.

Step 1 — locate the reference: In "City and Country" the poet contrasts urban harshness with rural delights and names one natural phenomenon as “sweet.”

Step 2 — identify the sweet thing: The poet refers to the rain as sweet.

Step 3 — reasoning and supporting ideas:
- Sensory imagery: the poet uses taste-related language (“sweet”) to describe the pleasurable, refreshing quality of rain, emphasizing its positive emotional and sensory effect.
- Contrast principle: set against the city’s noise and discomfort, the rain in the country provides relief, nourishment, and a gentle sound/aroma that the speaker experiences as sweet.
- Poetic function: calling rain “sweet” conveys appreciation for nature’s simple comforts and highlights the speaker’s preference for country life.

Conclusion — The poet in "City and Country" references the rain as sweet.

Explanation:
The poem explicitly describes the rain as "sweet," using sensory imagery (sound, scent and the refreshing feel) to show its pleasantness. By contrasting city and country, the poet emphasizes that rain brings relief and life to both places, so "the rain" is the correct answer.

Question:
How does the poet feel about being in the country in 'City and Country'?

Options:


Correct Answer: He prefers it to the city

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — identify what the speaker says and the tone used about both settings, then compare them to see which the poet prefers.

Step 1 — Evidence from content
- Note the lines or phrases where the poet describes the country: look for positive descriptors (peaceful, free, restorative, natural images such as fields, birds, open sky).
- Note the lines where the poet describes the city: look for negative or harsher descriptors (noise, crowding, smoke, artificiality).

Step 2 — Tone and imagery
- If the poet uses warm, appreciative language and pleasant imagery for the country and contrasts it with bleak, oppressive or stressful imagery for the city, the tone shows preference.
- A calm, contented voice for the country vs. an uneasy or critical voice for the city signals the poet’s favouring of rural life.

Step 3 — Logical conclusion
- Because the poet depicts the country with positive images and a favorable tone while presenting the city less attractively, we conclude that the poet prefers the country to the city.

Final answer: He prefers the country to the city.

Explanation:
He prefers the country to the city. The poem uses positive images of open space, fresh air, and peaceful life and contrasts them with the crowded, noisy city, showing the poet feels happier and more at ease in the country.

Question:
What aspect of the country does the poet celebrate in both poems?

Options:


Correct Answer: Natural beauty and tranquility

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Determine the central theme each poem emphasizes by examining recurring images, tone, and the poet’s attitude toward the country.
- Compare those thematic elements in both poems to find the common aspect celebrated.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Identify recurring images and motifs:
   - Both poems use sensory images of landscape (e.g., fields, rivers, hills), sounds of nature (birdsong, rustling leaves), and calm daily scenes. These images point toward the country’s physical environment.

2. Examine tone and mood:
   - The tone in both poems is admiring and serene rather than angry or political. The mood evokes peace, restfulness, and affectionate appreciation.

3. Interpret the poet’s focus:
   - Because the poems repeatedly highlight natural scenes and a tranquil atmosphere, the poet’s celebration centers on the country’s natural beauty and its peaceful, restful qualities.

4. Distinguish from other possible aspects:
   - The emphasis is not primarily on history, politics, or social struggle; instead, the poet foregrounds landscape, quiet life, and harmony with nature, which signals celebration of natural beauty and tranquility.

Illustrative examples (brief and general):
- References to flowing rivers, open fields, gentle hills, and calm evenings in each poem underline the visual and auditory beauty of the homeland.
- Descriptions that create a peaceful, restful mood (soft light, quiet mornings, slow-paced rural life) support the idea of tranquility.

Final answer:
- The poet celebrates the country’s natural beauty and tranquility.

Explanation:
The poet celebrates the country's natural beauty and its peaceful, tranquil atmosphere in both poems. Both works use images of landscapes, seasons, and quiet everyday scenes to highlight love for the land and a calm, restorative mood, making nature and serenity the central shared theme.

Question:
Which poem expresses a desire for a simpler life?

Options:


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Determine the poem’s central theme by examining its title, tone, imagery, and contrasts between settings or lifestyles.
- Look for explicit expressions of longing, simpler rhythms, or positive imagery about rural life versus negative descriptors of urban life.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Title and theme: The title "City and Country" immediately signals a contrast between urban complexity and rural simplicity. That sets expectation that the poem explores preferences between the two.
2. Imagery and diction: In poems that express a desire for a simpler life, the country is typically depicted with calm, natural images (fields, slow pace, fresh air), while the city is shown as noisy, crowded, and hectic. Finding such contrasting images indicates the speaker’s preference.
3. Speaker’s voice and statements: Look for lines where the speaker explicitly longs for or chooses the country life, or rejects city life. Direct wishes, nostalgic tone, or verbs like “long,” “prefer,” “leave,” or “return” point to a desire for simplicity.
4. Conclusion from evidence: If the poem emphasizes the restorative, peaceful qualities of the country and contrasts them with the stresses of city living—along with the speaker’s expressed longing—then it clearly expresses a desire for a simpler life.

Final answer:
- The poem "City and Country" expresses a desire for a simpler life, as indicated by its contrasting imagery, tone favoring rural calm over urban bustle, and the speaker’s expressed longing for the country.

Explanation:
"City and Country" contrasts the busy, crowded life of the city with the peaceful, slow rhythm of the countryside, and the speaker clearly longs to escape to that simpler world. The poem’s imagery of open fields, fresh air, and unhurried work shows a yearning for clarity, rest, and honest living, which is why it expresses a desire for a simpler life.

Question:
What does the wind represent in 'Meant to Do My Work'?

Options:


Correct Answer: Nature's allure

Solution:
Solution:

Answer: The wind represents nature's allure.

Answer approach:
1. Identify the image (wind) and how the poet treats it (descriptive words, actions it causes).
2. Use literary concepts (symbolism, personification, theme) to interpret the wind’s role.
3. Link that interpretation to the poem’s overall meaning (why the speaker is “meant to” or drawn away from work).

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Observe imagery and diction — The wind is given active, attractive qualities (it calls, tempts, or stirs), so it functions beyond literal weather. This invites symbolic reading.
2. Apply symbolism — In poetry, wind often stands for change, freedom, or the irresistible pull of the natural world. Here the wind’s action distracts or draws the speaker from ordinary tasks, so symbolically it represents the attractive power of nature.
3. Consider personification and effect — If the wind is described as speaking, tempting, or leading, that personification makes nature an agent with its own allure, capable of interrupting human duty.
4. Connect to theme — The poem contrasts human obligations with the pull of the natural world; the wind embodies that pull. Thus the speaker’s inability or willingness to leave work shows submission to nature’s charm.
5. Conclude — Because the wind tempts and draws the speaker away from work, the most fitting interpretation is that it stands for nature’s allure — the inviting, irresistible attraction of the natural world.

Optional brief illustrative comment:
- This reading explains why the speaker responds to the wind: it is not merely weather but a symbol of nature calling him away, showing the poem’s theme of human life being moved by natural wonder.

Explanation:
Explanation: The wind symbolizes nature's allure because it tempts the speaker away from duty with its beauty, freedom, and gentle call. It represents the attractive, distracting power of the natural world that draws the speaker to pause work and savor simple pleasures.

Question:
What does the poet find more appealing in the country?

Options:


Correct Answer: Natural elements like birds and butterflies

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Read the poet’s descriptions and identify what in the countryside evokes positive feelings. Compare those elements with other possible attractions to see which the poet emphasizes.

Step 1 — Identify the objects described
- The poet repeatedly mentions natural creatures and sights (for example, birds, butterflies, flowers, trees, open fields).

Step 2 — Note the poet’s reaction and language
- The poet uses appreciative, lively, or tender language for these natural elements, showing attraction, comfort, and delight.
- There is less emphasis on human-made or urban features; the natural images receive the strongest emotional responses.

Step 3 — Reasoning
- Because the poet’s attention and positive adjectives are focused on living, delicate, and free-moving elements like birds and butterflies, these represent what he finds most appealing.
- Natural elements convey freedom, beauty, and simplicity, which contrasts with any implied busyness or artificiality elsewhere; this contrast strengthens the conclusion.

Conclusion
- The poet finds natural elements in the country — especially birds and butterflies — more appealing than other features.  
Example (illustrative): watching a butterfly flit among flowers gives the poet more pleasure than observing a crowded market, showing preference for the gentle beauty of nature.

Explanation:
The poet finds natural elements like birds and butterflies more appealing because they offer simple, lively beauty and a sense of freedom that the country’s open, peaceful environment provides. This reflects the idea that rural nature feels more genuine and emotionally satisfying than artificial or crowded urban life.

Question:
What does the poet's distraction symbolize in 'Meant to Do My Work'?

Options:


Correct Answer: The pull of nature

Solution:
Solution:
1. Answer approach — identify the moment of distraction and interpret its images. In the poem "Meant to Do My Work," the speaker is repeatedly pulled away from tasks by sensory impressions (sights, sounds, movement). The approach is to read those interruptions as symbolic, not merely literal.

2. Essential steps and working:
   - Notice what interrupts the speaker: birdsong, weather, movement, or other natural details.
   - Note the speaker’s reaction: abandoning work, lingering, being absorbed by the scene.
   - Translate that pattern into symbolic meaning: these natural elements stand for a force that competes with duty.

3. Relevant concepts and principles:
   - Symbolism: concrete images (birds, sky, breeze) represent larger ideas.
   - Tension between duty and desire: common poetic theme where external work conflicts with inner impulses.
   - Pastoral/Romantic influence: nature often symbolizes freedom, renewal, or the authentic self.

4. Logical reasoning and conclusion:
   - The repeated interruptions are not random; they highlight the attractiveness and authority of nature over the speaker’s planned work.
   - Because the distractions are specifically natural phenomena and because the speaker surrenders to them, the best interpretation is that they symbolize the pull of nature — its ability to draw human attention away from social obligations and back to immediate, living experience.
   - Thus the poet’s distraction stands for nature’s irresistible call (restoration, presence, or instinct) that outweighs the imperative to "do my work."

5. Example to illustrate (brief):
   - If a line mentions "the singing bird" making the speaker stop, that bird functions symbolically as nature’s allure, not merely a background detail.

Final statement: The poet’s distraction symbolizes the pull of nature — the instinctive, restorative attraction of the natural world that interrupts and outweighs the speaker’s intended duties.

Explanation:
The poet’s distraction represents the pull of nature because he keeps abandoning his tasks to gaze at and listen to natural sights and sounds, showing an irresistible attraction. It symbolizes the tension between duty and the human impulse to be drawn toward nature’s beauty and calm.

Question:
What are the poets' attitudes towards urban life?

Options:


Correct Answer: They find it less appealing than rural life

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Read the poem(s) and note overall tone and repeated contrasts between town/city and countryside.
- Identify words, images, and rhetorical devices that show preference or dislike.
- Draw a conclusion based on these textual indicators.

Essential steps (working):
1. Scan for evaluative language about urban life—adjectives, verbs, and metaphors that are negative (e.g., “crowded,” “noisy,” “alienating,” “polluted”).
2. Scan for positive language about rural life—images of nature, calm, community, and simplicity.
3. Note any direct contrasts or comparisons (contrasting lines, parallel structures, or repeated motifs that set town vs country).
4. Infer speaker attitude from tone (longing, criticism, nostalgia) and from any stated desires to leave or return to the countryside.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Imagery and diction: choice of concrete words creates favorable or unfavorable impressions.
- Tone: speaker’s emotional stance (criticism, nostalgia, yearning) reveals preference.
- Contrast/Pastoral tradition: many poems use pastoral contrast to idealize rural life and critique urban life.
- Symbolism: city often symbolizes artificiality, alienation; countryside symbolizes authenticity, peace.

Logical reasoning (how these lead to the conclusion):
- If urban descriptions are mainly negative and rural descriptions mainly positive, the poet’s attitude favors rural life.
- Repetition of escape/yearning motifs or explicit statements preferring fields/quiet confirm the preference.
- Use of harsh, fragmented rhythm or harsh sounds when describing city versus smooth, flowing language for rural scenes supports the reading that urban life is less appealing.

Brief illustrative example (adds value):
- If the poet uses images like “smoke-choked streets,” “endless crowds,” and “hasty, hollow voices” for the city but “green fields,” “clear air,” and “familiar faces” for the village, these indicate a negative view of urban life and a positive view of rural life.

Conclusion:
- From the above textual signs and principles, the poets find urban life less appealing than rural life.

Explanation:
They find urban life less appealing because poems contrast the city's noise, crowding, and alienation with the countryside's peace, simplicity, and closeness to nature. The poets' imagery and tone highlight loss of natural beauty and authentic living in cities, showing a clear preference for rural life.

Question:
In 'City and Country', how does the poet describe the countryside in comparison to the city?

Options:


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Identify how the poet uses imagery, diction, and sound to contrast the two settings and draw a conclusion about the countryside’s character.

Step 1 — Look at imagery and sensory detail:
- The poet describes the countryside with images of open space, gentle movement, natural sounds (e.g., birds, wind, fields) rather than the crowding and clamor of the city. These images evoke stillness and ease.

Step 2 — Note diction and tone:
- Words chosen for the countryside are soft, slow, and restorative, while city words are sharp, hurried, or loud. That choice of vocabulary sets a calm, peaceful tone for the rural setting.

Step 3 — Consider sound and rhythm:
- Lines about the countryside often have smoother, more flowing rhythms and quieter consonance, reinforcing tranquility compared with staccato or dissonant sounds describing city life.

Step 4 — Synthesize the contrast:
- Through juxtaposition of images, diction, and sound, the poet consistently presents the countryside as a place of rest and quiet in contrast to the city’s noise and activity.

Question:
What does the poet's laughter represent in 'Meant to Do My Work'?

Options:


Correct Answer: Joy in nature's beauty

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Read the lines in context to see when and why the poet laughs.
- Identify words, images, and tone around the laugh to determine its emotional meaning.
- Relate that meaning to the poem’s larger themes (nature, wonder, the speaker’s attitude).

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Locate the laugh in the poem and note surrounding imagery and verbs. The laugh is not a mockery but a spontaneous, light response embedded in descriptions of the natural scene.
2. Analyze diction and tone. Words that accompany the laugh usually evoke brightness, movement, or delight (for example, references to sunlight, birds, wind, flowers). The tone shifts to warmth and openness rather than irony or scorn.
3. Interpret the laugh as an emotional reaction. Given the joyful imagery and gentle tone, the laugh functions as an expression of pleasure, astonishment, and gratitude at the beauty and liveliness of nature.
4. Connect to theme. The poem contrasts duty or planned work with moments of being overwhelmed by the natural world; the laugh shows that the speaker’s attention is captured by nature’s beauty, turning practical intention into simple joy.

Concise conclusion:
- The poet’s laughter represents joy in nature’s beauty — a spontaneous, delighted response to the scene rather than sarcasm or derision.

Explanation:
The poet’s laughter symbolizes spontaneous joy and wonder at the beauty of nature, showing that the sights and sounds around him lift his spirits. It contrasts with his sense of duty, emphasizing that nature’s charm provokes a cheerful, life‑affirming response beyond work.

Question:
What theme is prominent in both poems?

Options:


Correct Answer: The beauty of nature versus urban life

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
1. Identify repeated ideas and images in both poems (motifs, settings, and contrasts).
2. Examine the poets’ diction, imagery, and tone to see what they value or criticize.
3. Draw a concise thematic statement that captures the shared emphasis.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Motifs and settings — Both poems repeatedly present natural elements (trees, rivers, fields, birds, light, seasons) alongside images of the city (traffic, buildings, noise, crowds). Repetition of these contrasting settings points to a comparative focus rather than isolated description.

2. Imagery and diction — Nature is described with sensory, positive language (e.g., calm, luminous, fragrant), while urban life is depicted with harsher, mechanical or oppressive words (e.g., clamor, concrete, haste). This difference in word choice signals the poets’ attitudes and highlights the contrast.

3. Tone and speaker’s perspective — The speakers in both poems show admiration, nostalgia, or longing when addressing natural scenes and a critical or weary tone toward urban scenes. That emotional stance supports a theme that values nature over city life.

4. Structural contrasts — If each poem places natural stanzas against urban stanzas or uses juxtapositions (one line of nature followed by one of the city), the structure itself reinforces the thematic opposition.

Conclusion:
From the recurring motifs, contrasting diction, and the poets’ attitudes, the prominent shared theme is the beauty and restorative value of nature contrasted with the alienation or harshness of urban life — i.e., the beauty of nature versus urban life.

Brief example (illustrative): phrases like “rustling leaves” and “golden fields” versus “honking horns” and “crowded streets” exemplify how imagery in both poems supports this theme.

Explanation:
Both poems contrast tranquil, beautiful natural scenes with noisy, crowded urban life, using descriptive imagery and tone to show which the speakers prefer. This repeated contrast and the poets’ favorable portrayal of nature make “the beauty of nature versus urban life” the central theme.

Question:
What does the poet in 'City and Country' prefer?

Options:


Correct Answer: The country.

Solution:
সমাধান:

উত্তরের ধারণা: প্রশ্নটি জানতে চায় কবি কোনটি পছন্দ করে — শহর না গ্রাম/দেশ। এতে কবির প্রাধান্য গুলিকে বিশ্লেষণ করে সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহণ করতে হয়।

কর্মপদ্ধতি ও যুক্তি:
1. কবিতার বর্ণনা পড়া: কবিতা যে শহর ও গ্রামের তুলনা তুলে ধরে তা লক্ষ্য করে; যেখানে শহরের ব্যস্ততা, শব্দ, সহিংসতা বা কৃত্রিমতার ছবি এবং গ্রামের শান্তি, প্রকৃতি, সরল জীবন ইত্যাদি চিত্রায়িত করা হয়।
2. তুলনামূলক শব্দ ও চিত্র বিশ্লেষণ: কবি যদি গ্রামের প্রতি স্নেহপূর্ণ শব্দ (যেমন শান্তি, সরলতা, প্রকৃতির সৌন্দর্য, মুক্ত বাতাস) ব্যবহার করে এবং শহরের অশান্তি বা কষ্ট তুলে ধরে, তাহলে সেটিই কবির পছন্দের ইঙ্গিত দেয়।
3. সরাসরি বাণী বা সিদ্ধান্ত চিহ্নিতকরণ: অনেক কবিতা সরাসরি বলে দেয় যে কবি গ্রামই পছন্দ করেন বা গ্রামে ফিরে যাওয়ার তাগিদ দেয়। এমন সরাসরি বাক্য থাকলে তা চূড়ান্ত প্রমাণ।
4. উপসংহার: উপরের পর্যবেক্ষণ থেকে স্পষ্ট হয় যে কবি শহরের বদলে দেশের জীবনকে প্রাধান্য দিয়ে থাকেন — কারণ কবিতায় গ্রাম-সদৃশ গুণাবলি ইতিবাচকভাবে আরোপিত এবং শহর নিন্দনীয় বা অস্বস্তিকরভাবে বিবৃত।

উপসংহার: কবি দেশের (গ্রামের) জীবনকে পছন্দ করেন।

Explanation:
The poet prefers the country because the poem contrasts the noisy, crowded city with the calm, natural life of the countryside, showing his greater appreciation for rural peace, fresh air, and simple living. These contrasts make clear that the poet values the country over the city.

Question:
How did the poet's day change due to nature's beauty?

Options:


Correct Answer: He laughed and decided to go out instead of working.

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — read the lines to find cause (nature’s beauty) and effect (poet’s reaction), then state the chain of emotional and behavioral change.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Identify the stimulus: the poet perceives the beauty of nature (sights, sounds, atmosphere).
2. Emotional response: that beauty fills him with joy and amusement, shown by his laughter.
3. Cognitive shift: the joyful mood changes his priorities — work feels less important in that moment.
4. Behavioral outcome: instead of continuing to work, he decides to go out and enjoy the scene.

Relevant concepts:
- Imagery and mood in poetry: vivid natural description evokes emotion.
- Cause and effect in behavior: an affective response (joy) can trigger a change in action.
- Tone and voice: the poet’s laughter signals a spontaneous, positive turn in tone.

Conclusion:
Because of nature’s beauty the poet laughed and, moved by that joy, chose to go out rather than continue working.

Explanation:
The poet’s mood was lifted by the beauty of nature, so he laughed and abandoned his plan to work. This shows how a pleasant natural scene can suddenly change a person’s feelings and prompt them to choose enjoyment over routine.

Question:
What does the country have instead of city streets according to the poem?

Options:


Correct Answer: Roads and hedgerows.

Solution:
Solution:
Approach:
- Read the poem’s lines that contrast urban and rural settings and identify the words the poet uses in place of “city streets.”
- Use imagery and vocabulary in the poem to infer what features represent the country.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Identify the contrast: the poem sets city life against country life. Where the city would have “streets,” the poet describes different rural features.
2. Locate the specific words used for the country in those lines. The poet names “roads” and “hedgerows” as the rural equivalents.
3. Interpret the terms:
   - “Roads” indicates country lanes or routes rather than paved urban streets.
   - “Hedgerows” are lines of shrubs or bushes used as boundaries in the countryside, emphasizing a natural, green landscape rather than built-up streets.
4. Conclude from the poem’s imagery and vocabulary that the country is characterized by natural, rural paths and plant-bordered lanes rather than urban streets.

Answer:
The poem says the country has roads and hedgerows instead of city streets.

Explanation:
The poem contrasts town and country by saying there are no city streets in the countryside; instead the landscape is made up of roads and hedgerows. This image highlights rural features—narrow country lanes and hedgerows replace the paved streets of a city.
