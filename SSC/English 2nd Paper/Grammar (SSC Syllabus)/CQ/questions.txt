Question:
Make six sentences using the parts of sentences from each column of the table below:

$\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}\hline \text { (a) Wildlife } & \text { (i) is } & \text { (i) on wildlife. } \\\hline \text { (b) Balance of ecosystem largely } & \text { (ii) refers } & \text { (ii) harmful to wildlife. } \\\hline \text { (c) Any development } & \text { (iii) depends } & \begin{array}{l}\text { (iii) to all animals, plants } \\\text { found in the forests. }\end{array} \\\hline \begin{array}{l}\text { (d) Urbanization and } \\\text { industrialization }\end{array} & \text { (iv) should take } & \text { (iv) be extinct. } \\\hline \text { (e) As a result, many animals } & \text { (v) have also increased } & \begin{array}{l}\text { (v) united efforts to protect } \\\text { wildlife. }\end{array} \\\hline \text { (f) For our own existence, we } & \text { (vi) are going to } & \begin{array}{l}\text { (vi) deforestation to a great } \\\text { extent. }\end{array} \\\hline\end{array}$

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Matching:

(a+ii+iii) = Wildlife refers to all animals, plants found in the forests. (বন্যপ্রাণী বলতে বনে পাওয়া সমস্ত প্রাণী, উদ্ভিদকে বোঝায়।)

(b+iii+i) = Balance of ecosystem largely depends on wildlife. (বাস্তুতন্ত্রের ভারসাম্য অনেকাংশে বন্যপ্রাণীর উপর নির্ভর করে।)

(c+i+ii) = Any development is harmful to wildlife. (যেকোনো উন্নয়ন বন্যপ্রাণীর জন্য ক্ষতিকর।)

(d+v+vi) = Urbanization and industrialization have also increased deforestation to a great extent. (নগরায়ণ এবং শিল্পায়নও বন উজাড়কে ব্যাপক মাত্রায় বাড়িয়ে দিয়েছে।)

(e+vi+iv) = As a result, many animals are going to be extinct. (ফলস্বরূপ, অনেক প্রাণী বিলুপ্ত হতে চলেছে।)

(f+iv+v) = For our own existence, we should take united efforts to protect wildlife. (আমাদের নিজেদের অস্তিত্বের জন্য, বন্যপ্রাণী রক্ষার জন্য আমাদের সম্মিলিত প্রচেষ্টা নেওয়া উচিত।)

Explanation:
Explanation: Each sentence is made by combining a subject from the left column, an appropriate verb from the middle column, and a complement from the right column so that both grammar and meaning fit (subject–verb agreement and correct verb collocation). For example, "Wildlife refers to all animals, plants found in the forests" uses "refers to" to define the subject; "Balance of ecosystem largely depends on wildlife" uses "depends on" with "on wildlife"; and "Urbanization and industrialization have also increased deforestation to a great extent" uses a plural subject with "have also increased" taking "deforestation…" as its object. This matching ensures each sentence is grammatically correct and semantically logical.

Solution:
(a) The newspaper is unquestionably one of the most valuable sources of knowledge.

(c) Does it mirror the entire world like a reflection?

(d) Reading the newspaper daily is unavoidable. Daily news is contained within.

(f) It actively aids us in numerous ways.

(h) People fondly refer to it as the people's parliament.

(i) There is nothing more important than it.

(j) We should read the newspaper to gain a better understanding of the outside world.

Explanation:
(a) Newspaper is a useful source of knowledge.
Explanation: Changed the superlative “one of the most useful” to the positive degree by using “a useful” to state a general quality.

(b) It does not carry only local news; it also carries international news.
Explanation: Made the sentence negative by adding “does not” and clarified the contrast with “also” to keep the original meaning.

(c) Does it reflect the whole world like a mirror?
Explanation: Turned the statement into a yes/no question by using the auxiliary “does” and inverting subject and verb.

(d) We read the newspaper daily.
Explanation: Removed the negative structure “cannot help” and used a simple affirmative present tense to express the habitual action.

(e) Daily news is contained in it.
Explanation: Formed the passive by making the object “daily news” the subject and using the passive verb “is contained.”

(f) It helps us in many ways.
Explanation: Converted the passive “are helped in many ways by it” to active with “it” as subject and “helps” as the verb.

(g) We cannot enrich our knowledge by reading the newspaper.
Explanation: Made the sentence negative by changing “can” to “cannot,” which negates the possibility expressed originally.

(h) People call it the people's parliament.
Explanation: Changed the passive “is called” to an active form with the agent “People” and the verb “call.”

(i) It is more important than anything.
Explanation: Converted the original “Nothing is so important as it” into a comparative form using “more... than.”

(j) Read the newspaper to know the outside world better.
Explanation: Turned the sentence into an imperative by using the base verb “Read,” implying the subject “you,” and used “better” for clearer comparative meaning.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) the; (b) on the; (c) x; (d) with; (e) the; (f) a; (g) an; (h) x; (i) a; (j) an.

Explanation: Use a "the" in (a) because "one of the most" requires the definite article with a superlative, and in (e) because specific hills of the town are meant. Use "on the" in (b) for location with "western bank," and "with" in (d) to show accompaniment. Use "a"/"an" for single countable nouns ((f), (i), (g), (j)) choosing "an" before a vowel sound; omit the article (x) after a possessive ("its" in (c)) and after a quantifier ("several" in (h)).

Solution:
Gap filling with articles or prepositions:

(a) the; (b) x; (c) x; (d) for; (e) the; (f) the; (g) of; (h) in; (i) to; (j) at.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) the, (b) one's, (c) — (no word), (d) for, (e) the, (f) the, (g) of, (h) in, (i) to, (j) at.

Explanation: Use "the" for specific nouns ("the best time", "the maxim", "the seeds") and "one's" to show possession of "life"; no article is needed before "most important" because it's a predicate adjective. "For" introduces the logical subject ("for one to remember"), "of" shows what the seeds consist of, "in this season" gives the time/place of sowing, "to reap" indicates purpose, and "at this time" denotes when something takes root.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) to, (b) at, (c) for, (d) an, (e) the, (f) the, (g) on, (h) his, (i) a, (j) an.

Explanation: Use the fixed prepositional collocations—“obedient to,” “at the age,” “go for studies,” “put … on the ship,” “crossing the Atlantic,” “struggle a lot,” and the possessive “his mother.” Article rules: use [math]an[/math] before a vowel sound (“an excellent,” “an education”), use [math]the[/math] for a definite/specified noun already identified (“the preparations,” “the Atlantic”), and use [math]a[/math] for a nonspecific quantity (“a lot”).

Gap filling with articles or prepositions:

'(a) an; (b) from; (c) in; (d) for; (e) x; (f) among; (g) for; (h) to; (i) x; (j) of.

Explanation:
(a) "an" — because we need the singular form "an infectious disease" and "infectious" begins with a vowel sound.  
(b) "around" — "around the world" is the common preposition meaning everywhere in the world.  
(c) "in" — "in many countries" shows where the economic crisis exists.  
(d) "for" — "a great disaster for the people" indicates who is affected.  
(e) "x" (no article) — no article is used before the adjective "deadly" in the predicate "is very deadly."  
(f) "among" — "awareness among mass people" (better: "among the masses") shows awareness within a group.  
(g) "from" — "learnt many things from it" shows the source of learning.  
(h) "to" — "indifferent to some rules" is the correct idiom.  
(i) "x" (no article) — no article is needed when talking generally about "massive gatherings" in plural.  
(j) "of" — the phrase is "a habit of washing hands," so "of" links habit and action.

Solution:
Gap filling with articles or prepositions:

(a) of; (b) a; (c) with; (d) the; (e) a; (f) a; (g) with; (h) in; (i) on; (j) an.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) of, (b) a, (c) — (no word), (d) be a, (e) a, (f) a, (g) in, (h) in, (i) on, (j) an.

Use 'of' after "types"; use 'a' or 'an' with singular countable nouns (e.g., "a dream," "a future plan," "a must," "an aim"); (c) needs no article or preposition because "meet it" is complete. Use 'in' for being within a field or showing interest ("in the working field," "interest in action"), and 'on' for dependence ("depends on a real dream"); 'to be a' is the correct infinitive phrase in (d).

(a) the; (b) x; (c) x; (d) for; (e) the; (f) the; (g) of; (h) in; (i) to; (j).at.

Explanation:
Explanation: a "the" is required because "best" is a superlative and takes the definite article; b is a cross (x) because "life" is used in a general sense and needs no article.  
c is x (no word) because "most important" works as the predicate adjective; d "for" introduces who should act ("one"); e "the" specifies that particular maxim.  
f "the" and g "of" form the phrase "the seeds of …"; h "in" indicates the season (time) when they are sown and i "to" shows purpose ("to reap"); j "during" correctly denotes the period when something takes root.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) and (b): use adjectives to describe the country, so "riverine" and "agricultural" are correct.  
(c): a noun is needed, so "importance." (d): an adjective, "dependent." (e): the sentence means lack of enough water, so "insufficient."  
(f): adjective "different." (g): present tense verb for rivers, "dries." (h): adverb modifying "poisonous," so "extremely." (i): negative adjective "unsuitable." (j): noun "betterment."

Each choice matches the required part of speech in context (nouns like "relaxation/smoothness/idleness/freshness", adjectives like "charmless/beautiful/monotonous/harmful", the verb "renews", and the compound noun "overwork"). These are standard derivations (suffixes like -less, -ous, -ness, -ful, and the verb form -s) that make the sentence grammatically correct and meaningful.

Use adjective forms when describing people or attitudes and noun forms when naming states or things, and apply common prefixes/suffixes (in-, -ous, -ion, -ment, -less) to make the meanings fit the sentence.

Question:
In ancient time, textbook was the most (a) — (resource) thing for the students. Teachers were the only guides and source of information. The students had to collect all the (b) — (inform) from the lecture of their (c) — (teach). There was no guidebook or other (d) — (refer) books in the market. During that period a teacher had to deliver a lecture by (e) — (study) the textbook. Because of the (f) — (situate) the students used to depend on the teachers (g) — (complete). As a result, there was a great (h) — (relate) between a (i) — (teach) and a student. Their (j) — (popular) existed among the students in the society.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "resourceful" — we need an adjective from "resource" to describe the textbook as rich in resources/information.  
(b) "information" — the noun form of "inform" fits "collect all the ___."  
(c) "teacher" — the noun form of "teach" names the person giving the lecture.  
(d) "reference" — used before "books," the noun/adjective "reference" denotes books for consultation.  
(e) "studying" — the gerund form fits after "by" to show how the teacher prepared the lecture.  
(f) "situation" — the noun form of "situate" refers to the context or condition causing dependence.  
(g) "completely" — the adverb form of "complete" modifies "depend" to show extent.  
(h) "relationship" — a noun from "relate" that expresses the connection between teacher and student.  
(i) "teacher" — again the correct noun form of "teach" for the person.  
(j) "popularity" — the noun form of "popular" shows how well liked they were among students.

So, they got a (j) — (respect) position in the society.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Use the correct noun/adjective forms: "utilization" is the noun after "proper", "valuable" describes time, "idleness" fits after "in", and "Punctuality" is the noun name of the virtue. Choose forms that match grammar and agreement: "enriches" agrees with the singular subject "Punctuality", "human" is the adjective for "life", "biographies" is the correct plural, and "undone" is the past-participle used as an adjective. Finally, "Obviously" is the adverb modifying the clause and "respectable" is the adjective describing "position", making the whole sentence grammatically and meaningfully correct.

People are (a) — (general) fond of glittering things. They are the (b) — (love) of the surface. They are concerned with the (c) — (out) show of things and beings. They (d) — (hard) bother about intrinsic value. Gold is a very (e) — (value) thing. But there are (f) —(vary) metals in nature that look like gold. They fade soon and become less (g) — (beauty). So the surface of anything should not be the key for its (h) — (measure). We all should be (i) — (care) about this truth. Otherwise, we will have to be (j) — (repent) in the long run.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) generally; (b) lovers; (c) outward/outer; (d) hardly; (e) valuable; (f) various; (g) beautiful; (h) measurement; (i) careful; (j) repentant.

Question:
Early rising is the habit of (a) — (get) up from bed early in the morning. An early (b) — (rise) can enjoy the (c) — (fresh) of the morning air. He can hear the (d) — (melody) songs of the birds. Again, he can start his day’s work (e) — (early) than others. An early riser does not suffer from (f) — (physic) problems very often. So, he need not go to any (g) — (physic) (h) — (frequent). Thus, an early riser enjoys (i) — (vary) benefits and leads a (j) — (peace) life.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) getting; (b) riser; (c) freshness; (d) melodious; (e) earlier; (f) physical; (g) physician; (h) frequently; (i) various; (j) peaceful.

Explanation:
Explanation: After "habit of" we use a gerund, so (a) is "getting"; a person who rises is a noun, so (b) "riser"; quality/state nouns use "-ness", so (c) "freshness"; songs need an adjective, so (d) "melodious". For comparison use the comparative "earlier" for (e); health uses the adjective "physical" for (f); one visits a doctor (noun) so (g) "physician" and the action needs an adverb "frequently" for (h). For (i) we use the adjective "various" to describe "benefits", and for (j) the adjective "peaceful" describes "life".

Flowers are the symbol of love and (a) — (pure). They are (b) — (know) for their beauty and fragrance. Some flowers are (c) — (note) for their fragrance and same are for their beauty. But the rose is favourite to us for its colour and beauty. Its mother place is the city of Paris. The (d) — (japan) are exceptionally famous for its (e) — (cultivate). At present most of the countries grow rose in plenty. It (f) — (general) grows from June to November. Its scent makes us (g) — (cheer). It makes people lively, lovely, (h) — (affection) and so on. By (i) — (grow) roses in plenty, we can export them and solve our (j) — (employ) problem.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) purity (b) known; (c) noted/notable; (d) Japanese; (e) cultivation; (f) generally; (g) cheerful; (h) affectionate; (i) growing: (j) unemployment.

Explanation:
(a) purity, (b) known, (c) noted, (d) Japanese, (e) cultivation, (f) generally, (g) cheerful, (h) affectionate, (i) growing, (j) employment.  
These forms are chosen because abstract qualities need nouns (purity, cultivation, employment), past participles act as adjectives (known, noted), nationality uses the adjective/noun "Japanese", manner needs an adverb (generally), emotions need adjectives (cheerful, affectionate), and after "By" we use a gerund (growing).

(d) — (monotony) work hinders the (e) — (smooth) of work. Leisure (f) — (rich) our sprit to work. Everybody knows that (g) — (work) is (h) — (harm). Leisure does not mean (i) — (idle).

Explanation:
Answers: a relaxation; b charmless; c beautiful; d monotonous; e smoothness; f enriches; g overwork; h harmful; i idleness; final verb: create.

Why these are correct: choose the part of speech that fits the sentence—nouns (e.g., [math]relaxation[/math], [math]idleness[/math], [math]overwork[/math], [math]smoothness[/math]) where a thing/state is needed, adjectives (e.g., [math]charmless[/math], [math]beautiful[/math], [math]monotonous[/math], [math]harmful[/math]) to describe, and verbs (e.g., [math]enriches[/math], [math]create[/math]) for actions.

(d) "greedy" and (f) "dishonest" are adjectives (one from "greed", one the opposite of "honest"), and (e) "wickedness" is the noun form of "wicked."

Explanation:
Explanation:
Correct words: (a) useful, (b) impossible, (c) natural, (d) strengthens, (e) indiscriminately, (f) imbalance, (g) planting, (h) happier, (i) healthier, (j) peaceful.

Use these because adjectives like "useful", "natural" and "peaceful" modify nouns; "impossible" uses the negative prefix im- to mean not possible; "strengthens" is the correct third-person singular verb form for "It"; "indiscriminately" is an adverb (‑ly) describing how we cut; "imbalance" is the noun meaning lack of balance; "planting" is the noun/gerund used in the collocation "tree planting programme"; and "happier" and "healthier" are comparative adjectives that pair with "better" to describe life.

Use the correct word forms: adverbs modify verbs so (a) "seriously" (hampered), (d) "honestly" and (e) "frugally" (use electricity), and (i) the verb "upgrade" (improve power stations). Adjectives describe nouns so (c) "industrial", (g) "national", and (h) "effective" are needed, while noun forms express states or problems so (b) "difficulties" and (f) "awareness" fit best.

(a) illiterate; (b) ignorant; (c) cultivation; (d) gambling; (e) famine; (f) impossible; (g) poverty/ poorness; (h) scientific; (i) available; (j) irrigation.

Explanation:
Explanation: ক needs the adjective "illiterate" (negative of "literate") and খ is "ignorant" because both describe the farmers; গ is the noun "cultivation" which follows "methods of".  
ঘ is the phrase "a gamble", ঙ should be "famine" (the correct noun) and চ is "impossible" (negative adjective formed with "im-"); ছ is the noun "poverty".

Explanation:
Choose the form that fits the grammar: noun where a thing is needed, adjective/adverb where something is described, and verb where an action is meant. For example, (a) "education" is a noun (the aim of something), (b) "useful" is an adjective after "be", (c) "truly" is an adverb modifying "educated", (d) "personal", (e) "thoughtful", (f) "truthful", (g) "dutiful" and (h) "prosperous" are adjectives describing nouns, (i) "remove" is the verb meaning "take away", and (j) "self-reliance" is a noun.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) naturally; (b) curiosity; (c) happening; (d) supplier; (e) powerful; (f) notifications; (g) companion; (h) growth; (i) unmixed; (j) smaller.

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) by nature — "by nature" is the correct adverbial phrase that modifies "is curious" and means "by instinct."  
(b) curiosity — a noun is needed as the object of "satisfy," so "curiosity" fits.  
(c) happening — the present participle shows ongoing events: "what is happening around the world."  
(d) source — "source" (origin) is the natural collocation: "the source of all sorts of news and views."  
(e) powerful — an adjective is needed to describe "instrument," so "powerful instrument" is correct.  
(f) notifications — the plural noun "notifications" names the official announcements given by the government.  
(g) companion — "companion" (not "company") means something that keeps you company in solitary hours.  
(h) growth — the noun "growth" correctly completes "helps the growth of public opinion."  
(i) unmixed — the idiom "not an unmixed blessing" means it is not wholly good, so "unmixed" is required.  
(j) smaller — the comparative "smaller" correctly expresses that newspapers have made the world more connected.

Question:
Smoking produces (a)----- (danger) ------ effects on man. By smoking a man incurs both physical and (b)------ (economy) loss. Smoking is a kind of (c)------ (addict) ------. Those who become (d)------ (addict)------ to drug, first begin smoking which is the initial step of addiction. We should raise (e)---- (aware)------ among our people. We should (f)------ (courage)------ others to smoke. It is (g)------ (possible)----- to stop smoking without (h)------ (unite) ---------- efforts. (i)------ (fortunate)----- only the (j)------ (wise)------ men can do such foolish work.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) dangerous; (b) economic: (c) addiction; (d) addicted; (e) awareness; (f) discourage; (g) impossible; (h) united; (i) Unfortunately; (j) unwise.

Explanation:
(a) dangerous — "effects" needs an adjective, so "dangerous" describes harmful effects.  
(b) economic — "loss" takes the adjective "economic" (not "economical").  
(c) addiction — "a kind of" requires a noun, so the noun "addiction" fits.  
(d) addicted — after "become" we use the past participle "addicted" (to drugs).  
(e) awareness — we "raise awareness" (noun) among people.  
(f) discourage — to stop others we "discourage" them (verb formed with dis-).  
(g) impossible — the opposite of "possible" is needed: "It is impossible to stop..."  
(h) united — "efforts" is modified by the adjective "united."  
(i) unfortunately — a sentence adverb is required, so "unfortunately" fits.  
(j) unwise — those who do foolish things are "unwise" (adjective).

Question:
(a)---(write) are put on sale in the book fair. Most of the (b) — (visit) buy books of different (c) — (publish). Almost no visitor returns from the fair without making any purchase. The (d) — (buy) like to buy at a fair price. Our book fair is always (e) — (crowd). As (f) — (vary) books are (g) — (play) in a fair, the buyers get a scope to choose books. They buy their (h) — (choose) books after a long search. This faculty is (i) — (available) in any place other than a book fair. A book fair is always (j) — (come) to the students.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) writers; (b) visitors; (c) publishers; (d) buyers; (e) crowded: (f) various; (g) displayed: (h) chosen; (i) unavailable; welcoming.

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) "writings" — From "write", the noun "writings" means written works, which fits as the subject being sold.  
(b) "visitors" — "Visitor" is the noun form of "visit"; most people who come to a fair are called visitors.  
(c) "publications" — From "publish", "publications" refers to different printed works (books, magazines), so it fits here.  
(d) "buyers" — "Buyer" is the noun form of "buy"; it correctly names the people who purchase items.  
(e) "crowded" — "Crowded" is the adjective describing a place full of people, so it suits "Our book fair is always ...".  
(f) "various" — "Various" (from "vary") is an adjective meaning different kinds of, matching "books".  
(g) "displayed" — From "display" (contains "play"), "displayed" describes how books are shown at the fair.  
(h) "chosen" — "Chosen" is the past participle of "choose" used as an adjective for the books buyers select.  
(i) "unavailable" — "Unavailable" (not available) correctly states that this facility cannot be found elsewhere.  
(j) "welcome" — From "come" the word "welcome" fits idiomatically: the fair is a welcome event (a benefit) to students.

Question:
Bangladesh is an (a) — dependent country, but she is still burdened with poverty, (b) — population, (c) — employ, corruption, food (d) — deficient, natural calamities, power crisis etc. Considering all these. the present (e) — govern has aimed at making a digital Bangladesh to (f) — come most of these problems. The actual aim of (g) — digit Bangladesh is to establish technology based government which will emphasize the overall (h) — develop of the country and the nation. The country has (i) — ready fixed its target of (j) — achieve ‘Digital Bangladesh’ by 2021.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) independent; (b) overpopulation; (c) unemployment; (d) deficiency: (e) government; (f) overcome; (g) digital; (h) development; (i) already;(j) achieving/ achievement.

Explanation:
The blanks require correct parts of speech: an adjective for the country's status ('developing'), nouns to name problems ('overpopulation', 'unemployment', 'deficiency'), a noun for authority ('government'), a verb to express solving ('overcome'), an adjective for the programme ('Digital'), a noun for progress ('development'), an adverb to modify 'fixed' ('already'), and a gerund after 'target of' ('achieving').  
So the natural choices are: (a) developing; (b) overpopulation; (c) unemployment; (d) deficiency; (e) government; (f) overcome; (g) Digital; (h) development; (i) already; (j) achieving — each fits both grammatically and semantically in the sentence.

Question:
Money cannot buy (a) — (happy). Money is a must for our life. But it is not necessary to bring happiness. Happiness is (b) — (absolute) a (c) — (psychology) thing. It is the name of a (d) — (feel). It means the (e) — (content) of the mind. He who has (f) — (satisfy) with what he has is (g) — (real) a happy one. Above all, we should keep in mind that (h) — (world) happiness is not all. If we want to be (i) — (eternal) happy and lead a (j) — (dignify) life, we have to earn money in an honest way.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) happiness: (b) absolutely; (c) psychological; (d) fecling; (e) contentment; (f) satisfaction; (g) really; (h) worldly: (i) eternally; (j) dignified.

Explanation:
Happiness cannot be bought — (a) "happiness" is the noun naming the thing. The sentence needs proper word forms: (b) "absolutely" (an adverb) to modify "is", (c) "psychological" (an adjective) to describe "thing", (d) "feeling" and (e) "contentment" are nouns for inner states, (f) "satisfied" is the adjectival past participle, (g) "really" is an adverb modifying "is", (h) "worldly" and (j) "dignified" are adjectives describing nouns, and (i) "eternally" is an adverb showing duration; in short, choose nouns for objects/states, adjectives to describe nouns, and adverbs/participles to modify verbs or show condition.

Question:
Honesty is opposite to (a) — (honest). An honest man is not (b) — (harm) to anybody. He never does (c) — (just) to others. When he does anything (d) — (moral), he feels (e) — (comfortable). He never tells a lie. He is always (f) — (response) to his duty. We should follow the path of (g) — (honest) and leave the path of (h) — (honesty). In that case, you will be (i) — (love) by all and will be able to reach the path of (j) — (prosper).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) dishonesty; (b) harmful; (c) injustice; (d) immoral; (e) uncomfortable; (f) responsible; (g) honesty; (h) dishonesty; (i) loved; (f) prosperity.

Explanation:
Use common prefixes and suffixes to form correct opposites and grammatical forms: "dis-" makes the opposite so (a) and (h) are "dishonesty"; "in-"/ "im-" make negatives so (c) = "injustice" and (d) = "immoral", while "un-" makes (e) = "uncomfortable"; "-ful" makes (b) = "harmful".  
(f) is "responsible" meaning dutiful, (g) is the noun "honesty" from "honest", (i) is the past participle "loved", and (j) is the noun "prosperity" from "prosper".  
These examples show how prefixes (dis-, in-, im-, un-) and suffixes (-ful, -ity, -ed) change word meaning and form.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক এখানে ক্রিয়াপদ "buy"‑এর উদ্দেশ্যে নাম (object) লাগবে; "happy" বিশেষণ, তাই নামবাচক রূপ "happiness" ব্যবহৃত হবে।  
খ "necessary" একটি বিশেষণ, এটিকে বর্ণনা করার জন্য ক্রিয়া বা বিশেষণের ওপর কাজ করে এমন ক্রিয়াবিশেষণ (adverb) লাগবে — তাই "obviously" সঠিক।  
গ "brings"‑কে বা পুরো ভাবকে নির্দেশ করার জন্য adverb প্রয়োজন; "necessarily" এই কাজে উপযুক্ত।  
ঘ এখানে বলা হচ্ছে সুখ মূলত মানসিক বিষয়, তাই তা বর্ণনা করতে "primarily" (অর্থাৎ প্রধানত/মূলত) ব্যবহার করা হয়।  
ঙ "the name of a ..." পর নেওয়ার জন্য名詞 প্রয়োজন; অনুভূতির অর্থে "feeling" সঠিক নামবাচক শব্দ।  
চ "content of mind" বলতে মনের সন্তুষ্টি বোঝাতে নামবাচক রূপ "contentment" প্রয়োজন।  
ছ "mental ..." বলতে মানসিক সন্তুষ্টির কথা, তাই ক্রিয়ার পরিবর্তে নাম "satisfaction" সঠিক।  
জ "a lot of ..." এর পরে বস্তুবাচক শবদ চাই; "rich" বিশেষণ, তাই বস্তুবাচক "riches" অর্থাৎ ধন-সম্পদ ব্যবহার হবে।  
ঝ "the cause of ..." পর সাধারণত নাম লাগে এবং "happy"‑এর বিপরীত বোঝাতে "unhappiness" যথাযথ।  
ঞ "suffer from" এর পরে ক্রিয়া নয় বরং নাম/ক্রিয়ানাম (gerund) লাগে; ফলে "suffering" ব্যবহার করা হয়।

Explanation:
Facebook is a social networking (network) site. It has gained much popularity (popular) among the young generation (generate). Sometimes, our young generation waste their valuable (value) time by browsing (browse) Facebook. So, in this respect parental supervision (supervise) is a must. Many people define (fine) Facebook as an embarrassing (embarrass) invasion (invade) of others' personal (person) privacy. However, it plays a significant (signify) role in socialization (socialize) as well as natural (nature) understanding and cooperation (operation).

Explanation:
I changed word forms by adding appropriate prefixes/suffixes so each word fits the sentence grammatically (e.g., verbs to nouns: "popularity", "invasion"; verb to gerund: "browsing"; noun to adjective: "personal", "natural"). Prefixes like "de-" and "co-" create correct meanings ("define", "cooperation"), and adjectival endings like "-ing" or "-able" make words modify nouns properly ("networking", "valuable").

Explanation:
Explanation: Use the correct word-forms (adjective, noun or adverb) made by adding suitable prefixes/suffixes to fit the grammar and meaning. For example, "riverine" and "agricultural" are adjectives describing the country, and "majority" is the noun meaning most people. Negative ideas use the prefix "un-" or "dis-" as in "unfortunately," "unsatisfactory," and "disadvantages"; adverbs take "-ly" (e.g., "hardly," "properly," "gradually"). Other common suffixes produce adjectives or nouns: "financial," "technological," "government" (from govern + -ment), "conventional," and "effective," which all match the roles required in the sentences.

Explanation:
Explanation: The blanks are filled by changing the root words into the grammatical form required by the sentence using common suffixes and prefixes: use [-er] to form agent nouns (teach → teachers), [-ion]/[-ation] to make abstract nouns (inform → information; devote → devotion), [-ful]/[-ive] to make adjectives (resource → resourceful; inform → informative), and [-ship], [-ity], [-ence]/[-ance] to make friendship, popularity, dependence respectively. Use the negative prefix im- with an adjective-forming suffix to negate a root when needed (measure → immeasurable). Choosing these forms makes the sentence grammatically correct because each blank requires either a noun, adjective, or agent noun that matches the surrounding words.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Adding suffix, prefix or both:

(a) enrich; (b) accurately; (c) unknown; (d) contextual; (e) specific; (f) clearly; (g) various; (h) continuous (i) proficiency; (j) continuity; (k) sincerity; (1) interaction; (m) different; (n) international.

Explanation:
The blanks are filled by adding common prefixes/suffixes: en- + rich = enrich; accurate + -ly = accurately; un- + known = unknown; context + -ual = contextual; specify + -ic = specific; vary + -ed = varied; clear can remain “clear” in “clear situations.” Other forms: continue + -ous = continuous; proficient → proficiency; continue → continuity; sincere → sincerity; interact → interaction; differ → different; nation → national. These follow basic word‑formation rules: prefixes (en-, un-) change meaning, and suffixes (-ly, -al, -ic, -ed, -ous, -ency/-ity/-ion) change word class so each word fits grammatically and semantically in the sentence.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:
ক "coldest" — 'cold' থেকে সর্বোচ্চ বিভিন্নতা (superlative) করতে '-est' যোগ করে 'coldest' হয়, কারণ বাক্যে তুলনা করা হচ্ছে।  
খ "rainless" — 'rain' + '-less' মানে 'বৃষ্টি নেই/অপচিকিত', তাই শীত সাধারণত বৃষ্টিহীন বলতে 'rainless' ব্যবহৃত হয়।  
গ "coldness" — 'cold' থেকে abstract noun বানাতে '-ness' যোগ করে 'coldness' হয়, যা শীতের তীব্রতা বোঝায়।  
ঘ "equally" — 'equal' এর adverb হলো 'equally', কারণ 'felt' ক্রিয়াটিকে কিভাবে অনুভূত হয়েছে তা বর্ণনা করতে adverb লাগে।  
ঙ "especially" — 'special' থেকে adverb 'especially' হয়, যা নির্দিষ্টভাবে কোথায় তা নির্দেশ করে।  
চ "northern" — দিকবাচক adjective 'north' → 'northern' ব্যবহার করে উত্তর জেলা বোঝানো হয়।  
ছ "biting" — 'bite' থেকে present participle/ adjective 'biting' দিয়ে 'biting cold' নামক idiom অনুযায়ী তীক্ষ্ণ শীত বোঝায়।  
জ "gloomy" — 'gloom' থেকে adjective করতে '-y' যোগ করে 'gloomy' হয়, যা প্রকৃতির বিষণ্ণ অবস্থা দেখায়।  
ঝ "covered" — 'cover' এর past participle 'covered' ব্যবহার করে অবস্থা (remains covered with fog) বোঝানো হয়।  
ট "greatly" — 'great' থেকে adverb 'greatly' হয়ে 'suffer' ক্রিয়াকে পরিমাপ করে (ভেবে বড় কষ্ট ভোগ করা)।  
(উক্ত বাক্যে) "warm woollen clothes" — শীত প্রতিরোধে 'woollen' ধাতু-শব্দ যোগ করে উষ্ণ কাপড় নির্দেশ করা হয়।  
ঠ "hilly" — 'hill' থেকে adjective 'hilly' করে পাহাড়ি অঞ্চলের বর্ণনা করা হয়।  
ড "severity" — 'severe' থেকে abstract noun 'severity' হয়, যা শীতের তীব্রতার মাত্রা প্রকাশ করে।  
ঢ "whereas" — 'where' থেকে 'whereas' একটি বিরোধসূচক conjunction, বিপরীত অবস্থা দেখাতে লাগে।  
ণ "southern" — 'south' → 'southern' করে দক্ষিণাঞ্চল adjectivally চিহ্নিত করা হয়।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

Explanation:
Most blanks are filled by adding suffixes or prefixes to make the root word the correct part of speech: adjectives use endings like -ous/-ious (study → studious) or -ful (mindful, helpful, dutiful, respectful, truthful), -ive (creative); adverbs use -ly (polite → politely); nouns use -ity/-ness (punctual → punctuality, sincere → sincerity, honest → honesty); the negative prefix in- makes inattentive; and -ing or -er give verbal/adjectival forms (thinking, riser). Choose the form that fits the sentence grammar (adjective before a noun, adverb after “behaves,” noun after “benefit of,” negative with in- when expressing “not”).

Solution:
(a) smoking; (b) dangerous; (c) harmful; (d) costly; (e) smoker; (f) publicly; (g) pollution; (h) innumerable; (i) respiratory; (j) unaware.

Explanation:
Use 'smoking' (a gerund) because we need the noun for the habit; 'dangerous' (b), 'harmful' (c) and 'costly' (d) are the adjective forms that correctly describe the habit and its effects. 'Smoker' (e) names the person who smokes, 'in public' (f) is the proper prepositional phrase, 'pollution' (g) is the noun from 'pollute', and 'numerous' (h) is the correct adjective meaning many. 'Respiratory' (i) is the adjective relating to breathing, and 'unaware' (j) correctly shows people who do not know the bad effects.

Explanation:
Leisure and relaxation are both nouns, so (a) relaxation fits; life described as lacking appeal is "charmless" and the things of nature are "beautiful," so (b) charmless and (c) beautiful. Repetition needs adjectives/nouns: (d) monotonous (adj) work hinders the (e) smoothness (noun) of work. 

(f) "Leisure enriches" uses the correct verb form; (g) overwork is the single-word noun for excessive work and (h) harmful is the adjective from harm; (i) idleness (noun) means being idle; and (j) recreate (verb) means to renew or restore our energy.

Explanation:
(a) Use "perseverance" because a noun is needed (the quality required). (b) "successful" is the adjective describing the state of a person.  
Those who do not persevere become (c) "unsuccessful" (the opposite adjective) and blame their (d) "misfortune" (a noun meaning bad luck).  
"Persevering" (present participle/adjective) people always succeed; (f) "sincerity" is a noun naming the virtue which (g) "enables" (verb) a person to do a job.  
(h) "fruitfully" is an adverb modifying "accomplish," (i) "formative" is the correct adjective for a developmental period, and (j) "misuse" is the verb meaning to use wrongly.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
ক "writers" — কারণ এখানে 'books of famous ...' মানে বহু লেখকের বই, তাই ক্রিয়া 'write' থেকে নামবাচক বহুবচন 'writers' ব্যবহার করতে হবে।  
খ "visitors" — এখানে যারা মেলা দেখে তাদের উদ্দেশ্য, সেক্ষেত্রে 'visit' থেকে নামবাচক বহুবচন 'visitors' সঠিক।  
গ "publications" — 'publish' থেকে উৎপন্ন নামবাচক 'publication(s)' হলো বিক্রয়ের জন্য থাকা বিভিন্ন প্রকাশনা, অতএব 'publications' মানানসই।  
ঘ "buyers" — এখানে যারা কেনে তাদের বোঝাতে 'buy' থেকে নামবাচক 'buyers' (বহুবচন) ব্যবহার করা হয়।  
ঙ "crowded" — মেলার বর্ণনায় এটি একটি অবস্থা, তাই ক্রিয়ার অতীত অংশ 'crowded' অব্যয় (adjective) হিসেবে ব্যবহার করে।  
চ "various" — 'vary' থেকে গঠিত বিশেষণ 'various' ব্যবহার করলে অনেক ধরন/বিবিধ বই বোঝানো যায়।  
ছ "displayed" — এখানে বইগুলো প্রদর্শিত হওয়ার কথা বলছে, তাই passive participle 'displayed' (প্রদর্শিত) সঠিক।  
জ "chosen" — 'choose' এর অতীতভাগ 'chosen' ব্যবহার করে বোঝানো হচ্ছে দীর্ঘ অনুসন্ধানের পরে নির্বাচিত বই।  
ঝ "unavailable" — বাক্য অনুযায়ী এই সুবিধা অন্য কোথাও নেই, তাই 'available' এর নেগেটিভ রূপ 'unavailable' দরকার।  
ঞ "welcome" — 'come' থেকে গঠিত 'welcome' এখানে বিশেষণ হিসেবে ব্যবহৃত হবে: মেলা শিক্ষার্থীর কাছে সবসময় स्वागतযোগ্য/গৃহীত।

Explanation: Choose the adjective form (e.g., [math]famous[/math], [math]natural[/math], [math]artificial[/math], [math]successful[/math], [math]multidimensional[/math]) when describing a noun, and the noun form when the sentence needs a thing or quality (e.g., [math]wisdom[/math], [math]imagination[/math], [math]association[/math], [math]reputation[/math]). For (c) “extraordinary” fits because it intensifies “knowledge,” showing it is beyond ordinary.

Explanation: Use [math]depends[/math] for subject–verb agreement with the singular noun "prosperity"; "lead a lazy life", "build up" and "work hard" are correct collocations; "It should be noted" is a common passive phrase; "waste the days away" is the correct verb phrase and the result clause takes "will fall behind"; finally, "remains" (habitual) and "reaches" (present simple result) fit the sentence, and "follow" means to emulate those nations.

(a) observe; (b) make; (c) waste; (d) fall; (e) are; (f) know; (g) do; (h) utilize; (i) is; (j) follow.

Explanation:
Explanation: Use the base form after a modal like "should", so (a) "imitate", (h) "use" and (l) "follow". Use the simple present for habitual/general truths: (b) "make" (good use), (c) "waste" and (d) "fall". For states use the verb "be" → (e) "are"; after "can" use the base verb → (g) "do"; and since "punctuality" is singular, (i) is "is".

Solution:
Right form of verbs:

(a) originate; (b) are; (c) killing; (d) do not have; (e) seen; (f) making; (g) throw; (h) living; (i) worked; (j) ensured.

Explanation:
Explanation: (a) uses the simple present "flow" because rivers generally do this as a fact; (b) needs the verb "are" to show state; (c) is present continuous "are polluting" to show an ongoing harmful action. (d) "have no" expresses lack of facilities; (e) and (f) are parallel actions so present participles "releasing" and "making" (or "polluting") show ongoing processes; (g) uses simple present "throw" for a habitual action. (h) requires the adjective "alive" to describe the state of fishes; (i) uses the past form "came" after "it is high time" to express urgency (subjunctive sense); (j) needs a past participle like "created" (or "ensured") in passive to show the environment cannot be brought into existence.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Right form of verbs:

(a) is caused; (b) named; (c) causes; (d) die; (e) go; (f) are needed; (g) get; (h) should make; (i) be destroyed; (j) keeping.

Explanation:
We use the passive "is caused" in (a) because dengue results from mosquito bites, and "called" in (b) names the mosquito; (c) takes "is a" to state a general fact. The simple present "die" (d) and "fall" (e) form a zero‑conditional showing a general cause–effect. "Are needed" (f) agrees with the plural idea "much care and proper treatment," while "in order to" requires the infinitive "keep" (g) and habitual action uses simple present "keep" (h). "Should be destroyed" (i) uses passive to show a recommended action, and "with a view to" requires the gerund "keeping" (j).

(a) appears; (b) lives; (c) has been living; (d) did not visit; (e) hears/has heard; (f) Hearing; (g) to pay; (h) should visit; (i) Thinking; (j) calls;

Explanation:
(a) uses the present continuous "is appearing" because the exam is happening this year (an ongoing action); (b) uses simple present "lives" for a permanent fact; (c) uses present perfect "has lived" with "since his birth" to show an action continuing up to now.  
(d) is negative present perfect "has not visited" with "yet" to say the experience hasn’t happened; (e) is present perfect "has heard" for experience/information received.  
(f) is a linking phrase like "Because of this" and (g) takes the infinitive "to pay" after "eager" ("eager to pay a visit").  
(h) uses a modal like "should visit" (expressing his decision/plan) and (i)/(j) ("On this" / "calls") show the immediate result — he becomes excited and calls his friends.

Solution:
Right form of verbs:

(a) possess; (b) claim; (c) brings; (d) is; (e) lost; (f) spent; (g) paid; (h) neglected; (i) lost; (j) neglected.

Explanation:
Most answers are chosen for meaning, collocation and tense/agreement: "hold" collocates with "mentality"; "believe/think" is the reporting verb for an opinion; "brings" agrees with the singular subject "possession"; "is" is the correct copula; "have sacrificed" shows past action affecting the present so "sacrificed" fits; "spend" follows as a habitual/resulting action; "paid" matches the idiom "paid high prices"; "lost" fits the consequence for friends/family; "missed" collocates with "opportunities"; and "lost" (peace) correctly expresses the lack of inner calm. Focus on collocations (common verb + noun pairs), subject‑verb agreement, and tense consistency to choose the right verb forms.

Right form of verbs:

(a) cannot; (b) stumbles; (c) have; (d) find; (e) are; (f) fix; (g) endowed; (h) do not possess; (i) consult; (j) evaluate.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) cannot, (b) drifts, (c) have, (d) find, (e) are, (f) choose, (g) endowed, (h) do not have, (i) consult, (j) judge. 

Use "cannot" to show inability; third-person singular verbs take -s ("drifts"); "should" is followed by the base form ("have"); "find it difficult" is the correct collocation; "there are" expresses plural existence. "Choose" matches the meaning of selecting an aim, "endowed with" correctly describes possessed abilities, "do not have" negates possession for all, and students "consult" teachers who can "judge" their abilities.

Solution:
Right form of verbs:

(a) refers; (b) reflects; (c) has; (d) obeying; (e) was; (f) respect; (g) hampered; (h) ensuring; (i) required; (j) expect.

Explanation:
Social value (a) "relates to" is correct because we use "relate/pertain to" to show connection with customs, beliefs, practices and norms. "Reflects" for (b) is right since social values show or mirror a nation's culture, and "has" for (c) shows possession of educative value. In the rest: "maintaining" (d) follows "conscious of" (a gerund is needed), "was" (e) agrees with the singular "each and every person", "pay (due) respect" (f) is the fixed expression, "hampered" (g) is the past-participle/adjective meaning affected, "maintain" (h) expresses purpose, "needed" (i) shows necessity, and "lead" (j) is the verb used with "life" (we "lead a life").

Question:
once my mother said to me who came to you my friend rafiq mom she asked what did he want i said his mother is ill he needs some money i have given him five hundred taka my mother said wonderful

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Once my mother said to me, "Who came to you?" "My friend, Rafiq, Mom." She asked, "What did he want?" I said, "His mother is ill. He needs some money. I have given him five hundred taka." My mother said, "Wonderful!"

Explanation:
This passage is converted into reported speech, so verbs shift back (present → past, past → past perfect where needed), pronouns are adjusted, and quotation marks are removed. Thus "his mother is ill; he needs some money; I have given him five hundred taka" becomes "his mother was ill; he needed some money; I had given him five hundred taka," and "my mother said wonderful" becomes "my mother said it was wonderful."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Why are you going to Barishal?" said father. "I want to buy some important books," said Sa'ad. "Do you need money?" Yes, father." "Don't go alone as time is not going well."

Explanation:
The correct version uses quotation marks around each speaker’s words and the right end punctuation: questions get question marks inside the quotes ("Why are you going to Borsal?"), statements get commas before the reporting verb ("I want to buy some important books," said Saad). Capitalize the first word of the quoted sentence, but common nouns like "father" stay lowercase unless used as a name. Placing reporting verbs (said/asked) after the quoted speech makes who is speaking clear.

Solution:
"Is there anybody here who has ever crossed a river by a boat?" "I have, teacher. I clearly remember what happened in that journey," said Jamal.

Explanation:
The correct form replaces the wrong words and fixes punctuation and capitalization: "Is there anybody here who has ever crossed a river by boat?" "I have, teacher; I clearly remember what happened in that journey," said Jarnal.  
Use [math]ever[/math] with the present perfect to ask about past experience, always capitalize the pronoun [math]I[/math] and names, and punctuate direct speech so the reporting clause (said Jarnal) follows proper comma/quotation rules.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The king said, "What harm did I do then that you should seek to take my life with your own hand?" "You killed my father and my two brothers," the young man replied.

Explanation:
The correct punctuation is: "The king said, 'What harm did I do, then, that you should seek to take my life with your own hand?'" "You killed my father and my two brothers," the young man replied.  
This is correct because direct speech must be placed in quotation marks and the pronoun [math]I[/math] and the first word of a quoted sentence are capitalized.  
Also, a question mark stays inside the quotation for the king's question, and a comma is used before the closing quotation mark when a dialogue tag (the young man replied) follows.

Robert Bruce, the king of Scotland, was defeated at a war and failed to regain his country's freedom several times. Naturally he was in a very dejected mood. Sitting in his hideout, he lost himself in deep thought.

Explanation:
The correct answer is right because repeated defeats and failed attempts naturally make the king feel sad and hopeless, and his sitting alone in a hideout and losing himself in deep thought shows a brooding, dejected mood. From context clues—defeat, isolation, and inward reflection—we infer his emotional state (dejection/pensiveness).

Question:
Use punctuation marks where necessary in the following text:

Where are you going now Karim Said I am going to hospital My brother is ill I ve to stay with him in the hospital

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Punctuation:

"Where are you going now?" Karim said. "I am going to hospital. My brother is ill. I've to stay with him in the hospital." ("আপনি এখন কোথায় যাচ্ছেন?" করিম বলল। "আমি হাসপাতালে যাচ্ছি। আমার ভাই অসুস্থ। আমাকে তার সাথে হাসপাতালে থাকতে হবে।")

Explanation:
"Where are you going now, Karim?" I said. "I am going to the hospital. My brother is ill. I have to stay with him in the hospital."

Use a question mark for the direct question and a comma before the name being addressed (vocative), end statements with periods and capitalize "I"; also prefer "I have to" and "the hospital" for standard English.

once my mother said to me who came to you my friend rafiq mom she asked what did he want i said his mother is ill he needs some money i have given him five hundred taka my mother said wonderful

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Punctuation :

Once my mother said to me, "Who came to you?" "My friend Rafiq, mom." She asked, "What did he want?" I said, "His mother is ill. He needs some money. I have given him five hundred taka." My mother said, "Wonderful!” (একবার আমার মা আমাকে বললেন, "তোমার কাছে কে এসেছিলো?" "আমার বন্ধু, রফিক, মা।" তিনি জিজ্ঞেস করলেন, "সে কী চেয়েছিল?” আমি বললাম, "তার মা অসুস্থ। তার কিছু টাকা দরকার। আমি তাকে পাঁচশ টাকা দিয়েছি।" মা বললেন, "চমৎকার!")

Explanation:
Capitalize the first word of each sentence and proper nouns (e.g., "Rafiq"), enclose spoken words in quotation marks and use commas to introduce them (She asked, "What did he want?"), and use question marks for direct questions and periods for statements. Also separate clauses with commas where needed (I said, "His mother is ill; he needs some money.") to make the meaning clear.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Gap filling with articles or prepositions:

(a) an; (b) from; (c) x; (d) with; (e) the; (f) x; (g) x; (h) for; (i) a; (j) of.

Explanation:

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Punctuation:

"Why are you putting the foods in your pocket, sir? Why don't you eat?" asked the nobleman.."I'm doing the right thing. My dress deserves these rich dishes," replied Sheikh Sa'adi. "I'm sorry. I don't understand what you mean to say," said the nobleman. ("আপনি খাবারগুলো পকেটে রাখছেন কেন, স্যার? আপনি খান না কেন?” সম্ভ্রান্ত লোকটি জিজ্ঞেস করলেন। "আমি ঠিক কাজটি করছি। আমার পোশাক এই উন্নতমানের/দামি খাবারের যোগ্য," শেখ সা'দী উত্তর দিলেন। "আমি দুঃখিত। আমি বুঝতে পারছি না আপনি কী বলতে চাচ্ছেন," সম্ভ্রান্ত লোকটি বললেন।)

Explanation:
The correct version encloses each spoken sentence in quotation marks and places the punctuation (question mark, comma, or period) inside those quotes, with a comma before the dialogue tag when the tag follows a quotation (e.g., "Why are you putting the foods in your pocket, sir?" asked the nobleman). Each new speaker begins a new sentence so attributions like "asked the nobleman" or "replied Sheikh Sa'adi" are clearly separated from the quoted speech, making the dialogue clear and grammatically correct.

Solution:
Punctuation:

Mainul Islam is a qualified farmer in Naogaon. He lives in his village with his two brothers. When he was asked, "What makes you decide to stay here in this village?" He replied, "Look, it's true that we could leave this village for a city life, but it didn't attract us." (মইনুল ইসলাম নওগাঁর একজন দক্ষ কৃষক। তিনি তার দুই ভাইকে নিয়ে গ্রামে থাকেন। যখন তাকে জিজ্ঞেস করা হল, "কী আপনাকে এই গ্রামে থাকতে সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়ায়?" তিনি উত্তর দিলেন, "দেখুন, এটা সত্য যে আমরা শহরের জীবনের জন্য এই গ্রাম ছেড়ে যেতে পারতাম, কিন্তু এটি আমাদের আকর্ষণ করেনি।")

Explanation:
Punctuation clarifies sentence boundaries and speech: use periods for statements, commas after introductory phrases and to separate clauses, a question mark for direct questions, quotation marks for spoken words, and apostrophes for contractions. Correctly punctuated: When he was asked, "What makes you decide to stay here in this village?" he replied, "Look, it's true that we could leave this village for a city life, but it didn't attract us."

My dear friends I am here to tell you about an important discovery said the cunning fox I have discovered that our tails are unnecessary How strange Is it unnecessary said the other foxes

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Punctuation:

"My dear friends, I am here to tell you about an important discovery," said the cunning fox. "I have discovered that our tails are unnecessary." "How strange! Is it unnecessary?" said the other foxes. ("প্রিয় বন্ধুরা, আমি এখানে তোমাদেরকে একটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ আবিষ্কার সম্পর্কে বলতে এসেছি," ধূর্ত শিয়ালটি বলল, "আমি আবিষ্কার করেছি যে আমাদের লেজগুলো অপ্রয়োজনীয়।" "কী অদ্ভুত। এটা কি অপ্রয়োজনীয়?" অন্য শিয়ালগুলো বলল।)

Explanation:
"My dear friends, I am here to tell you about an important discovery," said the cunning fox. "I have discovered that our tails are unnecessary." "How strange! Is it unnecessary?" said the other foxes.

This punctuation marks direct speech with commas and quotation marks, uses a comma after the vocative "My dear friends," ends declarative sentences inside quotes with periods, and uses an exclamation mark and question mark to show surprise and a question.

"Why aren't you going to school?" said mother to her son. He said, "I am waiting for my friend to come and go to school together." ("তুমি স্কুলে যাচ্ছ না কেন?" মা তার ছেলেকে বললেন। সে বলল, "আমি আমার বন্ধুর আসার এবং একসাথে স্কুলে যাওয়ার জন্য অপেক্ষা করছি।")

Explanation:
"Mother asked her son, 'Why are you not going to school?' He said, 'I am waiting for my friend to come so that we can go to school together.'"

Capitalize the first word of each sentence and the pronoun "I", use quotation marks for direct speech with the question mark inside the mother's quote, and separate the speech from the tag with a comma and a new capitalized sentence for the reply.

Mainul Islam is a qualified farmer in Naogaon. He lives in his village with his two brothers. When he was asked, "What makes you decide to stay here in this village?" He replied, "Look, its true that we could leave this village for a city life, but it didn't attract us."

Explanation:
Each independent sentence needs an end punctuation (a period or a question mark), and direct speech should be enclosed in quotation marks with the question mark placed inside the quotes for a spoken question. Commas separate introductory words (e.g., "Look,") and clauses, and contractions require apostrophes (e.g., "didn't", "it's"), so the corrected text uses periods, commas, quotation marks, a question mark, and apostrophes accordingly.

Also put a comma after the reporting verb before the reply, use a comma after "Look" and apostrophes in contractions ("it's", "didn't"), and end the reply with a period.

Question:

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Have you killed the rats?" said the mayor. "Yes, I have," replied the piper. "Give me the promised money." "How funny you are!" said the mayor, "Take only fifty."

Explanation:
The correct answer punctuates each speaker’s words with quotation marks, starts each quoted sentence with a capital letter, and uses the proper end punctuation (a question mark inside the quotes for questions and a comma before the reporting verb when the sentence continues). So it should read: "Have you killed the rats?" said the mayor. "Yes, I have," replied the piper. "Give me the promised money." "How funny you are!" said the mayor. "Take only fifth."

Question:
mr. hasan is a renowned english teacher has been teaching in our school for the past five years he is honest and sincere he is our favourite teacher we love him much

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Mr. Hasan is a renowned English teacher; has been teaching in our school for the past five years. He is honest and sincere. He is our favourite teacher. We love him much.

[Note: In a compound sentence if there is no coordinating conjunction, we can use (;) instead of coordinating conjunction. Ref: Wren and Martin]

Explanation:
Correct sentence: "Mr. Hasan is a renowned English teacher. He has been teaching in our school for the past five years. He is honest and sincere. He is our favourite teacher; we love him very much." Capitalization is needed for the title and proper noun ("Mr.", "Hasan") and the language name ("English"), sentences must be separated with proper punctuation, and "very much" is the natural idiom rather than "much."

Sohel asked Alam Friend have you ever visited the National Memorial at Savar in Dhaka Wow how Splendid it is Yes I havent yet gone there said Alam.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Sohel asked Alam, "Friend, have you ever visited The National Memorial at Savar in Dhaka? Wow! How splendid it is!" "Yes. I haven't yet gone there," said Alam.

[Note: As there is a negative sentence after yes, yes is considered as a sentence.]

Explanation:
The correct version uses quotation marks and appropriate punctuation because Sohel's words are a question ("Have you ever visited...?"), the reaction is an exclamation ("How splendid it is!"), and Alam's reply is a negative statement with the present perfect to show experience up to now ("I haven't yet gone there."). Using these forms and punctuation makes the meaning clear and fits the rules for direct speech and tense (present perfect for past experience).

Once a rich banker said to a poor cobbler, "How much do you earn a year?" The cobbler replied laughing.” I never count in this way. I earn barely enough to pass a day and I'm happy." "Are you really happy?" said the banker.

Explanation:
The cobbler measures success by daily sufficiency rather than accumulating wealth, so he feels content when his daily needs are met. Therefore the correct answer—that he is truly happy—is right because his happiness comes from simplicity and present satisfaction, not from riches.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
I said to the old man, "What are you doing?" "I am watching the boy swimming in the pond," he said. "How happy they are! May Allah bless them." "Let me sit by you and enjoy the scene." I said.

Explanation:
Explanation: In direct speech, each speaker’s words are enclosed in quotation marks and any question marks, exclamation marks or periods that end the spoken sentence go inside the quotes; reporting verbs like "said" or "replied" are separated from the quote by a comma when the quote continues and the quoted sentence begins with a capital letter. Hence the sentence is correctly punctuated as: I said to the old man, "What are you doing?" He said, "I am watching the boy swimming in the pond." He added, "How happy they are! May Allah bless them. Let me sit by you and enjoy the scene."

My mother said to me, "Where are you going?" "I am going to school," said I. "Did you go to school yesterday?"

Explanation:
Correct indirect speech: My mother asked me where I was going; I said (that) I was going to school; she asked whether I had gone to school the day before. Explanation: In reported speech we backshift tenses (am going → was going, did go → had gone), change yes/no questions to use "whether/if", and change time words (yesterday → the day before) and pronouns as needed.

Solution:
Monira said to Protiva, "How does the question seem to you? Have you got everything common?” “No, one item is uncommon to me. What about you?" said Protiva. "I'm in the same position like you," replied Monira.

Explanation:
The sentences should be corrected to: "Nothing is unfamiliar to me" (or "No item is uncommon to me") because "no one item" is ungrammatical—use "nothing" or "no + singular noun." Also say "I'm in the same position as you" (not "like you") because after "same" we use "as" to compare.

Use a comma before the reporting verb when the speech continues into the tag (e.g., "…," shouted the two rats), capitalize the first word inside the quotes, and fix contractions/punctuation (e.g., "it's", "haven't") so the meaning and grammar are clear.

"What's your programme after the examination?" asked Ratul. Nabil said, "I haven't yet decided. Can you suggest any?" "Let's go on a picnic," said Ratul. "What an excellent idea!"

It also uses apostrophes in contractions (e.g., "haven't") and places each speaker’s words as a separate sentence followed by the reporting phrase (e.g., "asked Ratul", "said Nabil").

The right action is to give the note to the teacher or school office and try to find its owner, because keeping it would be taking someone else’s property and the teacher can safeguard it until the rightful owner claims it. This follows the principles of honesty and responsibility, teaching respect for others’ belongings and setting a good example.

Question:
why are you putting up the food in your pocket why don’t you eat asked the noble man i am doing the right thing replied sheikh sadi

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Why are you putting up the food in your pocket? Why don't you eat?" asked the nobleman. "I am doing the right thing." replied Sheikh Sa'adi.

Explanation:
The correct answer is right because Sheikh Sadi is not selfishly hiding food but saving it—likely to give to someone in need or to prevent waste—so his reply “I am doing the right thing” shows charity and foresight. This teaches the moral idea that self-restraint and thinking of others (or avoiding waste) can be more virtuous than immediate personal gratification.

Question:
why dont you attend classes regularly the teacher said to the boy you cannot expect good result unless you attend classes be regular in class

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Why don't you attend classes regularly?" the teacher said to the boy. "You can't expect good, results unless you attend classes. Be regular in class."

Explanation:
The teacher asked the boy why he did not attend classes regularly, told him that he could not expect good results unless he attended classes, and advised him to be regular in class. We backshift verbs in reported speech (don't → did not, cannot → could not), change pronouns (you → he), and turn the imperative into a reporting verb + to‑infinitive (be regular → advised him to be regular).

Question:
oh my lord please dont kill the child said the first woman to the king solomon let her have it king solomon said to them now everything is clear to me pointing the first woman he said to the servant give her the child she is the mother of the baby

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Oh, my Lord! please don't kill the child," said the first woman to King Solomon. "Let her have it." King Solomon said to them, "Now everything is clear to me." Pointing the first woman, he said to the servant, "Give her the child. She is the mother of the baby."

Explanation:
The first woman’s plea to spare the child showed she valued the baby’s life above winning the dispute, a reaction a true mother would have; Solomon used that compassionate response as evidence of real motherhood and therefore gave her the child.

Question:
my sons listen to me said rahman an old farmer a great treasure lies hidden in the land there i am going to leave it for you the sons asked how shall we find it

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"My sons, listen to me," said Rahman, an old farmer. "A great treasure lies hidden in the land there. I am going to leave it for you." The sons asked, "How shall we find it?"

Explanation:
The sentence is direct speech, so each spoken line must be enclosed in quotation marks with commas or other punctuation before or after the speech tag; for example: "My sons, listen to me," said Rahman, an old farmer. "A great treasure lies hidden in the land there; I am going to leave it for you." The sons asked, "How shall we find it?" This is correct because commas separate the speech tag, the semicolon links the two related clauses, and the question mark marks the sons' question.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Thomas Alva Edison, a great scientist, was born in 1847 in Ohio, America. As a little boy, he was very inquisitive. He always wanted to know how things were done. Very early in life, he showed that he was full of curiosity, a quality which is so important to inventors.

Explanation:
His constant curiosity made him observe problems, ask questions, and try many experiments, which led to useful inventions—this is why calling Edison a great scientist is correct. Curiosity is the key trait for inventors because it motivates investigation, repeated testing, and learning from failures until a solution is found.

Solution:
The lion roared, "How dare you wake me up! I'll kill you." The mouse cried, "Please, let me go. I didn't mean to wake you up."

Explanation:
Explanation: The lines are direct speech, so each speaker’s words must be enclosed in quotation marks with proper punctuation inside (a question mark for "How dare you…?", an exclamation for "I'll kill you!"). Also capitalize the first word inside each quote and place a comma after the reporting verb (roared, cried) before the opening quote, which correctly shows who is speaking and the tone.

Solution:
After supper when I began to set out, Lucy trembled in fear and said, "Alfred dear, are you quite sure that the letter really came from your chief?" I laughed, told her not to be afraid and hurried out of the room and walked down the street.

Explanation:
The correct version capitalizes the sentence start and proper names and puts Lucy’s spoken words in quotation marks with a question mark because she is asking a question. Commas are used to set off the introductory clause and the speech tag, and commas/conjunctions join the narrator’s actions to avoid a run‑on sentence.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
My dear Mother,

Your letter is just to hand. It seems to me that you are anxious for me. Why? You need not think about me.

Explanation:
The corrected sentence is: "My dear mother, your letter is just to hand. It seems to me that you are anxious for me, but you need not think about me." This is right because splitting into two sentences and adding "but" makes the contrast clear, and "need not" is a modal phrase that reassures her there is no necessity to worry.

Question:

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Did people use stamps in those days?" asked Rafiq. "Yes," answered Mr. Jamal. The first stamps were used in 1840." "Are they easy to get now?" asked Rafiq. "They are very difficult to get," his uncle replied.

Explanation:
The corrected version is right because each spoken sentence needs proper punctuation and capitalization: questions end with a question mark and statements with a period. When a speaker tag follows, use a comma before the closing quote (e.g., "Yes," answered Mr. Jamal), and begin each quoted sentence with a capital letter.

"Are you ill?" he said coldly. "No", I said. "Then why are you sitting when all others are working? Go out at once and give them a hand."

Explanation:
The correct punctuation is: "Are you ill?" he said coldly. "No," I said. "Then why are you sitting when all others are working? Go out at once and give them a hand." This is right because direct speech needs quotation marks, questions keep the question mark inside the quotes, a comma follows quoted short answers before the speaker tag, and the speaker tag is not capitalized when it continues the sentence.

"Give me a few grains of corns. I am dying of hunger," said the grasshopper. "But what did you do in the summer? Didn't you store any grain?" the ant remarked, "I was too busy singing."

Explanation:
The ant’s response is right because the grasshopper spent the summer singing instead of storing food, so he failed to prepare and cannot expect help now. The story teaches the importance of foresight, hard work, and personal responsibility to avoid hardship.

Question:

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The man said to me. "Where are you going?" "I am going to school," said I. "Did you go to school yesterday?" "No," I replied. "Why didn't you go?" "I was very busy," said I.

Explanation:
In reported speech we backshift tenses, change pronouns and keep question word order as a statement. So "Where are you going?" becomes "He asked me where I was going," "I am going to school" → "I said (that) I was going to school," "Did you go to school yesterday?" → "He asked if I had gone to school yesterday," "No" → "I replied that I had not," "Why didn’t you go?" → "He asked why I hadn’t gone," and "I was very busy" → "I said (that) I had been very busy."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Bangladesh is a small country. With a population of about sixteen crore, she can hardly make headway. So, we should work hard to keep pace with the rest of the world.

Explanation:
The sentence has capitalization, punctuation and clarity issues: begin with a capital "Bangladesh", avoid a run-on by separating clauses, and prefer the neutral pronoun "it" in formal writing. Also express the population clearly (e.g., "about sixteen crore" or "about 160 million"). Corrected example: "Bangladesh is a small country with a population of about sixteen crore (about 160 million); it can hardly make headway, so we should work hard to keep pace with the rest of the world."

Question:
the teacher said to the boy where are you going now i am going to school said the boy did you go to school yesterday no the boy replied why did you not go i was suffering from fever said the boy

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The teacher said to the boy, "Where are you going now?" "I am going to school," said the boy. "Did you go to school yesterday?" "No," the boy replied. "Why did you not go?" "I was suffering from fever, said the boy.

Explanation:
Because the reporting verb is in the past ("said"), all present and past tenses backshift: "are going" becomes "was going" and "I was suffering" becomes "he had been suffering." Yes/no questions are introduced with if/whether and past simple ("Did you go yesterday?") becomes past perfect ("if/whether he had gone the day before"), and time words change ("now" → "then", "yesterday" → "the day before").

Question:
“How lovely the doll is! I’ll buy it,” said Mona. “No, it is not durable. Tomorrow we’ll visit another village fair. Then you can buy another doll. Let’s go now,” said mother. “You must buy me a good doll,” said Mona. “Yes,” replied mother.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Mona exclaimed with joy that the doll was very lovely. She told her mother that she would buy it. Mother replied in the negative saying that it was not durable. She added that the next day they would visit another village fair and then she (Mona) could buy another doll. Saying that mother proposed to her (Mona) that they should go then. Then Mona told her mother that she had to buy her (Mona) a good doll. Mother agreed with her.

Explanation:
The correct indirect-speech version uses backshifting of tenses, changes exclamations to "exclaimed" or "said" and shifts time/place words (e.g., "tomorrow" → "the next day"). For example, Mona’s “How lovely the doll is! I’ll buy it,” becomes Mona exclaimed that the doll was lovely and that she would buy it; Mother’s “Tomorrow we’ll visit another village fair” becomes she said they would visit the next day and urged them to go then. Imperatives like “Let’s go now” become suggestions or urgings (she told them to go), and direct requests like “You must buy me a good doll” become Mona insisted that her mother must/should buy her a good doll, with the short reply “Yes” reported as agreement.

Rosamond said to her mother, “What is it, Mum? I didn’t want this black thing and the terrible smell.” Mother said, “I don’t know, my dear. “Rosamond again said to her mother, “But what shall I do with it?” Mother said, “I can’t tell.” “Okay, Mum, I must pour it out and fill the jar with fresh water.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Addressing her mother as Mum, Rosamond asked her what it was. She also (R) said that she (R) had not wanted that black thing and the terrible smell. In reply mother told her affectionately that she (M) didn't know it. But Rosamond again asked her mother what she (R) would do with that. Mother again replied that she couldn't tell. Rosamond said that it was okay and told her mother endearingly that she (R) had to pour it out and fill the jar with fresh water.

Explanation:
The black thing and terrible smell show the water or its contents are contaminated or rotten, so keeping it could be unsafe or unpleasant. Since the mother cannot identify or advise about the contamination, Rosamond’s decision to pour it out and refill the jar with fresh water is the sensible, hygienic choice.

Explanation:
The rickshaw‑puller asks “Where?” to learn the destination, and when told “railway station” he replies he will go only if paid 200 taka—so the correct answer (that he demanded fare) follows directly from his conditional reply. This teaches reading dialogue by noting questions that ask for information and responses that state conditions or requests.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The guardian politely asked the headmaster if he (g) might go in. The headmaster replied in the affirmative and requested him (g) to come in. The guardian said that they, all the guardians along with him (H) had to do something for the betterment of their children. He (g) also said that they were losing their morality. The headmaster suggested that they should plan something for their betterment.

Explanation:
When converting to reported speech we shift tense and change forms: a question like “May I come in?” becomes the guardian asking if he [math]might[/math] come in (because [math]may[/math] → [math]might[/math] in indirect speech), and an imperative like “Yes, come in, please” becomes the headmaster telling him to come in (imperative → told/requested + to‑infinitive). The guardian’s remark about guardians doing something is reported as him saying that all the guardians, along with the headmaster, must do something for the children’s betterment and that the children were losing their morality (present progressive → past progressive). “Let’s plan something” is reported as the headmaster suggesting that they plan (or should plan) something.

Hira asked Mira what her (M) programme was after the examination. Míra replied that she (M) had not decided and asked Hira if she (H) could suggest any. In response, Hira proposed that they should go on a picnic. Mira then exclaimed with joy that it was an excellent idea.

Explanation:
Explanation: The direct exclamation "What an excellent idea it is!" is reported by changing the exclamatory form into a statement: "that it was an excellent idea." We also change the tense (present to past) and use a reporting verb that shows exclamation, so "said" becomes "exclaimed." Therefore the correct reported form is "Mira exclaimed that it was an excellent idea."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The teacher wished the students good morning and asked them how they were. The students respectfully replied that they were fine and asked the teacher how he was. The teacher replied that he was fine too and told them to sit down. Then he asked them if they had prepared their lesson. They sorrowfully/sadly replied with respect that they had not prepared their lesson.

Explanation:
This is direct speech converted to reported speech, so the reporting verbs (said, asked, replied) are past and we shift tenses back: e.g., “We are fine” becomes “they said they were fine,” and “Have you prepared your lesson?” becomes “he asked them if they had prepared their lesson.” Pronouns and possessives also change (we → they, our → their) to match the new speaker and subject.

Question:
“Have you ever been to Cox’s Bazar?” asked Shahab. “No, I have never,” replied Labib. “But I desire for visiting the place.” “I had an opportunity to visit the sea-beach last year,” said Shabab. “Let us go there this week,” said Labib.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Shabab asked Labib if (whether) he (L) had ever been to Cox's Bazar. Labib replied in the negative and said that he had never been (gone) there. But he said that he desired for visiting the place. Shabab said that he had an opportunity to visit the seabeach the previous year. Labib proposed to Shabab that they should (might) go there that week

Explanation:
When converting to reported speech, tenses and time expressions shift back: present perfect ([math]have/has + past participle[/math]) becomes past perfect ([math]had + past participle[/math]), "this/last" become "that/the previous" and imperatives/suggestions become reported suggestions. So Shahab’s question becomes "Shahab asked if he had ever been to Cox’s Bazar," Labib’s "No, I have never" becomes "Labib replied that he had never been," Shabab’s past comment stays past perfect ("he had had an opportunity… the previous year"), and "Let us go there this week" becomes "Labib suggested going there that week."

Question:
“Konika, have you done your English lesson today?” asked the teacher. “Yes, sir,” she replied. “But I have not understood one gramatical point.” The teacher assured her saying, “Come to my room. I will help you understand the point.” “Thank you, sir,” she smilingly said.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The teacher asked Konica if she had done her English lesson that day. She respectfully replied in the affirmative and said that she had not understood one grammatical point. The teacher assured her telling her to go to his room. He again said that he would help her understand the point. She smilingly thanked him respectfully.

Explanation:
Explanation: The word "gramatical" is a spelling error; it should be "grammatical." "Smilingly" is not a standard adverb in this context; use the participial form or phrase—e.g. "she said, smiling" or "she said with a smile." Also place a comma before the participial phrase ("The teacher assured her, saying…") to separate it from the main clause.

Question:
The teacher said to the girl, “Do you think that honesty is the best policy?” The girl said, “Yes, sir, I think so.” “Then learn to be honest from your childhood,” said the teacher. “Thank you, sir,” said the girl. “May Allah bless you,” said the teacher.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The teacher asked the girl if she thought that honesty is the best policy. The girl respectfully replied in the affirmative and said that she thought so. Then the teacher advised her (s) to learn to be honest from her childhood. The girl respectfully thanked him (t). The teacher prayed that Allah might bless her.

Explanation:
The correct answer identifies the teacher’s sentence “Then learn to be honest from your childhood” as advice (an imperative) given after the girl agreed that honesty is best. The dialogue shows speech functions in order—question (opinion), agreement, advice, gratitude, and a blessing—so recognizing the imperative/advice is why that option is right.

Question:
The girl said to the teacher, “Sir, I shall be grateful if you kindly lend me the book you praised highly in the classroom yesterday.” The teacher said, “I have become really happy to know that you are eager to read this book. You are welcome to any of my books that you like.” “Thank you, sir,” said the girl. “You are welcome,” said the teacher.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Addressing him as sir, the girl respectfully told the teacher that she would be grateful if he kindly lent her the book he had praised highly in the classroom the previous day. The teacher said that he had become really happy to know that she was eager to read that book. He added that she was welcome to any of his books that she liked. The girl thanked him politely. Then the teacher told her that she was welcome.

Explanation:
When reported, pronouns, verb tenses and time words change: the girl’s “I shall be grateful if you kindly lend me the book you praised highly in the classroom yesterday” becomes “She said (that) she would be grateful if he lent her the book he had praised in the classroom the previous day,” because [math]\text{shall}\to\text{would}[/math], “you” → “he”, and “yesterday” → “the previous day.” The teacher’s reply becomes “He said he was very pleased to know she was eager to read it and that she was welcome to any of his books she liked,” following the same pronoun and tense shifts; finally “Thank you” → “she thanked him” and “You are welcome” → “he replied that she was welcome.” These changes follow the rules of sequence of tenses and shifting references in indirect speech.

Question:
Once a rich banker said to a poor cobbler, "How much do you earn a year?" The cobbler replied laughing, "I never count in this way. I earn barely enough to pass a day. And I'm happy." "Are you really happy?" said the banker.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Once a rich banker asked a poor cobbler how much he (c) earned a year. The cobbler replied laughing that he (c) never counted in that way. He (c) also added that he (c) earned barely enough to pass a day and he (c) was happy. Then the banker asked him (c) if he (c) was really happy.

Explanation:
The cobbler is right because he measures happiness by having enough each day and feeling content, not by comparing large sums of money; this shows happiness is subjective and comes from meeting needs and expectations. The banker’s view wrongly ties happiness to wealth, illustrating that more money doesn't automatically create greater well‑being.

Question:
The teacher said to the student, "Have you prepared your lesson today?" "No, sir," replied the student. The teacher said. "Why?" "I was suffering from headache yesterday. I shall do my work tomorrow," said the student.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The teacher asked the student if he (s) had prepared his lesson that day. The student respectfully replied in the negative and said that he hadn't. The teacher asked again why he (s) had not prepared his lesson. The student replied that he (s) had been suffering from headache the previous day. He (s) added that he (s) would do his (s) work the next day.

Explanation:
In reported speech the tense shifts back because the reporting verb is in the past: "Have you prepared your lesson today?" becomes "he asked if he had prepared his lesson that day" (present perfect → past perfect, "today" → "that day"). "I was suffering from headache yesterday" becomes "he said he had been suffering from a headache the day before" (past continuous → past perfect continuous, "yesterday" → "the day before"). "I shall do my work tomorrow" becomes "he said he would do his work the next day" ("shall" → "would", "tomorrow" → "the next day").

The teacher said to the boy, "Do you know that honesty is the best policy?" The boy said. "Yes, sir, I think so." "Then learn to be honest from your boyhood," said the teacher. "Thank you," said the boy. "May Allah help you," said the teacher.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The teacher asked the boy if he (b) knew that honesty is the best policy. Addressing him (t) as sir. the boy respectfully replied in the affirmative and said that he thought so. Then the teacher advised him (b) to be honest from his boyhood. The boy respectfully thanked him (t). The teacher prayed for the boy that Allah might help him.

Explanation:
Explanation: In reported speech the question "Do you know that honesty is the best policy?" becomes "asked him if he knew that honesty was the best policy" — yes/no questions use "if/whether" and present tense shifts to past. The imperative "Then learn to be honest from your boyhood" is reported as advice: "advised/told him to learn to be honest from his boyhood." Short remarks change to reporting verbs: "Thank you" → "thanked him," and "May Allah help you" → "prayed/wished that Allah might/would help him," with pronouns adjusted.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
All answers come directly from the speakers’ lines: the lady says “To Rajshahi” (destination), “Three first class tickets” (number = three and class = first class), and the officer says “they will cost you three thousands taka” (price). In dialogue questions, match each question word to the corresponding part of the reply—"where" → place, "how many" → number, "which class" → type/class, "how much" → cost—so you extract the required facts.

Options:

Options:

Solution:


Explanation:
In reported speech we backshift tenses and change pronouns: Rina’s question becomes, “Rina asked Sima why she did not get up early,” and Sima’s reply becomes, “she said that it was difficult for her to get up early.” Exclamations and advice are turned into statements or verbs of saying—“Alas! It is a bad habit” becomes a regretful remark in past tense, the conditional “If you leave… you can enjoy…” shifts to “if she got up early she could enjoy…,” and “Follow my advice” becomes “advised her to follow her advice.”

Explanation:
ক উত্তর: "shall we?" — কারণ "Let's..." বাক্যে আমরা নিজেরাও যোগদানে বলছি, তাই ট্যাগ প্রশ্নে "shall we?" ব্যবহার করা হয়।

খ উত্তর: "aren't I?" — কারণ সাধারণভাবে "I am" থাকা ট্যাগ প্রশ্নে আম-বাক্যের জন্য অপ্রচলিত "amn't I" নয়, বরং স্বাভাবিকভাবে "aren't I?" বলা হয় (বা সৌজন্যভাবে "am I not?")।

গ উত্তর: "doesn't it?" — কারণ "Morning" তৃতীয় পুরুষ একবচন, present simple দিয়ে হয়েছে; ট্যাগে সহায়ক ক্রিয়া "does" নেগেটিভ করে "doesn't it?" হয়।

ঘ উত্তর: "should they?" — কারণ "No one" একবচন ব্যক্তি নির্দেশ করে কিন্তু নেতিবাচক অর্থ রয়েছে, তাই ট্যাগে ইতিবাচক সাহায্যকারী ব্যবহার করে "should they?" বলা হয়।

ঙ উত্তর: "will you?" — কারণ এটি অনুরোধ/আজ্ঞা ধাঁচের বাক্য; এমন ইম্পেরেটিভ বাক্যে সাধারণ ট্যাগ হলো "will you?" (অথবা বেশি শিষ্টভাবে "would you?")।

Shabab said to Tahsin, “Did you visit the Shat Gombuj Mosque?” “No, I didn’t,” said Tahsin. “I visited there last week. How beautiful the mosque is!” said Shahab. “Let’s go there next year,” Tahsin said.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Shabab asked Tahsin if he (T) had visited the Shat Gambuj Mosque. Tahsin replied in the negative saying that he (T) hadn't visited the Shat Gambuj Mosque. Then Shabab said that he (S) had been there the previous week. He then exclaimed in wonder that the mosque was very beautiful. After that Tahsin proposed that they should go there the following year.

Explanation:
Explanation: In reported speech the past simple question "Did you visit...?" becomes past perfect, so it becomes "Shabab asked Tahsin if he had visited the Shat Gombuj Mosque." Negative reply "No, I didn't" is reported as "he said he hadn't." Shahab's "I visited there last week" becomes "he said he had visited it the previous week," and the exclamation "How beautiful the mosque is!" becomes "how beautiful the mosque was." "Let's go there next year" is a suggestion, reported as "Tahsin suggested they should go there the following year" or "Tahsin said they would go there the following year."

Shabab said to Tahsin, “Did you visit the Shat Gombuj Mosque?” “No, I didn’t,” said Tahsin. “I visited there last week. How beautiful the mosque is!” said Shahab. “Let’s go there next year,” Tahsin said.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
In reported speech we backshift tenses and turn questions into reported yes/no questions with if/whether, so Shabab’s “Did you visit the Shat Gombuj Mosque?” becomes “Shabab asked Tahsin if he had visited the Shat Gombuj Mosque.”  
Negatives and time words change accordingly: “No, I didn’t” → “he said he hadn’t,” and “last week” → “the previous week”; exclamations use verbs like “exclaimed” and tense shift: “How beautiful the mosque is!” → “he exclaimed how beautiful the mosque was.”  
Suggestions are reported with verbs like “suggested” plus a gerund and time change: “Let’s go there next year” → “Tahsin suggested going there the following year.”

Question:
My mother said, “Won’t you go to school today?” I said, “Mother, I feel feverish today. I don’t want to go to school.” “Ok, take a rest now. You should be more careful about your health,” said mother.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
My mother asked me if I would not go to school that day. In reply, I told mother that I felt feverish that day and so I didn't want to go to school. Mother said that it was alright and advised me to take rest then. She further told me that I should be more careful about my health.

Explanation:
এখানে সরাসরি বক্তব্যকে পরোক্ষ (reported) কথায় বদলে বলার নিয়ম অনুসরণ করা হয়েছে: প্রশ্নকে "asked" দিয়ে এবং "Won't you..." থেকে সময় ও কালের পরিবর্তন করে "if I would go to school that day" বলা হয়, প্রথম পুরুষ/প্রথম-পর্দায়কের পরিবর্তে উপযুক্ত সর্বনাম বদলে নেওয়া হয়েছে, এবং "today/now" → "that day/then" ও বর্তমান কাল → অতীত কালে পরিবর্তন করা হয়েছে; similarly নির্দেশ/পরামর্শকে "told" বা "advised" দিয়ে পরোক্ষভাবে প্রকাশ করা হয়েছে। এই পরিবর্তনগুলোই ঠিক উত্তরকে সঠিক করে কারণ এগুলোই reported speech-এর মৌলিক নিয়ম।

Question:
“Good morning, can I help you?” said the manager. “Yes, I was told to come over here to get a parking sticker. Is it the right place? “said the lady. “Yes, it is. What’s the registration number of your car? ” said the manager.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The manager wished the lady good morning and asked her if he could help her. The lady replied in the affirmative and said that she had been told to go over there to get a parking sticker. Out of curiosity, she again asked the manager if that was the right place. Then the manager replied in the affirmative and said that it was the right place and at the same time asked the lady what the registration number of her car was.

Explanation:
In reported speech, direct questions use “asked if/whether” and verbs shift back in time (for example, “can” → “could”, “is” → “was”, “was told” → “had been told”) and pronouns are changed as needed. So the correct indirect version uses these changes: the manager asked if he could help, the lady said she had been told to come for a parking sticker and asked if that was the right place, and the manager replied that it was and asked what the registration number of her car was.

Question:
“My sons, listen to me. A great treasure lies hidden in the land. I am going to leave it to you.” “How will we find it?” said the sons. “You must dig the land for it,” said the old man.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The old man ordered his sons to listen to him and told them that a great treasure lay hidden in the land. He added that he was going to leave it to them. At that, the sons asked their father how they would find that. Then the old man told them that they had to dig the land for that.

Explanation:
The correct answer is that they must dig the land, because the old man clearly says the treasure lies hidden there and instructs them, “You must dig the land for it.” This tests reading comprehension: you infer the required action directly from the speaker’s words in the dialogue.

Question:
“What are you doing now, Rashed?” I said. “I am watching an interesting program on television.” “Aren’t you wasting your time?” “No, I don’t think so,” he said. “Remember, too much watching of TV makes people lazy.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
I asked Rashed what he was doing then. He replied that he was watching an interesting programme on television. I asked him again if he was not wasting his time. He replied in the negative and said that he did not think so. Then I advised him to remember that too much watching TV makes people lazy.

Explanation:
Explanation: In reported speech we normally shift tenses back, change pronouns and time words, and use appropriate reporting verbs. So “What are you doing now?” becomes He asked Rashed what he was doing then; “I am watching…” becomes He said (that) he was watching an interesting programme; “Aren’t you wasting your time?” becomes I asked if/whether he was wasting his time, and “No, I don’t think so” becomes He replied that he didn’t think so. Note: general truths (e.g., “makes people lazy”) are often backshifted to past (“made”) in reported speech, though they can stay in the present if still considered universally true.

Question:
“Dear friend, which book do you want?” “A Practical English Grammar’ of A. J. Thomson. I lost my copy yesterday,” said Oishe. “I can lend you. But return it in a week,” I said.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Addressing Oishe as dear friend, I asked her which book she wanted. She replied that she wanted A Practical English Grammar' of A.J. Thomson. She added that she had lost her copy the day before yesterday. Then I told her that I could lend her, and also told her to return it in a week.

Explanation:
Use "I can lend it to you" because "lend" normally takes a thing as a direct object; if you don’t name the thing you must say "it" (or include the object, e.g. "I can lend you my copy"). The book title should be marked (e.g. 'A Practical English Grammar') and the author is introduced with "by" rather than "of". In direct speech, when a sentence is followed by a reporting tag (like "said Oishe" or "I said"), replace the final full stop with a comma inside the closing quote: "I can lend it to you, but return it in a week," I said.

Question:
“Why did you not go to school yesterday, Rimu?” asked the mother. “I was ill, mum.” “How are you today?” “Well,” answered the girl. “Don’t worry for me.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The mother asked/enquired of/demanded of Rimu why she (R) had not gone to school the previous day. Addressing the mother as mum Rimu replied that she (R) had been ill. The mother again asked/enquired of/demanded of the girl how she (R) was that day. The girl replied/answered that she (R) was well and also told/requested not to worry for her/forbade to worry for her.

Explanation:
Correct, because Rimu herself says she missed school yesterday due to illness: "I was ill." Her answer "Well" shows she is better today, and "Don't worry for me" is a reassurance to her mother, so the dialogue gives the past reason for absence and the present condition.

The teacher said to the boy, “Do you know that honesty is the best policy?” The boy said, “Yes, sir, I think so.” “Then learn to be honest from your boyhood,” said the teacher. “Thank you, Sir,” said the boy. “May Allah grant you a long life,” said the teacher to boy.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The teacher asked the boy if he (b) thought that honesty is the best policy. The boy respectfully replied in the affirmative and said that he thought so. Then the teacher advised him (b) to be honest from his boyhood. The boy respectfully thanked him (t). The teacher prayed for the boy that Allah might grant him a long life.

Explanation:
Explanation: A yes/no question like "Do you know that honesty is the best policy?" is reported as "He asked the boy if/whether he knew that honesty was the best policy" because the question form changes to statement order and present tense shifts to past (is → was) under sequence of tenses. Likewise, "Yes, sir, I think so" becomes "the boy said/replied that he thought so" (think → thought); imperative/advice "Then learn to be honest from your boyhood" is reported as "the teacher advised him to learn to be honest from his boyhood"; "Thank you, Sir" becomes "the boy thanked him"; and the wish "May Allah grant you a long life" is reported as "the teacher prayed/wished that Allah might grant him a long life" (may → might).

Newspapers help him (c) enrich his general knowledge and make him aware of the (d) current issues both inside and outside the country. A man who doesn't read (e) newspapers is like a frog in a narrow (f) well.

Ans. (a) bookish; (b) competitive; (c) enrich; (d) burning; (e) newspaper; (f) well; (g) current; (h) cannot; (i) water; (j) knowledge.

Explanation:
These words fit both meaning and grammar: 'bookish' contrasts with the practical demands of the 'modern' world; newspapers 'enrich' a student's general knowledge and make him aware of 'current' issues; the proverb needs 'newspapers' and 'well' (a frog in a narrow well), and being ignorant of 'national' affairs he 'cannot' take part in discussions and feels like a fish out of 'water'; finally 'knowledge' correctly completes the idea of widening one's range.

Solution:


Explanation:
Correct words were chosen to fit both grammar and meaning: "problems" for (a) because "one of the greatest" requires a plural noun; "cities" for (b) since Dhaka and Chattogram are cities; "live" for (c) as the verb describing people on footpaths; "areas" for (d) because "rural areas" is the usual phrase; and "shortage" for (e) because we say an "acute shortage" of housing.  
"increasing" for (f) matches "cost ... day by day"; "difficult" for (g) and "poor" for (h) fit the phrase "difficult for the poor people"; "afford" for (i) is the correct verb with "cost"; and "needs" for (j) correctly completes "needs to be solved soon."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
ক "cultivating" নির্বাচন করা হয়েছে কারণ বাক্যে বিদেশি সবজি চাষ করার আগ্রহ বোঝাতে ক্রিয়ার প্রয়োজন এবং "interest in cultivating" হল সঠিক collocation।  
খ "to" সঠিক কারণ "add dimensions to" একটি স্থায়ী ইংরেজি প্রবাদবাক্য — কোনো কিছুকে অন্য কিছুর উপর প্রভাবিত বা সংযোজন হিসেবে বলা হয়।  
গ "young farmer" উপযুক্ত কারণ প্রসঙ্গে নতুন ও উদ্ভাবনী ফসল চাষকারী যুবককে নির্দেশ করা হচ্ছে।  
ঘ "dream" রাখা হয়েছে কারণ কোনো ব্যাক্তি সাধারণত একটি স্বপ্ন বা লক্ষ্য নিয়েই খামার শুরু করে; এখানে ধারণাগত অনুপ্রেরণা বোঝাতে এটি মানানসই।  
ঙ "commercial" ফার্ম মানে বাণিজ্যিকভাবে পরিচালিত খামার, যেটা বিদেশি উদ্ভিদগুলোর ব্যাপক চাষের বাস্তব প্রতিফলন।  
চ "exotic" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে কারণ curry leaves, lemongrass, broccoli ইত্যাদি দেশের প্রচলিত সবজির থেকে ভিন্ন বা বিদেশি—অর্থাৎ "exotic" মানায়।  
ছ "in" প্রয়োজন কারণ এখানে বলা হচ্ছে বিদেশি ফসলের চাষ ঘটছে আমাদের দেশের মধ্যে: "cultivation of foreign crops in our country"।  
জ "local" সঙ্গত কারণ বাক্যে স্থানীয় কৃষকরা এবং গ্রাহকদের উভয়কেই অনুপ্রাণিত করে—সুতরাং "local farmers" মানানসই।  
ঝ "diet" নেওয়া হয়েছে কারণ এখানে নিয়মিত খাদ্যাভ্যাস ও পুষ্টি সম্পর্কে বলা হচ্ছে, তাই "diet" শব্দটি পুরোপুরি মেলে।  
ঞ "export" উপযুক্ত কারণ মানসম্মত উৎপাদন ও প্যাকেজিং নিশ্চিত করলে ওই সবজি বিদেশে বিক্রি করা যায়—অর্থাৎ রপ্তানি করা সম্ভব।

But it is a matter of (g) — regret that a true friend is very (h) — today. A selfish man cannot be a (i) — friend. He always thinks of his (j) — interest.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A true friend is an asset. He stands by his friend in time of the danger. Normally he is not a greedy person. He always wishes for the welfare of his friends. But it is a matter of fact that an ideal friend is very rare today.

Explanation:

In the above sentences, the correct use of articles is to be mentioned.
There are three articles used in English Grammar.
'A', 'an' and 'the' are the three articles.
They are used with the nouns to specify their definiteness in the sentences.
'The' is the definite article.
'A' and 'an' are the indefinite articles.
'A' is used with words beginning with a consonant sound.
'An' is used with words beginning with a vowel sound.

Explanation:
Answers: a valuable, b by, c of, d a, e always, f his, g great, h rare, i true, j own. 

Reason: these choices fit common English collocations and grammar—'valuable' describes an asset, we say 'stand by' and 'time of', articles/possessives ('a', 'his', 'own') complete the noun phrases, 'always' shows habitual action, and 'great regret' + 'rare' and 'true' contrast correctly with 'selfish'.

But merely (h) — guidebooks keeps the students ignoble of the subject matter as they are written focusing on exam result (i) — a textbook covers all the details for holistic flourish (j) — a student.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: The correct words follow basic grammar patterns — "essential" takes the preposition "for" (a), "expect" is followed by the infinitive "to" (b), and a singular noun phrase needs the article "a" before "complete sense" (c). "In case of" (d) is the fixed phrase, "what is" (e) introduces the object clause the student will miss, and "written" (f) parallels "edited" as past participles describing textbooks. After verbs like "ignore" we use the gerund "reading" (g), "relying on" (h) is the correct phrasal verb, "whereas" (i) shows contrast, and "of" (j) indicates the relationship/possession ("flourish of a student").

Question:
Trees are (a) — to man in many ways. They provide us (b) — oxygen without which we cannot live more than a few minutes. They supply (c) — with vitamin and food, give us shade and help to (d) — drought and flood. Unfortunately, we cannot realize (e) — importance of trees. We cut them (f) — in large numbers. (g) — it is a suicidal attempt. (h) — we do not stop (i) — acts, soon our country will , no doubt , turn (j) — a desert.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) useful/important/significant/essential/beneficial/conducive; (b) with; (c) us/men/people; (d) prevent/control/protect; (e) the; (f) indiscriminately/aimlessly/irrationally/unwisely: (g) but/ though; (h) If; (i) such/these; (j) into.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) useful, (b) with, (c) us, (d) prevent, (e) the, (f) down, (g) Indeed, (h) If, (i) these, (j) into.  
These choices fit both meaning and grammar: "useful" describes the benefit to man; verbs like "provide" and "supply" require the preposition "with" and the recipient "us"; "cut down" is the correct phrasal verb, and "turn into" is the correct collocation for becoming a desert.  
"The" is the definite article before "importance", "prevent" expresses stopping drought/flood, "Indeed" emphasizes the warning, and "If we do not stop these acts" correctly introduces the conditional.

Question:
Trees bear a great impact (a) — the climate. If we destroy trees (b) — random, one day the country will turn (c) — a great desert. The country will bear the consequences of greenhouse (d) —. Again there will be no rain and as a result the country will face a great crises because ours is (e) — agricultural country and our economy is dependent on (f) —. Again our agriculture (g) — on rain. So trees have a (h) — effect on our climate. Trees keep the soil strong. Trees save us (i) — flood and many other natural (j) —.

Options:

Solution:
(a) on; (b) at; (c) into; (d) effect; (e) an; (f) agriculture; (g) depends; (h) great/significant/big; (i) from; (j) calamities/disasters.

Explanation:
Explanation: 
(a) "on" is the correct collocation: we say "impact on the climate." (b) "at random" means without order or plan. (c) "into" shows change of state: turn into a desert. (d) "effect" completes the common phrase "greenhouse effect." (e) "an" is the correct article before the vowel-starting noun "agricultural country." (f) "agriculture" is what the economy depends on. (g) "depends" agrees with the singular subject "our agriculture." (h) "positive" describes the beneficial effect of trees. (i) "from" shows protection: "save us from flood." (j) "disasters" is the suitable plural noun for many natural calamities.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা: এখানে "one of the most"–এর সাথে বিশেষণবাচক সর্বোচ্চ রূপ বোঝাতে নির্দিষ্ট আর্টিকেল "the" লাগে, আর জীবনে কিছু নির্দেশ করতে "in human life" এ preposition "in" প্রয়োজন। "A sound man cannot go without sleeping"–এ "a" অনির্দিষ্ট আর্টিকেল এবং "without" দিয়ে বোঝানো হয়েছে তাড়া/অপসারণ ছাড়া থাকা সম্ভব নয়। "the healing medicine of the troubled mind"–এ নির্দিষ্ট ঔষধ বোঝাতে "the" এবং অনুভব বা মনের জন্য "mind" ব্যবহার করা ঠিক; শেষে "indifferent to his work and responsibilities"–এ "to" প্রিপোজিশন ও "work" নামে বস্তুগত শব্দ প্রয়োজন।

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) "number" — the phrase "a great number of" correctly quantifies a plural noun ("people") to mean many.  
(b) "the" — "the world" is a specific, fixed phrase: "all over the world."  
(c) "it" — a pronoun referring to "English": "use it as a first language."  
(d) "a" — the indefinite article is required before "second language."  
(e) "rely" — "rely on" is the correct verb–preposition collocation meaning depend on English.  
(f) "countries" — plural noun fits because offices are in various countries.  
(g) "in" — the correct preposition for where advertisements are published: "published in newspapers."  
(h) "command" — the collocation "a good command (of/over) English" means strong ability or control.  
(i) "jobs" — plural because "people seeking jobs"; "a good one" refers to a job.  
(j) "without" — shows lack: "can’t expect to get a good one without knowing English."

Question:
The Eiffel Tower was named (a) — Gustavo Effiel, a Frenchman who built (b) — Tower. He graduated from the Central School of Engineering in Paris and went to work for a railway (c) — company. For years Gustave made plan (d) — plan of dams, factories, stations and structures of great size. All (e) — Europe engineers copied them. In the middle of 1880 a group of French industrialists persuade the government to organize (f) — World’s Fair (g) — Paris. Gustave Eiffel proposed a 989 foot tower of iron as symbol of the (h) —. Forty engineers and designers under Eiffel’s (i) — worked for two years. It was (j) — highest structure yet made by man.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) after; (b) the/this/that/the Eiffel Tower; (c) construction/engineering; (d) after; (e) over/ the/around/of; (f) a/the; (g) in; (h) fair/exhibition; (i) direction; (j) the.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) after, (b) the, (c) construction, (d) after, (e) over, (f) the, (g) in, (h) Exposition (or Fair), (i) direction, (j) the.

Use 'after' with "named" to show who it was named for, and "plan after plan" is an idiom meaning repeated plans; 'construction' and 'direction' are noun forms describing the type of company and Eiffel's leadership. 'Over' in "all over Europe" means throughout the region, 'in' shows location ("in Paris"), and 'the' is required before specific things (the World's Fair) and before superlatives (the highest).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) letters/wisdom; (b) even; (c) works/contributions/deeds/actions; (d) educated/honest/ important/ideal; (e) spreading/imparting; (f) teaches/advises/encourages; (g) differentiate/ distinguish; (h) In; (i) whom; (j) respect/honour.

Explanation:
The phrase "a man of good character" uses a noun phrase after "of" to describe his quality; "even" fits before "after his death" to show respect continues, and "good deeds" names the reason for that respect. "Ideal" correctly labels a model person; "promoting education" (a gerund phrase) shows his purpose, while "teaches" is the proper transitive verb and "distinguish between" is the correct collocation for separating right and wrong. "In fact" introduces a confirming remark; "whom" is the object of "should emulate," and "emulate" means to imitate or follow his example.

Question:
Illiteracy is not (a) — boon to us. It is undoubtedly a (b) —. It hinders all kinds (c) — development of a country. Illiteracy causes great (d) — to us. Since we are not (e) — of the gravity of the problem, we cannot take steps to increase our (f) — rate. As a result, we are (g) — behind. We have to depend (h) — the foreign aids. So, all should come forward (i) — to remove illiteracy. Then, the (j) — of our country will be possible.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) a; (b) curse; (c) of; (d) harm/problems; (e) conscious/aware; (f) literacy: (g) lagging; (h) on/upon; (i) unitedly/in order/jointly/combinedly; (j) progress/development/prosperity.

Explanation:
Explanation:
a "a" — the article is needed: "not a boon" is the correct phrase before a singular noun.
b "curse" — contrasts with "boon" and correctly conveys severe negative impact.
c "of" — fixed phrase "all kinds of development" requires the preposition "of".
d "harm" — "causes great harm" is the natural collocation for negative effects.
e "aware" — we say "not aware of the gravity" to mean lacking understanding of the problem’s seriousness.
f "literacy" — "literacy rate" is the standard term for the measure being increased.
g "falling" — the phrase "falling behind" correctly describes losing progress compared to others.
h "on" — the verb phrase is "depend on" (something).
i "in" — "come forward in removing illiteracy" fits the sentence; it means actively participate in the effort.
j "progress" — "the progress of our country" naturally expresses the desired positive outcome.

Question:
Time is very (a) —. Time which is lost once is lost forever. There is a proverb that time and tide (b) — for none. It is time which does not have any relative feelings. If it is not used (c) —, one must suffer (d) — the long run. (e) — the other hand we can go a long way (f) — realizing the value of time. Those who have become great have made (g) — use of time. They never put (h) — their work (i) — tomorrow. As a result, they have (j) — top position in society. So it is our duty to follow them.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) valuable/important/precious; (b) wait; (c) properly/sincerely/rightly/appropriately/wisely; (d) in; (e) On; (f) by/on/after; (g) proper/the; (h) off; (i) for; (j) assumed/achieved/secured/ reached/ gained/obtained.

Explanation:
"precious" is the natural collocation for time, and the proverb uses the base verb "wait" ("time and tide wait for none").  
"If it is not used" takes the adverb "properly" and we "suffer in the long run"; "On the other hand" is the fixed phrase and we say "go a long way by" + gerund.  
"made good use of" is the correct collocation, "put off" is the phrasal verb for postponing followed by "till" (or "until") tomorrow, and "attained" correctly describes achieving a top position.

He saw that a spider was trying to reach its target. Six times it tried and every time it failed. But it did not give (i) — its hope and finally at the seventh time it was successful (j) — its attempt.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) enemy/foe/rival/opponent; (b) away/out; (c) the; (d) country/common/the/his; (e) an; (f) for: gin; (h) resting/lying/sitting/ hiding; (i) up; (j) in.

Explanation:
Explanation: Choose words that fit both meaning and grammar of each blank.

a "enemy" fits the meaning; b "out" completes "driven out"; c "the" is the definite article before "English"; d "his" makes "his men"; e "an" is the correct article before the vowel-starting "unfortunate".

f "for" shows purpose; g "in" fits "in despair"; h "sitting" describes his action in the cave; i "up" completes "give up"; j "in" correctly forms "successful in its attempt."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) said/known/thought/considered; (b) the; (c) deviates/detaches; (d) of/called; (e) loved/respected/honoured/believed/liked; (f) all/everybody/everyone/anyone/anybody; (g) none/nobody; (h) Even/The; (i) honest; (j) in.

Explanation:
The phrase "Honesty is said to be the best policy" uses the fixed passive "said to be" and the definite article "the"; "strays from the path of morality" uses the correct verb + preposition ("stray from") and the possessive "of"; "admired by many but hated by some" is a natural contrast, "Some enemies..." introduces that contrast again, "honest and truthful" are the correct adjectives, and "throughout our life" correctly expresses duration. These choices follow normal English collocations and grammar, so they clearly convey that honesty is recommended and should be maintained for life.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) riser, (b) the, (c) in, (d) do, (e) On, (f) a, (g) in, (h) in, (i) it a, (j) rising.  
"Early riser" is the correct collocation; "the" specifies the particular fresh air, and "in the morning" requires the preposition "in"; "do" fits the verb phrase "do his work properly."  
"On the other hand" is the fixed contrast phrase; "a man" needs the indefinite article; both occurrences of "in" are the correct preposition ("in sleep", "in doing"); "make it a habit" is a fixed expression and "rising" is a gerund (noun) meaning waking early.

Explanation:
An appropriate set of words is: (a) "an" — use "an" before the vowel sound in "asset"; (b) "by" — the correct phrasal verb is "stand by" someone; (c) "of" — the fixed phrase is "in time of danger"; (d) "a" — use the indefinite article before a singular countable noun "greedy person"; (e) "always" — shows habitual action; (f) "his" — shows possession; (g) "of" — the phrase is "a matter of regret"; (h) "rare" — means not common; (i) "true" — matches the meaning "a true friend"; (j) "his own" — the collocation is "think of his own interest."

But (e)------ his/her lesson in time and do (f)----- in the examination. Punctually is (g) ----- key (h) ----- success. We all (i) ------ be punctual (j)---- our day-to-day life.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) great; (b) student/boy/girl; (c) late/irregular; (d) will/always; (e) a; (f) well/better; (g) the; (i) should/must/ought to; (j) in.

Explanation:
The sentence contrasts the consequences of lateness with the benefits of timely study, so words like "student" and "late" fit because a late pupil misses parts of lessons and therefore often lags behind, while verbs like "prepare/study" and the adverb "well" show that timely study leads to good exam results. "Punctuality is the key to success" is a fixed, grammatical phrase—hence "the" and "to" fit those blanks—and the final advice uses "should" and "in" to form "We all should be punctual in our day-to-day life." Choose words that both make grammatical sense and follow the logical cause–effect sequence: lateness → missed learning → poor performance; punctuality → timely preparation → success.

(d) "of" — "means of communication" is the correct fixed phrase.

(h) — ancient time journey was difficult. (i) — had to spend much (j) — and money for travelling. But we should remember that science has to be exploited for the greater welfare of mankind.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) science; (b) the; (c) companion/friend/partner; (d) done/made; (e) of; (f) gift/blessing/ boon/contribution; (g) easily/smoothly/comfortably; (h) In: (i) One/We/They; (j) time.

Explanation:
Explanation:
ক "science" — The sentence names the era we live in; "age of science" is the natural phrase meaning a period dominated by scientific progress.
খ "the" — "the influence of science" is definite and specific, so the definite article "the" is required.
গ "part" — "a constant part of our daily life" correctly expresses that science is always present in everyday activities.
ঘ "made" — "We have made the impossible things possible" uses the verb "made" to show that people caused that change.
ঙ "of" — The phrase is "by means of science," so the preposition "of" completes the expression "by means of."
চ "product" — "The modern civilization is a product of science" correctly shows civilization resulting from scientific development.
ছ "easily" — "At present we can easily travel" fits naturally to show travel is now simple.
জ "In" — "In ancient times journey was difficult" needs the preposition "In" to indicate that past period.
ঝ "people" — Referring to those in ancient times, "people had to spend..." is the appropriate subject.
ঞ "time" — "had to spend much time and money" correctly pairs "time" with "money" as things required for travelling.

Question:
Once there lived (a) —- poor man. He could hardly maintain his family (b) —- he did not have any land (c) —- cultivation. One day he bought (d) —- wonderful goose. The goose laid a (e) —- egg everyday. In a few months he became rich. But he was a (f) —- greedy man. He thought that there (g) —- more eggs in the belly of the goose. He wanted to get all the eggs (h) —- a time. So one day, he killed the goose and cut its belly open with (i) —- knife. But alas! there was no egg. Thus the greedy farmer (j) —- the useful goose.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) a; (b) because; (c) for/of; (d) a; (e) golden; (f) very; (g) were/would be; (h) at; (i) a; (j) lost/killed.

Explanation:
Explanation: 'a' is used before singular countable nouns, so (a), (d) and (i) are "a poor man", "a wonderful goose", "a knife". 'Because' gives the reason in (b), 'for' shows purpose in (c) ("land for cultivation"), 'golden' describes the egg in (e), and 'very' intensifies 'greedy' in (f). 'Were' agrees with the plural 'eggs' in (g), 'at' completes the phrase "at a time" in (h), and 'killed' correctly describes the action done to the goose in (j).

Man is the (a)----- of his own fate. If he makes a proper (b)----- of time and does his duties (c)----- , he is sure to improve and (d) ----- in life. But if he does (e)-----, he is sure to (f)------ too late and he will (g)------ when it is to drag a miserable life (h)------ day-to-day. To spoil time is (i)----- shorten one's life. For, our life is nothing (j)------ the sum total of hours, days and years.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) architect/maker/founder/builder; (b) use/division; (c) properly/accordingly; (d) prosper/ shine/succeed; (e) otherwise; (f) repent/regret; (g) have/be submitted/be bound; (h) from; (i) to; (j) but.

Explanation:
a architect; b use; c well; d prosper; e otherwise; f repent; g have to; h from; i to; j but.  
These words fit both meaning and grammar: "architect" means one who shapes his fate; "use of time" is the correct collocation and "well" is the adverb for "does his duties"; "prosper" matches "improve and ___ in life"; "otherwise" contrasts the two cases and "repent" expresses late regret; "have to" shows the unavoidable consequence, "from day-to-day" is the idiom, "to shorten" requires the infinitive, and "nothing but" means "only."  
Overall idea: proper use of time and dutiful work lead to success, while wasting time brings late regret and a miserable life.

Explanation:
Filled answers: (a) an, (b) over, (c) of, (d) for, (e) in, (f) in the, (g) along, (h) the, (i) learn, (j) the.

These choices follow standard grammar and collocations: use "an" before a vowel sound, "all over the world" is the common phrase, "importance of" and "for higher education"/"written in English" use the correct prepositions, "speak and write in the standard form" requires "in the", "along with" means together with the mother tongue, "the age" uses the definite article, and "learn" is the correct verb for acquiring a language.

Solution:
Gap filling with suitable words:

(a) wide; (b) second; (c) compulsory; (d) learn; (e) reasons; (f) continuous; (g) writing; (h) yocabulary; (i) environment; (j) across.

Explanation:
(a) wide — "world-wide" is a common compound; "wide" completes "world-wide importance" meaning global importance.  
(b) second — "the second language" fits here because English is an additional language after the mother tongue.  
(c) compulsory — "compulsory subject" means it is required study from class I to XII.  
(d) speak — context refers to ability to use the language orally, so "speak well" is correct.  
(e) reasons — "there are so many reasons behind it" uses the plural noun "reasons."  
(f) proper — "proper development of the syllabus" is the correct collocation meaning suitable or adequate development.  
(g) writing — exams are described as being based on written ability, so "writing skill" fits.  
(h) practice — lack of regular practice explains poor performance, so "practice" is appropriate.  
(i) opportunities — "English-speaking opportunities" means chances to use the language, which are lacking.  
(j) throughout — "throughout the country" correctly means all over the country, indicating a nationwide shortage.

(a) ability; (b) human; (c) respective; (d) to; (e) without; (f) smoothly; (g) acquiring; (h) on; (i) place; (j) process.

Explanation:
Explanation: (a) "ability" names the capacity to use language; (b) "human" and (c) "social" show that people learn language from their social surroundings, and (d) "to" is the infinitive required after "begin" (begin to acquire). If the process continues (e) "without" obstruction a baby can join the same-language (f) "community" within a few years; after "for" we need the gerund (g) "acquiring", and the phrasal verb (h) "goes on" fits with "listening, speaking…". Finally, (i) "takes place" is the correct collocation and (j) "way" explains the manner in which we acquire our first language.

Explanation:
Explanation: The passage talks about what an examination does and its consequences, so (a) "assess" or "test" fits because an exam measures academic knowledge, and (b) "students" (or "candidates") are the people being assessed. (c) "fair" or "impartial" is required for correctness, and the authority must (d) "administer" or "supervise" it in the best (e) "manner" or "way" — these words fit both grammar and meaning. Cheating "in the exam" (f) is an offence because it (g) "lowers" or "undermines" the standard of education, and (h) "in consequence of" students' failure to (i) "acquire" or "receive" true education, the nation will (j) "suffer" greatly — each choice matches the intended sense and sentence structure.

Explanation:
(a) "era", (b) "ambitious" and (c) "without" fit because "opened a new era" is a common collocation, the bridge is a large-scale (ambitious) project, and "implemented without any foreign aid" is grammatically correct.  
(d) "off" and (e) "in" are correct because areas are "cut off" (phrasal verb) and we say "keep pace with the other parts in economic development."  
(f) "trade" and (g) "communication" work since bridges "expand trade and commerce" and speed up communication/transport.  
(h) "growth", (i) "poverty" and (j) "dream" fit common collocations: "economic growth", "reduce the poverty" and "long‑cherished dream" which "came true."

(c) "however" is appropriate to show contrast between what is true about trees and the fact that many people are unaware.  
(d) "consequently" (or "as a result") is right because it links the action (cutting trees) to its outcome (shrinking forest lands).

(e) I saw a bird flying in the sky. (আমি একটি পাখিকে আকাশে উড়তে দেখলাম।)

Explanation:
(a) If the sky is cloudy, it will probably rain.
Explanation: This is a real conditional about weather, so we use present tense in the if-clause and "will" + base verb in the main clause to show a likely future result.

(b) There are some habits which should be given up.
Explanation: "There are some…" introduces existence, and the relative clause "which should be given up" specifies those habits that ought to be abandoned.

(c) Man is curious by nature.
Explanation: "By nature" is a fixed phrase expressing a general truth about people, so this sentence states a habitual/characteristic quality.

(d) If I had seen him, I would have spoken to him.
Explanation: This is a third conditional (unreal past): "If" + past perfect in the if-clause and "would have" + past participle in the result clause to show an action that did not happen.

(e) I saw a bird flying.
Explanation: Simple past "saw" reports a past observation, and the present participle "flying" describes what the bird was doing at that time.

(c) Walking is a good exercise. (হাঁটা একটি ভালো ব্যায়াম।) (d) His syllabus is incomplete. (তার পাঠ্যসূচি অসম্পূর্ণ।)

(e) Telling a lie is a great sin. (মিথ্যা বলা মহাপাপ।)

Explanation:
(a) If you eat a balanced diet, you will stay healthy.  
This is a first conditional: the if-clause uses present simple ("eat") for a real possibility, and the main clause uses "will" for the result.

(b) If I were invited, I would join the party.  
This is a second conditional for an unreal or unlikely situation: use the past subjunctive ("were") in the if-clause and "would" in the main clause.

(c) Walking is a good exercise.  
"Walking" is a gerund (verb+ing) functioning as a noun and the subject of the sentence.

(d) His syllabus is well designed.  
"Designed" is a past participle used adjectivally (with "well") to describe the syllabus.

(e) Lying is a great sin.  
"Lying" is a gerund naming the action and acting as the subject, which is common when talking about general moral statements.

(a) I feel like__________.

(b) Babies do not know___________.

(c) I saw a beggar___________.

(d) Were I a rich man,____________.

(e) If you do not work hard,___________.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Completing Sentences:

(a) I feel like going for a walk in the evening. (আমার সন্ধ্যায় হাঁটতে ইচ্ছে করছে।)

(b) Babies do not know how to read and write, (শিশুরা পড়তে ও লিখতে জানে না।)

(c) I saw a begger begging on the street, (আমি একজন ভিক্ষুককে রাস্তায় ভিক্ষা করতে দেখলাম।)

(d) Were I a rich man, I would help the poor. (আমি যদি ধনী হতাম তাহলে আমি গরিবদের সাহায্য করতাম।)

(e) If you do not work hard, you cannot shine in life, (তুমি যদি কঠোর পরিশ্রম না করো তবে তুমি জীবনে উন্নতি করতে পারবে না।)

Explanation:
(a) I feel like going for a walk.
Explanation: "Feel like" is followed by a gerund to express a desire or inclination, so "going" (gerund) is correct.

(b) Babies do not know right from wrong.
Explanation: This noun phrase shows that infants haven’t developed moral judgment yet; "do not know" correctly takes the noun phrase "right from wrong."

(c) I saw a beggar sitting by the road.
Explanation: With verbs of perception like "saw," use object + present participle to describe the action you observed ("saw someone sitting").

(d) Were I a rich man, I would travel the world.
Explanation: This is an inverted subjunctive conditional (equivalent to "If I were...") used for hypothetical situations; the main clause uses "would."

(e) If you do not work hard, you will fail the exam.
Explanation: This is a first conditional: present simple in the "if" clause with "will" in the main clause to express a likely future consequence.

Question:
(a) No sooner had we reached the school —.

(b) Unless you study attentively —.

(c) Scarcely had the party begun —.

(d) If I had known his mobile number, —.

(e) Work hard provided that —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) No sooner had we reached the school —.
The correct continuation uses "than" with inversion, e.g. "No sooner had we reached the school than the bell rang." This structure (No sooner + auxiliary + subject + past participle ... than ...) shows one action immediately followed another.

(b) Unless you study attentively —.
"Unless" means "if not," so the main clause normally uses the future: "Unless you study attentively, you will fail the exam." It expresses a negative condition: success depends on studying.

(c) Scarcely had the party begun —.
This pairs with "when" (or "before") and uses inversion, e.g. "Scarcely had the party begun when it started to rain." "Scarcely/hardly ... when" indicates one event happened immediately after another.

(d) If I had known his mobile number, —.
This is a third‑conditional (past unreal): "If I had known his mobile number, I would have called him." Form: If + past perfect, ... would have + past participle (an unreal past result).

(e) Work hard provided that —.
"Provided that" means "on condition that," so complete with a condition: "Work hard provided that you want to succeed." It sets a requirement — you should work hard only if that condition holds (or it explains the reason/condition for the advice).

(b) Shila seemed upset. She talked as if —.

(c) Yesterday we were at our office. Scarcely had we finished our duty —.

(d) We are not free from danger. Danger often comes where —.

(e) Restless life is risky. We have to take rest —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) If I had seen him, I would have told you.
Explanation: This is a past unreal (third) conditional: "If" + past perfect ("had seen") with "would have" + past participle to show a hypothetical past action that did not happen.

(b) She talked as if she were upset.
Explanation: After "as if" to describe an unreal or hypothetical state we use the subjunctive "were" (even with past narration), so "as if she were upset" fits the meaning that she appeared upset.

(c) Scarcely had we finished our duty when the bell rang.
Explanation: "Scarcely... when" shows one action immediately followed another; inversion ("Scarcely had we...") is required after "scarcely" in this structure.

(d) Danger often comes where we least expect it.
Explanation: This is a common idiom meaning danger appears unexpectedly; "where we least expect it" completes the thought naturally and idiomatically.

(e) We have to take rest from time to time.
Explanation: "From time to time" (or "occasionally") expresses the idea of taking periodic rest, which matches the warning that a restless life is risky.

(d) But now she has made a remarkable development in her GDP —.

(e) So, it is our bounden duty to —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "Where there is a will, there is a way." — This proverb means that firm determination leads people to find solutions; if someone truly wants to achieve something, they will overcome obstacles.

(b) "If a man does not work hard, he will not succeed." — Success generally follows effort; without persistent hard work one cannot expect to achieve goals or rewards.

(c) "As the people of Bangladesh are hard-working, the country is developing steadily." — A diligent workforce raises productivity and investment, so collective hard work contributes directly to national development.

(d) "But now she has made a remarkable development in her GDP, indicating significant economic growth." — An increasing GDP reflects higher production, incomes and investment, so a notable GDP rise shows the economy is expanding.

(e) "So, it is our bounden duty to work for the country's progress and safeguard its achievements." — Citizens’ responsibility is to contribute through hard work, honesty and protection of resources so that development is sustained.

(d) If you visit Rajshahi, Bogura and Dinajpur —.

(e) People of this area produce a huge amount of mangoes and —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:

(a) The mango is a fruit which is rich in vitamins. — "which" introduces a relative clause giving more information about "fruit."

(b) It is so delicious that everyone likes it. — "so ... that" expresses a result; "that" introduces the result clause (everyone likes it).

(c) Rajshahi is the place where many mangoes are grown. — "where" links the noun "place" to a clause describing what happens in that place (in which many mangoes are grown).

(d) If you visit Rajshahi, Bogura and Dinajpur, you will see large mango orchards. — A real conditional: present tense in the "if" clause plus "will" in the main clause shows a likely future result.

(e) People of this area produce a huge amount of mangoes and export them. — "and" connects two related actions (producing and exporting) to complete the idea.

(c) If a student wants to do well in English —.

(d) Unless he/she practices it, —.

(e) It is high time —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) It is English which can help us for global communication .

(b) But most of the students don't know how to learn English .

(c) If a student wants to do well in English s/he has to practise it .

(d) Unless s/he practises it, it will be difficult for her/him to learn it .

(e) It is high time we had a sound knowledge of English .

Explanation:
(a) This is a cleft construction where "which" introduces a relative clause referring back to "English"; complete it with a clause like "which I enjoy most" so the relative pronoun has a verb and object.  
(b) After "how" use an indirect-question or an infinitival phrase: e.g., "how to study" or "how they can improve"; for instructions prefer "how to + base verb."  
(c) This begins a first‑conditional idea: use "If + present simple, ... will/should/can + base verb" (e.g., "If a student wants to do well in English, he/she should practise regularly").  
(d) "Unless" means "if not," so follow it with present simple and a result clause (often future): e.g., "Unless he/she practices it, he/she won't improve."  
(e) After "It is high time" use a past tense/subjunctive to show something should already happen: e.g., "It is high time you started working harder."

(c) Time is so valuable that — .

(d) Those who — cannot shine in life.

(e) —, you must be successful.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) There goes a proverb that time and tide wait for none .

(b) Though lost wealth can be regained by hard work, lost time can never be regained .

(c) Time is so valuable that we should not waste it .

(d) Those who idle away their time , cannot shine in life.

(e) If you make the best use of time , you must be successful.

Explanation:
(a) "There goes a proverb that time and tide wait for none" — This proverb is correct because time moves on regardless of our wishes; it teaches that we must act promptly since opportunities do not pause.

(b) "Though lost wealth can be regained by hard work, lost time cannot be regained" — Time is irreversible, so once it is gone it cannot be recovered, which is why we should value and use it wisely.

(c) "Time is so valuable that we must not waste a single moment" — This emphasizes that every moment has potential value for work or learning, so wasting time reduces our chances of progress.

(d) "Those who waste time cannot shine in life" — Habitual procrastination or idleness prevents steady effort and skill-building, so such people miss the consistent work needed for success.

(e) "Use your time well, and you must be successful" — Good time management increases productivity and creates opportunities, making success far more likely.

(e) On the other hand, if we remain lazy —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) It is said that youth is the best part of our life .

(b) In youth the mind is so soft that we can shape it according to our wish .

(c) If we lose the morning hours of life, we can't reach the goal of life .

(d) We will reap good harvest if we sow the good seeds with proper nursing .

(e) On the other hand, if we remain lazy, we must suffer in the long run .

Explanation:
(a) The correct completion is a proverb about early rising and disciplined habits: it says that regular, orderly routines (like rising early) promote health, efficiency and success. This is right because habits formed by discipline produce better physical and mental results over time.

(b) The right idea is that a young mind is pliable and easily shaped by teaching and example. That’s why education and good influence in youth have a lasting effect on character and behaviour.

(c) The sentence means that once the early, most productive years are wasted they cannot be recovered. It’s correct because time is irreversible, so losing youthful opportunities reduces future potential.

(d) This completes the cause–effect idea: if we sow good work or habits, we will reap a good harvest (good results). It’s true because effort and wise choices tend to produce corresponding positive outcomes.

(e) The contrast shows that laziness brings failure or loss of opportunities. This is right because inactivity and neglect prevent progress, so one cannot expect good results without effort.

(c) Though cricket is a costly game, it is played all over the world .

(d) Bangladesh is a test playing country but its standard is not so high .

(e) Our players are trying hard to upgrade the standard.

Explanation:
(a) "Cricket is a game of skill."  
It requires batting, bowling, fielding techniques and tactical judgment, so "of skill" correctly describes its nature.

(b) "Boys and girls of our country play cricket."  
Cricket is very popular among both boys and girls in schools and communities, so "play cricket" completes the idea.

(c) "Though cricket is a costly game, many people play it."  
Despite the expense of formal equipment, informal street or backyard cricket and strong popularity lead many people to play.

(d) "Bangladesh is a test playing country now."  
Bangladesh gained Test status (in 2000) and participates in Test matches, so "now" correctly indicates its current status.

(e) "Steps should be taken to upgrade the standard."  
To raise the level of cricket, planned actions like better coaching, facilities and training are needed, so "steps should be taken" fits.

(c) Drive fast/Hurry up/Walk fast/Run fast . lest you should miss the plane.

(d) Danger often comes where it is leared.

(e) The lady speaks as if she knew everything well .

Explanation:
(a) Five years have passed since I left school.  
Explanation: With a present-perfect time span like "have passed," "since" introduces a point in the past, so we use simple past ("I left") to mark the starting point.

(b) Hardly had the assembly begun when the principal arrived.  
Explanation: "Hardly" requires inversion with the past perfect ("had begun" — past participle), and "when" links the shortly following event.

(c) Leave early, lest you should miss the plane.  
Explanation: "Lest" expresses prevention and is followed formally by "should" + base verb ("should miss") to show what to avoid.

(d) Danger often comes when we least expect it.  
Explanation: "When we least expect it" is the correct adverbial time clause meaning danger arrives at unexpected moments.

(e) The lady speaks as if she were an expert.  
Explanation: "As if" with an unreal or hypothetical idea takes the subjunctive ("were") to show she is not actually an expert.

(d) We love and help one another as if we were brothers .

(e) We work seriously in order that Bangladesh can prosper day by day .

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) The blank needs a relative clause of place introduced by "where" (e.g. "This is Bangladesh where I was born") because "Bangladesh" is a place.  
(b) "Though" shows contrast, so it should be followed by a contrasting fact or clause (e.g. "though many are poor" or "though not wealthy").  
(c) This is a general truth, so use the simple present with the plural subject "others" (e.g. "others help him/her").  
(d) "As if" makes a comparison and for an unreal or emphatic comparison we use the subjunctive/past form: "as if we were brothers."  
(e) "In order that" expresses purpose and is usually followed by "may/might" + verb (e.g. "in order that Bangladesh may prosper").

(b) It is high time —.

(c) Walk slowly lest —.

(d) — cannot succeed.

(e) Had I seen you before —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) He pretends as if he were mad .

(b) It is high time we did the task .

(c) Walk slowly lest you should/might fall down .

(d) Those who are idle , cannot succeed.

(e) Had I seen you before, I would have given you some money .

Explanation:
a After "as if" we use a past tense (or past perfect) to show something is unreal or contrary to fact, e.g. "He pretends as if he knew everything" — the past form "knew" shows the pretence, not reality.

b "It is high time" is followed by a past simple to express that something should happen now, e.g. "It is high time you went" — the past verb "went" functions like a subjunctive expressing present necessity.

c "Lest" introduces a negative purpose and takes a subjunctive or "should" form, e.g. "Walk slowly lest you fall" (or "lest you should fall") — it warns against an expected undesirable outcome.

d Use a negative pronoun with a positive auxiliary to avoid a double negative, e.g. "No one can succeed" (not "No one cannot succeed"); "cannot" pairs with an affirmative subject like "he" or "they."

e "Had I seen you before" uses inversion for the third conditional; it means "If I had seen you before, I would have told you," so the inverted "Had I..." replaces "If I had..." to show the unreal past condition.

Question:
(a) Smoking is a habit which —.

(b) Many people go on smoking though —.

(c) —, we will suffer a lot.

(d) People can’t give up smoking easily because —.

(e) So attempts must be taken by us to —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Smoking is a habit which is harmful to health/causes fatal diseases .

(b) Many people go on smoking though they know its adverse effect/it is dangerous .

(c) If we do not give up smoking , we will suffer a lot.

(d) People cannot give up smoking easily because they become addicted to it .

(e) So attempts must be taken by us to avoid smoking so that we can keep fit .

Explanation:
(a) The correct completion is "is injurious to health" because the relative clause introduced by "which" should describe the habit; smoking damages lungs and causes serious diseases. 

(b) "Many people go on smoking though it is harmful/addictive" fits because despite knowing the harm, social pressures and addiction make them continue. 

(c) "If we smoke, we will suffer a lot" shows the direct consequence: continued smoking leads to health problems and suffering. 

(d) "People can’t give up smoking easily because it is addictive" is right since nicotine creates physical and psychological dependence that makes quitting hard. 

(e) "So attempts must be taken by us to discourage smoking / help people quit" is appropriate because prevention, awareness and support are needed to reduce smoking and its harm.

(c) Had he been a little careful he could have avoided the accident .

(d) They were frightened when the earthquake had struck .

(e) Take your umbrella lest it should rain .

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক "'because' কারণ বোঝায়, তাই বাক্যের শেষ অংশে আঘাতের কারণ বলা উচিত; উদাহরণ: 'Acid rain is harmful because it damages plants, corrodes buildings and harms aquatic life.' এটি কারণ‑বর্ণনা দেয়, তাই সঠিক।  

খ "'so ... that' ফল‑প্রকাশ করে: প্রথম অংশে মাত্রা/পরিমাণ এবং পরে 'that' দিয়ে তার ফল বলা হয়; উদাহরণ: 'The wind was so strong that it blew the roof off.'  

গ "Had he been a little careful ..." হল অতীতের আনরিয়াল শর্ত (inversion of 'if he had...') যা অতীতের ভিন্ন ফলাফল ধরে; পূরণ হবে: '...he would not have made that mistake.'  

ঘ "They were frightened when ..."‑এ 'when' সময়/ঘটনা জানায় যা ভয়ের কারণ; উদাহরণ: 'They were frightened when they saw the snake.' এটি কারণ ও সময় সঠিকভাবে সংযুক্ত করে।  

ঙ "Take your umbrella lest ..."‑এ 'lest' নেগেটিভ উদ্দেশ্য বা সতর্কতা বোঝায় (মানে 'so that ... not'); সাধারণ পূরণ: 'Take your umbrella lest you get wet' বা পুরানো রীতি মতে 'lest you should get wet.'

(c) Hardly had he started for school when the rain started .

(d) He told me that honesty is the best policy .

(e) Where there is a will , there is a way.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক He asked me where I was going. — প্রতিবেদিত প্রশ্নে প্রশ্নবোধক শব্দ (where) রাখা হয় কিন্তু বাক্যক্রম সাধারণ অর্থাৎ subject + verb হয় এবং tense অনুসারে পরিবর্তিত হয় (go → was going).

খ He showed me how it can be done. — 'how' দিয়ে শুরু হওয়া clause টি একধরণের object-clause, তাই 'how + subject + modal/verb' ক্রম বজায় থাকে এবং এটি কাজটি কীভাবে করা যায় তা বোঝায়।

গ Hardly had he started for school when it began to rain. — 'Hardly/Scarcely … when' конструкশনে inversion (Had he started) লাগে এবং এরপর সাধারণত 'when' দিয়ে দ্বিতীয় ঘটনা শুরু হয় (began to rain)।

ঘ He told me that he would come the next day. — সরাসরি বক্তব্য প্রতিবেদন করলে 'that' দিয়ে clause আসে এবং সময়/কাল backshift হয় (will → would, today → the next day)।

ঙ I wonder if there is a way. — প্রশ্নবোধক হ্যাঁ/না ধরনের ভাব প্রতিবেদন করতে 'if/whether' ব্যবহার করা হয় এবং বাক্যক্রম সরল থাকে (if + subject + verb)।

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) We come to know about the happenings of home and abroad if we read newspaper .

(b) People read newspaper lest they should miss the latest news .

(c) Many students do not read newspaper regularly as they are busy with their study/they are not aware of the importance of reading newspaper .

(d) Many people earn their living by selling newspapers .

(e) I become happy when I get good news .

Explanation:
(a) if we read newspapers. Newspapers report important events at home and abroad, so reading them keeps us informed about current affairs.

(b) lest they remain ignorant. "Lest" means to prevent something, so people read newspapers to avoid being uninformed about important news.

(c) as they are too busy with studies or lack the habit. Many students prioritize academic work or have little time or interest, so they don’t read newspapers regularly.

(d) by working in the newspaper industry (as journalists, printers, vendors, etc.). The newspaper business provides various jobs—reporting, editing, printing and selling—that people depend on for income.

(e) when I read good news. Positive or favorable news gives pleasure and relief, so reading good news naturally makes one happy.

(c) He can't cut a good figure in the exam because he is not attentive to study.

(d) Be truthful if you want to be successful in life .

(e) His silence proves that he agrees to do this work .

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক 1971 হল সেই সাল যখন বাংলাদেশ স্বাধীনতা অর্জন করে; এটি ঐতিহাসিকভাবে সঠিক কারণ 1971 সালের স্বাধীনতা-যুদ্ধের মাধ্যমে দেশটি পাকিস্তান থেকে মুক্তি পায়।  

খ যদিও বাংলাদেশের প্রাকৃতিক সম্পদ সীমিত, তবু দেশের মানবসম্পদ (জনশক্তি), কৃষি ও উদ্যোগ তাকে উন্নয়নে সহায়তা করে; তাই সীমিত প্রাকৃতিক সম্পদের পরেও অগ্রগতি সম্ভব।  

গ সে ফেল করেছে কারণ সে পড়াশোনায় মনোযোগী নয়—এখানে 'because' একটি কারণ-ব্যাখ্যার শব্দ যা ফল (ফেল) ও কারণ (মনোযোগী না হওয়া) যোগ করে।  

ঘ সততা বজায় রাখো যদি তুমি বিশ্বাস বা সম্মান পেতে চাও; 'if' শর্ত বোঝায়—বিশ্বাস পাওয়ার শর্ত হিসেবে সত্য बोलাকে নির্দেশ করে।  

ঙ তার নীরবতা প্রমাণ করে যে সে সম্মত; সাধারণ বিবেচনায় নীরবতা অনেক সময় সম্মতি বোঝায় ("silence implies consent")।

(d) On the way to school, I walked fast lest I should miss the class .

(e) If I reached late, my class teacher would punish me .

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক "because" একটি কারণ দেখায়, তাই বাক্যের প্রধান ক্রিয়ার সঙ্গে সময় মিল রেখে কারণটি অতীত কালেই দিতে হবে (উদাহরণ: "because my alarm didn't ring" বা "কারণ আমি বেশি ঘুমিয়ে ছিলাম")।

খ "As soon as" দুটি কাজের তাত্ক্ষণিক ক্রম প্রকাশ করে; তাই উভয় ক্রিয়াই সাধারণত অতীত কালেই থাকে (উদাহরণ: "As soon as I got up from bed, I brushed my teeth")।

গ "Since" কারণ নির্দেশ করে; কারণবাচক ক্লজের পরে ফলাফল দিতেই হবে এবং সময়一致 রাখতে উভয় ক্লজের কাল মিলতে হবে (উদাহরণ: "Since I could not avail the bus, I walked to school")।

ঘ "lest" নেতিবাচক উদ্দেশ্য প্রকাশ করে—কিছু ঘটাবার প্রতিরোধে—এবং পরে প্রায়শই subjunctive বা "should" আসে (উদাহরণ: "I walked fast lest I should be late")।

ঙ "If I reached late" একটি শর্তমূলক বাক্য শুরু করে; বাস্তব বা অভ্যাসজনিত গত প্রেক্ষাপটে ফলাফল দেখাতে প্রধান ক্লজে অতীতকাল বা "would/used to" ব্যবহার করা হয় (উদাহরণ: "If I reached late, the teacher would scold me" বা অভ্যাসে "If I reached late, the teacher used to scold me")।

(b) It is a matter of sorrow that------.

(c) I tried to write to you but------.

(d) In fact, we all are always------.

(e) We hope that we-----.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Five years have passed since we met last .

(b) It is a matter of sorrow that you do not utilize your time .

(c) I tried to write to you but failed due to my tight schedule .

(d) In fact, we all are always gifted with Almighty's blessings .

(e) We hope that we will succeed in the exam .

Explanation:
(a) "Five years have passed since I last saw him." — Present perfect ([math]have\ passed[/math]) is used to show time elapsed up to now, and "since" introduces the past point ("I last saw him").

(b) "It is a matter of sorrow that he died." — The structure "It is a matter of sorrow that + clause" introduces a regretful fact; the clause after "that" reports the sorrowful event in the appropriate tense.

(c) "I tried to write to you but I couldn't." — "Tried" (past) shows an attempt, and "but" contrasts it with the result; a negative like "couldn't" or "was unable to" completes the idea of failure.

(d) "In fact, we all are always learning." — "Are always" + present participle expresses a continued or habitual action; this structure emphasizes that learning is ongoing.

(e) "We hope that we will succeed." — "Hope" expresses a desire about the future, so it is natural to use "that" plus a future tense ("we will succeed") to state the expected outcome.

(c) If we cut trees at random, —.

(d) Trees supply oxygen —.

(e) Since trees help us in many ways —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Many people cut trees as they do not know their importance .

(b) Trees cause rainfall which is needed for our cultivation/is essential for our agriculture .

(c) If we cut trees at random, one day our country will turn into a desert/one day there will be no trees left .

(d) Trees supply oxygen which we take in.

(e) Since trees help us in many ways, we should plant more and more trees .

Explanation:
(a) Many people cut trees for timber, fuel and to clear land. This completion shows purpose — the sentence needs a phrase explaining why people cut trees.

(b) Trees cause rainfall which helps maintain soil moisture and supports agriculture. The relative clause introduced by "which" should describe the beneficial effect of that rainfall.

(c) If we cut trees at random, soil erosion and floods will increase. This is a cause–effect conditional: removing trees causes loss of root binding, so erosion and flooding follow.

(d) Trees supply oxygen essential for human and animal life. This states a factual result of photosynthesis, so the completion should name the life-supporting role of oxygen.

(e) Since trees help us in many ways, we must protect and plant more of them. The sentence gives a reason, so the natural completion is a conclusion or recommendation based on that reason.

Explanation:
ক ফুল ভালোবাসা, সৌন্দর্য ও পবিত্রতার প্রতীক হওয়ায় মানুষের চোখে তা বিশেষ সুন্দর ও প্রশংসনীয়—তাই এটি সকলের কাছে আকর্ষণীয় বা প্রশংসিত।

খ প্রায় সবাই ফুল পছন্দ করে; তাই বলা হয় যে কমই এমন মানুষ আছে যিনি ফুল পছন্দ করেন না—এটি সাধারণ মানুষের স্বভাবগত রুচি নির্দেশ করে।

গ শত্রুকে বন্ধু করা যায় যদি আমরা সদয়তা, ক্ষমা বা মমত্ব প্রদর্শন করি; ভালো আচরণ অন্যের মন বদলে দিতে সাহায্য করে।

ঙ অনেকেই ফুল চাষ করে কারণ ফুল পরিবেশ সুন্দর করে, খুশি দেয় এবং ব্যবসায়িক বা আয়-উৎস হিসেবে কার্যকর—এই কারণে ফুলের চাহিদা ও গুরুত্ব বেশি।

(c) — I were a child.

(d) United we stand, —.

(e) The boy is so weak in mathematics —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) If you do not waste your time, you will shine in life .

(b) This is the boy who secured the first place in the exam .

(c) I wish I were a child.

(d) United we stand, divided we fall .

(e) The boy is so weak in mathematics that he can never pass in it in the exams .

Explanation:
(a) "If you do not waste time, you will succeed." — This is a first conditional: the if-clause uses the present simple and the main clause uses "will" to show a likely future result.

(b) "This is the boy who helped me." — Use "who" for people when the relative clause is the subject (he helped), so "who" correctly introduces the clause.

(c) "If only I were a child." — "If only" expresses a wish about an unreal present situation; the subjunctive "were" is used after wishes (not "was").

(d) "United we stand, divided we fall." — This is a fixed proverb showing contrast; "divided we fall" completes the balanced antithesis to "united we stand."

(e) "The boy is so weak in mathematics that he cannot solve the problem." — The "so... that" pattern links degree to result: his weakness is the cause and the inability to solve the problem is the result.

(c) It is hard labour that —-

(d) The idle cannot reach their target because —-

(e) —- unless you work hard.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) We must work hard in order that we can succeed in life .

(b) A man who wastes time in idleness , cannot shine in life.

(c) It is hard labour that helps a man to reach his goal .

(d) The idle cannot reach their target because they waste their valuable time .

(e) You will suffer in the long run unless you work hard.

Explanation:
(a) We must work hard in order that we may succeed.
Explanation: "In order that" expresses purpose and is followed by a clause showing the intended result; "may succeed" correctly shows the goal of working hard.

(b) A man who does not work hard cannot shine in life.
Explanation: The relative clause "who does not work hard" defines the kind of man, and the negative shows the consequence that he cannot succeed or "shine."

(c) It is hard labour that brings success.
Explanation: This cleft sentence ("It is ... that") emphasizes the cause; it shows that hard labour is the key factor producing success.

(d) The idle cannot reach their target because they do not work hard.
Explanation: "Because" gives the reason — idleness (not working hard) is the cause of failing to reach targets.

(e) Nothing can be achieved unless you work hard.
Explanation: "Unless" means "if not," so this conditional states that without hard work, achievement is impossible.

খ “As soon as” সময় নির্দেশ করে এবং সঙ্গে সঙ্গে ঘটা ক্রিয়ার কথা বলে, তাই সাধারণত সরাসরি অতীত কালের ক্রিয়া লাগে — উদাহরণ: “I brushed my teeth” বা “I had my breakfast.” 

গ এখানে “As I could not hire a rickshaw” কারণ দেখায়, ফলে ফলাফল শুদ্ধভাবে অতীতে বলা হবে, যেমন “I had to walk to school” বা “I walked to school.”

ঙ “If I reached late” হলে ফলাফল দুইভাবে লেখা যায়: যদি সাধারণ অতীত অভিজ্ঞতা বোঝাতে চান তবে ফলাফলও অতীতে রাখবেন (“my teacher scolded me”); যদি সম্ভাব্য পরিণতি বোঝাতে চান তবে শর্তাধীন ফলাফল gebruikt=”would” (“I would be punished”).

Explanation: "Unless" introduces the negative condition (if you are not united); the result clause states the consequence of that condition.

(d) Who does not know this wise saying?  
Explanation: This rhetorical question uses the negative form to imply that the saying is very well known; "Who doesn't know...?" is a common idiom.

(e) The story of the old man and his sons teaches us that unity is strength.  
Explanation: The tale shows that individual sticks are weak but together they are strong, so its moral is that unity brings strength.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
(a) No sooner had I reached home than-------.

(b) He was so lazy that-------.

(c) It is health which-------.

(d) He succeeded though-------.

(e) As our elders love us,---------.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) No sooner had I reached home than it started raining .

(b) He was so lazy that he could not finish the job in time .

(c) It is health which is wealth .

(d) He succeeded though he did not work hard .

(e) As our elders love us, we should obey them .

Explanation:
(a) No sooner had I reached home than it began to rain.
Explanation: "No sooner ... than" shows that one event happened immediately after another and requires inversion (auxiliary before subject) in the first clause.

(b) He was so lazy that he did not finish his work.
Explanation: "So ... that" expresses a cause–result relationship: the adjective "lazy" is the cause and the clause after "that" gives the consequence.

(c) It is health which makes life worth living.
Explanation: This is a cleft/relative structure emphasizing "health"; "which" introduces the clause that describes the role or importance of health.

(d) He succeeded though he had little experience.
Explanation: "Though" introduces a concession meaning "in spite of"; it contrasts the unexpected success with the limiting condition.

(e) As our elders love us, we should respect them.
Explanation: "As" gives a reason (because), so the main clause expresses the appropriate response or consequence to that reason.

Type: CQ | Book: English 2nd Paper | Years: 2015 | Boards:  | Tags: Cumilla Board
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
(a) ------- if he told me.

(b) The answer that he ------.

(c) Finishing the work,------.

(d) I saw my mother------.

(e) To walk in the morning------.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) would be present there if he told me.

(b) The answer that he gave me was not satisfactory .

(c) Finishing the work, I went to market .

(d) I saw my mother cooking food in the kitchen .

(e) To walk in the morning is good for health .

Explanation:
(a) "I would help him if he told me." — This is a second conditional: the if-clause uses past simple "told" to show a hypothetical situation, so the main clause uses "would" + base verb ("would help").

(b) "The answer that he gave." — The relative clause uses past simple "gave" because it refers to a completed action in the past.

(c) "Finishing the work, he went home." — A participle clause ("Finishing the work") shows an action done just before the main action; the subject of the participle is the same as the subject of the main clause ("he").

(d) "I saw my mother crossing the road." — After perception verbs you can use "object + -ing" to show an ongoing action; you can also say "I saw my mother cross the road" (bare infinitive) to mean you witnessed the whole action.

(e) "To walk in the morning is healthy." — An infinitive phrase acts as the subject here, so it takes a singular verb ("is") and expresses a general truth or habit.

(h) No other person among us is as happy as a simple man. (Superlative)

(i) Everybody should like simplicity. (Imperative)

(j) So, a simple life should be led by all. (Active)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Changing Sentences:

(a) What a virtue simplicity is! (সরলতা কী যে এক গুণ!)

(b) There is nobody but appreciates this quality. (এমন কেউ নেই যে এই গুণের প্রশংসা করে না।)

Or, There is nobody who does not appreciate this quality. (অথবা, এমন কেউ নেই যে এই গুণের প্রশংসা করে না।)

(c) Very few qualities are as good as it. (খুব কম গুণই এর মতো ভালো।)

(d) This virtue should be practised. (এই গুণের অনুশীলন করা উচিত।)

(e) A simple man is happier than most other men. (একজন সরল মানুষ অন্য অধিকাংশ মানুষের চেয়ে বেশি সুখী।)

(f) Without practising simplicity, none can earn people's favour. (সরলতার চর্চা না করে কেউই মানুষের অনুগ্রহ অর্জন করতে পারে না।)

(g) What a carefree life a simple man leads! (একজন সরল মানুষ কতই না দুশ্চিন্তামুক্ত জীবনযাপন করে।)

(h) A simple man is the happiest person among us. (একজন সরল মানুষ আমাদের মধ্যে সবচেয়ে সুখী ব্যক্তি।)

(i) Let everybody like simplicity. (সবাই সরলতা পছন্দ করুক।)

(j) So, all should lead a simple life. (তাই, সকলের উচিত সরল জীবনযাপন করা।)

Explanation:
(a) What a great virtue simplicity is!
Explanation: Exclamatory sentences use "What" (noun phrase + subject + verb) to express strong feeling; here the structure emphasizes the praise of simplicity.

(b) Nobody fails to appreciate this quality.
Explanation: To convert to a negative without changing the meaning, use "nobody fails to…" which keeps the original affirmative sense that all appreciate it.

(c) It is a very good quality.
Explanation: Changing from superlative ("one of the best") to the positive degree removes comparison; "very good" gives the plain positive form.

(d) This virtue should be practised.
Explanation: Passive voice with a modal uses "should be" + past participle, so the object ("this virtue") becomes the subject of the passive sentence.

(e) A simple man is happier than most men.
Explanation: Comparative degree uses "happier than" to compare two groups; this conveys the same idea as "very few men are as happy as…".

(f) By practising simplicity one cannot fail to earn people's favour.
Explanation: Using "cannot fail to" is a negative form that preserves the original meaning (that practising simplicity will certainly earn favour).

(g) What a very carefree life a simple man leads!
Explanation: Exclamatory form with "What" + noun phrase + subject + verb expresses surprise or strong feeling about the carefree life.

(h) A simple man is the happiest person among us.
Explanation: Superlative uses "the + adjective + noun" to show the highest degree of happiness within the group.

(i) Let everyone like simplicity.
Explanation: Imperative for a general command or wish uses "Let" + object (everyone) + base verb to address all persons.

(j) So, everyone should lead a simple life.
Explanation: Active voice makes "everyone" the subject performing the action; it changes "should be led by all" into the corresponding active form.

Question:
(a) Bangladesh is a low-lying country. (Change it into Interrogative)

(b) Every year natural disasters visit us. (Change it into passive voice)

(c) Who does not know the consequence of Tsunami? (Change it into Assertive sentence)

(d) The recent flood was very devastating. (Change it into Exclamatory sentence) 

(e) Dhaka is the most risky city in the earthquake zone. (Change it into positive degree)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Isn't Bangladesh a low-lying country?

(b) We are visited by natural disasters every year.

(c) Everyone/Everybody knows the consequence of Tsunami.

Or, All know the consequence of Tsunami.

(d) How devastating the recent food was!

(e) No other city is as risky as Dhaka in the earthquake zone.

Or, No other city in the earthquake zone is as risky as Dhaka.

Explanation:
(a) "Is Bangladesh a low-lying country?"  
To form an interrogative in present simple, invert the auxiliary verb "is" and the subject "Bangladesh."

(b) "Every year we are visited by natural disasters."  
In passive voice the object "us" becomes the subject "we" and the active verb "visit" becomes "are visited" to match present simple tense.

(c) "Everyone knows the consequences of a tsunami."  
An assertive sentence states the idea directly; replace the interrogative "Who does not know..." with the universal affirmative "Everyone knows..."

(d) "How devastating the recent flood was!"  
For exclamation with an adjective use "How + adjective + subject + verb" to show strong feeling about how devastating the flood was.

(e) "Dhaka is a risky city in the earthquake zone."  
Change the superlative "the most risky" to the positive degree "risky"; the sentence then simply states the quality without comparison.

(b) In fact, it is a blessing of science. (Make it negative without changing the original meaning.)

(c) It has facilitated the world very greatly. (Make it exclamatory)

(d) Moreover, it has lessened our workloads. (Make it passive)

(e) So, we should use it in our everyday life. (Make it imperative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Very few inventions of modern science are as great as computer.

(b) In fact, it is not a curse of science.

(c) How greatly it has facilitated the world!

(d) Moreover, our workloads have been lessened by it.

(e) So, let us use it in our everyday life.

Explanation:
ক The computer is one of the greatest inventions of modern science. Explanation: The sentence is already positive (affirmative); adding "The" makes it grammatically complete and natural.

খ In fact, it is not a curse of science. Explanation: A negative form using the antonym "curse" preserves the original positive meaning by denying the opposite.

গ How greatly it has facilitated the world! Explanation: An exclamatory sentence uses "How" + subject + verb to express strong feeling about the degree of facilitation.

ঘ Moreover, our workloads have been lessened by the computer. Explanation: In passive voice the object ("our workloads") becomes the subject and the verb changes to "have been lessened," with the agent introduced by "by."

ঙ Use it in your everyday life. Explanation: An imperative sentence gives a direct command; the subject "you" is omitted and the verb starts the sentence.

Question:
(a) Very few conquerors of the world were so great as Taimur. (Superlative)

(b) The province of a powerful prince was once attacked by young Taimur. (Active)

(c) He captured a large village. (Passive)

(d) The army killed Taimur's all soldires. (Negative)

(e) He did not disguise himself as a rich traveller to survive. (Affirmative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Taimur was one of the greatest conquerors of the world.

(b) Once young Taimur attacked the provinces of a powerful prince.

(c) A large village was captured by him.

(d) The army did not leave Taimur's any soldiers.

Or, No soldier of Taimur could escape being killed by the army.

(e) He disguised himself as a poor traveler to survive.

Explanation:
(a) "Taimur was one of the greatest conquerors of the world." — এখানে অর্থটি বোঝাতে আমরা "one of the + plural superlative (greatest)" ব্যবহার করি, কারণ বাক্যটি বলে যে খুব কম জয়ী তার সমান।

(b) "Young Taimur once attacked the province of a powerful prince." — passive থেকে active তে রূপান্তর করতে করেছে যিনি কাজটি করেছেন (Taimur) তাকে subject করে verb‑টাইম একই রেখে বাক্য সাজানো হয়েছে।

(c) "A large village was captured by him." (বা "A large village was captured by Taimur.") — passive বানাতে object‑কে subject করা হয় এবং মূল verb কে past participle দিয়ে "was + past participle" ব্যবহার করা হয়।

(d) "The army did not kill all of Taimur's soldiers." — negative past simple গঠনের জন্য "did not" + base verb (kill) ব্যবহার করা হয়; এছাড়া "soldires" → "soldiers" এবং "all of" সঠিক ক্রমানুসারে বসানো হয়েছে।

(e) "He disguised himself as a rich traveller to survive." — affirmative তৈরি করতে "not" সরিয়ে দিয়েছেন এবং past simple form "disguised" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।

Question:
(a) Only you can do the work. (Negative)

(b) No other friend is as great as books. (Superlative)

(c) The rose is a very nice flower. (Exclamatory)

(d) We should be patriots. (Imperative)

(e) He called it laurel. (Passive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) None but you can do the work.

(b) Books are the greatest friend.

(c) What a nice flower the rose is!

(d) Let us be patriots.

(e) It was called laurel by him.

Explanation:
(a) Only you can do the work. (Negative)  
The word "only" excludes all others and gives the sentence a negative sense equivalent to "No one else can do the work," so it functions as a negative (restrictive) form.

(b) No other friend is as great as books. (Superlative)  
"No other" plus the comparison shows that none equals books, implying books are the greatest among friends, so the sentence conveys a superlative idea.

(c) The rose is a very nice flower. (Exclamatory)  
When expressed with strong feeling or an exclamation intonation (or recast as "What a very nice flower the rose is!"), the sentence becomes exclamatory because it emphasizes admiration.

(d) We should be patriots. (Imperative)  
Although it uses "should," the sentence gives a moral instruction or urging to a group (hortatory sense), so it functions as an imperative/advisory sentence.

(e) He called it laurel. (Passive)  
To make this passive you promote the object to subject: "It was called laurel by him." The sentence can therefore be expressed in passive voice by using "be" + past participle.

(d) It's not a small project.

(e) Let us go to visit it.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক The construction of the Padma Bridge has almost been completed by the government. Passive করতে কৃতকারক (the government) কে "by" নিয়ে বাক্যের শেষে রাখা হয় এবং মূল বাক্যের অবজেক্ট (the construction) কে সাবজেক্ট করা হয়; টেন্স অর্থাৎ present perfect রাখতে "has been completed" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে এবং "almost" যথাযথভাবে "been"–এর আগে রাখা হয়েছে। 

খ This bridge is larger than any other bridge in Bangladesh. Comparative degree এ তুলনা দেখাতে "larger than" ব্যবহৃত হয়—superlative "largest" বদলে comparative দিয়ে দুটি বা ততোধিক বস্তুর মধ্যে তুলনা করা হয়। 

গ How happy the countrymen will be when it is opened for use! Exclamatory sentence তৈরিতে "How + adjective + subject + verb" প্যাটার্ন ব্যবহার করা হয়; পাশাপাশি "when it is opened"—এখানে ভবিষ্যৎকলের জন্য "will" পুনরাবৃত্তি দরকার নেই। 

ঘ It is not a mega project. Negative বানাতে "is" এর পরে "not" যোগ করা হয়ে বাক্যকে নেগেটিভ করা হয়। 

ঙ Let's visit it. Imperative বা আদেশ/পরামর্শ জানাতে প্রথমপদে "Let's" (let us) ব্যবহার করলে "আমরা যাই"—ধরনের অনুরোধ/আদেশ প্রকাশ পায়; সংক্ষিপ্ত করে "Let's visit it." বলা যায়۔

(c) Their sacrifice is greater than any other thing. (Positive)

(d) By taking proper steps, we can improve their condition. (Negative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) We consider the freedom fighters to be the real heroes of our country.

(b) Their contribution will always be remembered.

(c) No other thing/ Nothing is as great as their sacrifice.

(d) Without taking proper steps, we cannot improve their condition.

(e) Proper respect must be showed to them.

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) Active: Change the passive verb phrase "are considered to be" into an active clause with an agent: "People consider the freedom fighters the real heroes of our country." The subject of the passive becomes the object and a doer (people) is added.

(b) Affirmative: Replace the negative idea "will never be forgotten" with an affirmative equivalent: "People will always remember their contribution." "Never forgotten" ↔ "always remembered" changes negation to affirmation.

(c) Positive: Turn the comparative "is greater than any other thing" into the positive degree: "Their sacrifice is great." This removes the comparative structure and uses the base adjective.

(d) Negative: Introduce negation using an auxiliary or a clause like "unless": "Unless proper steps are taken, we cannot improve their condition." The negative is formed by "cannot" (or by adding "not") and/or by using "unless."

(e) Passive: Make the object the subject and keep the modal verb "must": "They must be shown proper respect." The original object ("them") becomes the subject of the passive and "must" remains with the past participle.

খ সক্রিয় (active) বাচ্য হলে বিষয়টি কাজ করে; passive "is appreciated" কে active করে বানালে হবে "People always appreciate this noble virtue." — এখানে subject (people) কাজটি করছে, তাই active।  

গ নেতিবাচক (negative) বাক্যে না/কেনই বা বিরোধী অংশ থাকে; "Honesty can open..." এর নেতিবাচক হবে "Honesty cannot open a door of peace before a person." — এখানে "cannot" যোগ হওয়ায় বাক্যটি নেগেটিভ হয়ে গেছে।  

ঘ উত্সাহসূচক (exclamatory) বাক্য অনুভূতি প্রকাশ করে এবং বিস্ময়চিহ্ন (!) দিয়ে শেষ হয়; উদাহরণ: "What a very important virtue honesty is!" — এর ভাষা শক্তভাবে অনুভূতি প্রকাশ করছে, তাই exclamatory।  

ঙ অনুদের (imperative) বাক্য আদেশ বা নির্দেশ দেয় এবং সাধারণত ক্রিয়াপদ দিয়ে শুরু হয়; "Never be dishonest." এভাবে সরাসরি নির্দেশ থাকার কারণে এটি imperative।

(a) Once upon a time there was a little girl and her name was Tarin.

(b) In spite of being a nice little girl, she was not an ordinary child.

(c) Didn't she pass her time in reading and writing?

d) Her parents did not dislike her at all.

e) She was praised by everyone.

f) How attentive she was to her study!

g) She also helped her mother when she was free.

h) Did she ever told a lie?

(i) Very few girls in the school were as intelligent as she.

j) She worked hard so that she could shine in life.

Explanation:
Explanation:
a This is a simple (declarative) sentence because it contains one independent clause; "Once upon a time" is just an introductory phrase, not a second clause.  
b This is a complex sentence because it has a subordinate clause introduced by "Though" ("Though she was a nice little girl") plus a main clause ("she was not an ordinary child"). The subordinate clause depends on the main clause, so the sentence is complex.  
c This is a simple declarative sentence with one independent clause stating an action; it is not a question.  
d This is an affirmative (positive) sentence because it states something directly without negation; the subject "Her parents" performs the action "liked."  
e This is active voice, not passive, because the subject "Everyone" performs the action "praised" rather than receiving it.  
f This is a simple declarative sentence (not exclamatory); it states a fact about her attentiveness in a neutral tone.  
g This is a simple sentence with a single independent clause ("She also helped her mother in her free time"), so it is not complex.  
h This is a negative declarative sentence because the adverb "never" negates the verb "told"; it is not an interrogative (no question form).  
i This expresses a superlative idea ("one of the most intelligent"), so it is not the positive degree; "most" shows a highest degree of comparison.  
j This is a simple sentence: one main clause ("She worked hard") with an infinitive phrase ("to shine in life") as purpose, but no additional clause, so it is not complex.

Question:
(a) Cricket is a very exciting game. (Exclamatory sentence)

(b) People of all ages enjoy this game. (Passive voice)

(c) It is played all over the world. (Active voice)

(d) At present, it is the most popular game in our country. (Comparative Degree)

(e) Though cricket is a costly game, people of all classes enjoy playing it. (Simple sentence)

(f)The game is played between two teams each consisting of eleven players. (Complex sentence)

(g) There are two umpires who conduct the game. (Simple sentence)

(h) It is full of thrill and excitement for the spectators. (Interrogative sentence)

(i) Bangladesh is a test-playing country developing its standard day by day. (Compound sentence)

(j) We must try our best to improve its present position. (Negative sentence without changing meaning)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
a To make it exclamatory we express strong feeling by using an exclamation or exclamatory structure, e.g. “What an exciting game cricket is!” or “Cricket is a very exciting game!” with an exclamation mark.

b In passive voice the object becomes the subject and we add “by …”, so “People of all ages enjoy this game” becomes “This game is enjoyed by people of all ages,” which shows the action received by the subject.

c Active voice names the doer as the subject; the active form is “People play it all over the world,” where “people” perform the action on “it.”

d Comparative degree uses “more … than” instead of “most,” so say “At present, it is more popular than other games in our country,” which directly compares two or more items.

e A simple sentence contains a single independent clause; combining the ideas without a subordinating conjunction gives a simple form like “Cricket is a costly game enjoyed by people of all classes,” using a participial phrase to keep it one clause.

f A complex sentence has a main clause plus a subordinate clause; for example, “The game is played between two teams, each of which consists of eleven players” has the main idea and a relative clause giving extra information.

g A simple declarative form removes the relative clause: “Two umpires conduct the game.” This is one independent clause stating a single fact.

h An interrogative sentence inverts the auxiliary and subject: “Is it full of thrill and excitement for the spectators?” uses subject–auxiliary inversion and a question mark to ask about the state.

i A compound sentence joins two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction: “Bangladesh is a test-playing country, and it is developing its standard day by day,” which links two equal ideas.

j To make it negative without changing the meaning use a phrase that denies failure, e.g. “We must not fail to try our best to improve its present position,” which keeps the original obligation but in negative form.

Question:
(a) Terrorism is a devastating phenomenon of the modern world. (Exclamatory)

(b) At present, it is called a challenge to fight against it. (Active)

(c) Who is not now in the threat of violence? (Assertive)

(d) Terrorism is more disastrous than anything. (Positive)

(e) It is one of the most corrosive problems of the modern world. (Comparative)

(f) Nobody wants his children to be terrorist in future. (Interrogative)

(g) Though there is law to punish the terrorists, it is not properly applied. (Simple)

(h) By applying the law properly, we can get rid of it. (Complex)

(i) We have to create social awareness to fight against corruption. (Compound)

(j) We all should avoid the killers of mankind. (Negative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
ক The sentence is a simple declarative (assertive) statement giving information and ends with a full stop, so it is not exclamatory; an exclamatory sentence would show strong emotion and use an exclamation form. 

খ This is passive voice: the verb phrase "is called" shows the subject receives the action; an active form would be "People call it a challenge." 

গ It is an interrogative sentence because it begins with the question word "Who" and asks a question, so it cannot be classified as assertive. 

ঘ The adjective "more disastrous" expresses comparison, so the sentence is comparative in degree, not positive. 

ঙ The phrase "one of the most corrosive" uses the superlative "most," so this is a superlative-degree expression, not merely comparative. 

চ This is an assertive (declarative) negative idea—"Nobody wants…" states a fact and ends with a period, so it is not interrogative. 

ছ The sentence contains a subordinate clause introduced by "Though…" plus a main clause, so it is a complex sentence rather than a simple one. 

জ Although it begins with a participial phrase ("By applying the law properly"), the structure has only one independent clause ("we can get rid of it"), so grammatically it is a simple sentence. 

ঝ This line expresses a single idea with one independent clause ("We have to create…"), so it is a simple sentence, not a compound sentence. 

ঞ The sentence gives a positive/affirmative instruction ("should avoid"), so it is not negative; a negative sentence would include words like "not" or "never."

Question:
(a) Health is wealth. (Make complex sentence)

(b) A healthy poor man is happier than a sick moneyed man. (Use positive degree)

(c) Though a healthy man is an asset to his family, an unhealthy man is a liability. (Make compound sentence)

(d) He can succeed in life. (Make interrogative sentence)

(e) So, everybody cannot but be conscious of his health. (Make affirmative sentence)

(f) Everybody must take care of his health all the time. (Make negative sentence)

(g) Health can be improved by regular physical exercise and a balanced diet. (Use active voice)

(h) People who are poor cannot afford to take a balanced diet. (Make simple sentences)

(i) They are very concerned with the quantity of food. (Make exclamatory)

(j) Everybody should know it that malnutrition causes weakness. (Use passive voices)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Because health is wealth, one should take care of it.
Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it has a subordinate clause ("Because health is wealth") that gives a reason and a main clause ("one should take care of it").

(b) A healthy poor man is not less happy than a sick moneyed man.
Explanation: The positive degree uses the base adjective "happy"; adding "not less" expresses the same comparison without using the comparative form "happier."

(c) A healthy man is an asset to his family, but an unhealthy man is a liability.
Explanation: This is a compound sentence formed by joining two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction "but."

(d) Can he succeed in life?
Explanation: Forming an interrogative here requires inverting the auxiliary "can" and the subject "he."

(e) So, everybody must be conscious of his health.
Explanation: "Cannot but be conscious" means "must be conscious," so removing the negation yields the affirmative form.

(f) Everybody must not neglect his health at any time.
Explanation: A negative construction that preserves the original meaning uses "must not neglect" to show prohibition/avoidance.

(g) Regular physical exercise and a balanced diet can improve health.
Explanation: Changing to active voice makes the agents ("regular physical exercise and a balanced diet") the subject that performs the action on "health."

(h) People are poor. They cannot afford to take a balanced diet.
Explanation: The relative clause ("who are poor") is split into a simple sentence about people’s condition and a separate simple sentence stating they cannot afford a balanced diet.

(i) How concerned they are about the quantity of food!
Explanation: An exclamatory sentence uses "How" + adjective to express strong feeling about their concern.

(j) It should be known by everybody that weakness is caused by malnutrition.
Explanation: The main clause is put into passive voice ("It should be known by everybody") and the fact is expressed passively ("weakness is caused by malnutrition").

Question:

(i) It is greater than all other inventions of modern science. (Make it superlative)

(j) The invention of computer is a great miraculous event. (Make it exclamatory)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
a We see the achievements of science everywhere.
Explanation: The complex phrase "Wherever we may cast our eyes" is simplified to the clear subject–verb–adverbial order "We see ... everywhere," keeping the original meaning but using a simple sentence.

b The electricity lights neither the streets nor the houses.
Explanation: To make the sentence negative for both items we use the correlative negative "neither ... nor," which negates lighting of both streets and houses.

c News, songs and lectures are broadcast by the radio.
Explanation: In passive voice the objects ("news, songs and lectures") become the subject, the verb becomes "are broadcast," and the original subject ("the radio") follows with "by."

d There is cinema in the evening that people can enjoy.
Explanation: This makes the sentence complex by adding a subordinate relative clause "that people can enjoy," which gives additional information about the evening cinema.

e The computer is an important invention of modern science.
Explanation: Changing "one of the most important" to "an important" converts the sentence from a superlative/ordinal idea to the positive degree, stating importance simply.

f No one can go without it.
Explanation: An assertive sentence states a fact; replacing the question with the declarative "No one can..." asserts the intended meaning directly.

g The internet is more important than the computer.
Explanation: To make a comparative, use "more ... than" to compare the two items, replacing the equal comparison "as ... as."

h It helps us, and it informs us about the world.
Explanation: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses ("It helps us" and "it informs us about the world") with the coordinating conjunction "and."

i It is the greatest of all the inventions of modern science.
Explanation: To form the superlative, use "the greatest" plus "of all" to show it ranks above every other invention.

j What a great and miraculous event the invention of the computer is!
Explanation: An exclamatory sentence begins with "What" + adjective(s) + noun and then the subject and verb, expressing strong feeling about the event.

Question:
(a) Haji Mohammad Mohsin was more gracious than any other man in this subcontinent. (Positive)

(b) He was born in Hoogli. (Complex)

(c) He inherited a vast property from his father and sister. (Interrogative without changing meaning)

(d) He did not misuse this wealth. (Passive)

(e) He is called a friend of humanity. (Active)

(f)He did not marry. (Affirmative)

(g) During his lifetime, he spent money lavishly to help the poor. (Compound)

(h) He was very kind to the poor: (Negative without changing meaning)

(i)One day when a thief entered his room, he caught him. (Simple)

(j)He caught the thief but did not punish him. (Complex)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) The original uses a comparative ("more ... than any other") which is equivalent to a superlative; to make the positive degree we use the base adjective with an intensifier (e.g. "very gracious"). This keeps the meaning but removes the comparative form.

(b) A complex sentence has a main clause plus a subordinate clause; add a relative or adverbial clause for extra information (e.g. "He was born in Hoogli, which is in Bengal") to make it complex.

(c) Past simple questions use the auxiliary "did" plus the base verb, so the interrogative form is "Did he inherit a vast property from his father and sister?" The main verb becomes the base form "inherit" and "did" marks the past.

(d) Passive of a past simple negative uses "was not" + past participle: "This wealth was not misused by him." The object becomes the subject and the agent is optional with "by."

(e) To change passive to active make the agent the subject: "People call him a friend of humanity." The verb changes accordingly and the object becomes the direct object.

(f) To express the same idea affirmatively without "not," use an adjective: "He remained unmarried." This affirmative form conveys the same meaning as "He did not marry."

(g) A compound sentence joins two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction; e.g. "He spent money lavishly to help the poor, and people benefited greatly from his generosity." This preserves the original idea while adding a second independent clause.

(h) Use the negative of an antonym to keep the meaning: "He was not unkind to the poor." Saying "not unkind" expresses the same positive idea without the original phrasing.

(i) A simple sentence has one subject and one predicate; combine the actions around a single subject: "One day a thief entered his room and was caught." Here "a thief" is the single subject with a compound predicate, making the sentence simple.

(j) Use a subordinating conjunction to form a complex sentence showing contrast: "Although he caught the thief, he did not punish him." The subordinate clause ("Although he caught the thief") plus the main clause make it complex.

(d) The lazy suffer miserably in the long run. (Exclamatory)

(h) In youth mind is soft and it can be shaped easily. (Simple)

(i) Unless you use the morning hours of life, you have to pay a heavy price afterwards. (Compound)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) This is an assertive (declarative) simple sentence because it states a fact with a single subject–predicate structure and ends with a full stop.

(b) This is a complex sentence: the subordinate conditional clause "If he makes a proper use of his time" depends on the main clause "he is sure to prosper in life," so there are two clauses with a dependent–independent relationship.

(c) This is a simple (assertive) sentence; "doing otherwise" is a participial phrase modifying "person," but the sentence contains only one main clause that makes a statement.

(d) This is an assertive simple sentence because it states a fact about a group in one independent clause; an exclamatory sentence would show strong emotion or use an exclamation mark.

(e) This is an assertive (declarative) sentence: an infinitive phrase serves as subject and predicate ("To kill time" = "to commit suicide"), so it makes a statement, not a question.

(f) This is an assertive (declarative) simple sentence because it gives a single factual statement about life in one main clause.

(g) This is an assertive sentence that uses the superlative degree ("most valuable"); it declares a fact and contains a superlative adjective, so it is not merely the positive degree.

(h) This is a compound sentence: it joins two independent clauses ("mind is soft" and "it can be shaped easily") with the coordinating conjunction "and."

(i) This is a complex sentence because the subordinate concessive/conditional clause "Unless you use the morning hours of life" depends on the main clause "you have to pay a heavy price afterwards," so one clause is dependent on the other.

Question:
(a) Man is the best creation of God. (Comparative)

(b) Isn’t it our responsibility to do good deeds? (Assertive)

(c) Our life is not measured by months or years. (Active)

(d) Honest people lead a happy life. (Complex)

(f) Nobody is absolutely happy on earth. (Affirmative)

(g)So, we should not waste time in vain. (Passive)

(h) If we use time properly, we can be benefited. (Simple)

(i) All men must die. (Negative)

(j) Though we take utmost care, we cannot avoid death. (Compound)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "Man is the best creation of God." → Comparative: change the superlative "best" to the comparative "better" and add a comparison, e.g. "Man is better than other creations of God." This is because comparative degree (better) compares two or more items and uses "than" to show the comparison.

(b) "Isn’t it our responsibility to do good deeds?" → Assertive: make it a statement: "It is our responsibility to do good deeds." Turn the question into a declarative sentence by removing inversion and the negative auxiliary ("Isn't") and using the affirmative verb form.

(c) "Our life is not measured by months or years." → Active: make the agent the subject, e.g. "Nobody measures our life by months or years." Passive "is measured" becomes active "measures" and you supply a subject (nobody/people) while keeping the negation.

(d) "Honest people lead a happy life." → Complex: add a subordinate clause to show reason or condition, e.g. "Honest people lead a happy life because they have peace of mind." A complex sentence has one independent clause plus a dependent (subordinate) clause like "because…" to show cause or condition.

(e) "It matters little if a man lives many years or not." → Interrogative: form a question: "Does it matter if a man lives many years or not?" Turn the statement into a question by inserting the auxiliary "does" and inverting the subject and auxiliary.

(f) "Nobody is absolutely happy on earth." → Affirmative: express the same idea without a negative word, e.g. "Everyone has some unhappiness on earth." To convert a negative sentence to an affirmative equivalent, replace the negative subject ("nobody") with a positive subject ("everyone") and rephrase the predicate to keep the original meaning.

(g) "So, we should not waste time in vain." → Passive: make "time" the subject, e.g. "So, time should not be wasted in vain (by us)." In passive voice the object of the active sentence becomes the subject, and the verb becomes a form of "be" + past participle; the agent ("by us") is optional.

(h) "If we use time properly, we can be benefited." → Simple: convert to a single independent clause, e.g. "We can benefit by using time properly." A simple sentence has one independent clause, so combine the idea into one clause (using a gerund or rephrasing) and use active verb "benefit."

(i) "All men must die." → Negative: put the statement in negative form, e.g. "All men do not live forever." This negates the predicate ("do not live forever") while preserving the original sense that mortality is inevitable.

(j) "Though we take utmost care, we cannot avoid death." → Compound: join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction, e.g. "We take utmost care, yet we cannot avoid death." A compound sentence links two independent clauses of equal rank using conjunctions like "and," "but," or "yet."

গ ভুল: বাক্যটি active voice — subject "People" কাজটি করছে; passive হলে হবে "A corrupt man is hated by people." তাই এটি passive নয়।  

ঘ ভুল: "Nobody respects him." একটি ঘোষণামূলক (declarative) বাক্য, প্রশ্নবোধক হলে হবে "Does nobody respect him?" তাই এটি interrogative নয়।  

ঙ ভুল: বাক্যে "who takes bribe" নামধারা (relative clause) আছে, তাই এটি কেবল সরল বাক্য নয়; একটি উপবাক্যসহ হওয়ায় এটি complex sentence হিসেবে গণ্য হবে।  

চ ভুল: "Though we have strict law" একটি অসম্পূর্ণ (subordinate) concessive clause, এবং মূল বাক্য আছে — এটি compound নয়; এটি একটি complex বাক্য (subordinate + main clause)।  

ছ সঠিক: "No other person is as hated as a corrupt man." বাক্যটি তুলনামূলকভাবে সর্বোচ্চ ঘৃণার বিষয়টি প্রকাশ করে এবং অর্থটিতে superlative অর্থ আছে, তাই এটি superlative ধারণ করে।  

জ ভুল: বাক্যে প্রধান ধারা "We hope" এবং একটি that‑clause আছে ("that Bangladesh will be free…"), তাই এটি সরল নয়; এটি complex sentence (main + subordinate)।  

ট ভুল: "Everybody avoids a corrupt man." হল ইতিবাচক/affirmative বাক্য; নেতিবাচক (negative) হলে হবে "Nobody avoids…" বা "Everybody does not avoid…" তাই এটি negative নয়।

(h) By paying taxes he obeys the law. (Compound)

(i) He is respected by all. (Active)

(j) So we should be patriots. (Imperative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) The sentence is a declarative (assertive) simple sentence because it states a fact: subject + verb + complement, with no question or command.  
(b) This is a superlative (not comparative) declarative sentence because the word "greatest" shows the highest degree among all.  
(c) The sentence is affirmative (positive) and declarative because it affirms an action; there is no negation word like "not" or "never."  
(d) This is a complex sentence: the main clause ("This quality highly motivates a man") is followed by a subordinate purpose clause ("so that he can sacrifice his life for the country").  
(e) It is exclamatory because it expresses strong feeling using "What ...!" rather than making a plain statement.  
(f) Grammatically this is a simple sentence with a participial phrase ("having patriotic zeal") modifying "a man"; it does not contain a separate clause, so it is not complex.  
(g) The sentence is negative in meaning because "none" (no one) negates the verb—so it expresses negation rather than being purely affirmative.  
(h) This is a simple sentence: a single independent clause with an introductory adverbial phrase ("By paying taxes"); it is not two independent clauses joined, so it is not compound.  
(i) The sentence is passive voice because the subject ("He") receives the action ("is respected") rather than doing it; the active form would be "All respect him."  
(j) This is a declarative suggestion (modal statement) using "should," not an imperative command; an imperative would be "Be patriots."

Question:
(a) Corruption is one of the worst evils. (Positive) (b) A corrupt man can do anything against morality. (Complex) (c) People hate a corrupt man. (Passive) (d) Nobody respects him. (Interrogative) (e) The man who takes bribe, is next to devil. (Simple) (f) Though we have strict law, we are still affected by this evil. (Compound) (g) No other person is as hated as a corrupt man. (Superlative) (h) We hope that Bangladesh will be free from this evil. (Simple) (i) Everybody avoids a corrupt man. (Negative) (j) A corrupt man leads a very unhappy life. (Exclamatory)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) This sentence uses "worst," the superlative form of the adjective "bad," so it expresses the highest degree and is a superlative sentence.  
(b) It is a simple sentence because it has a single independent clause (one subject and one predicate) and no subordinate clauses.  
(c) This is active voice: the subject "People" performs the action "hate"; the passive would be "A corrupt man is hated by people."  
(d) "Nobody respects him" is a negative declarative sentence because "nobody" negates the verb; an interrogative would ask, e.g. "Does anybody respect him?"  
(e) It is a complex sentence because the relative clause "who takes bribe" is a subordinate clause modifying "the man," attached to a main clause.  
(f) This is complex: "Though we have strict law" is a subordinate concessive clause and "we are still affected…" is the main clause, so they form a complex sentence (not a compound).  
(g) The phrase "No other person is as hated as a corrupt man" conveys that he is the most hated, i.e., it expresses a superlative comparison in meaning.  
(h) This is a complex sentence: the main clause "We hope" takes a subordinate noun clause "that Bangladesh will be free…" as its object, so it is not simple.  
(i) "Everybody avoids a corrupt man" is an affirmative simple sentence (one independent clause), so it is not negative.  
(j) This is a declarative/simple sentence stating a fact; an exclamatory version would use an exclamation form (e.g., "What an unhappy life a corrupt man leads!").

(i) We can get many new pieces of information by using it. (Make it a compound sentence)

(j) Would that I could open a Facebook account. (Make it an assertive sentence)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Facebook is not a common social network.
Explanation: Form a negative by placing "not" after the verb "is" to negate the statement.

(b) Now, people are using it all over the world.
Explanation: Change passive to active by supplying a doer ("people") and using the active verb form ("are using").

(c) Does everybody use it?
Explanation: Make a present-simple question by adding the auxiliary "does" before the subject and using the base verb "use."

(d) Every student has a smart phone.
Explanation: Convert the negative expression "no student without" into an affirmative universal statement using "every" and "has."

(e) Nobody dislikes social networks.
Explanation: Change the interrogative "Who does not..." into a declarative by stating the negative in a simple affirmative clause ("Nobody dislikes...").

(f) Facebook is good.
Explanation: Replace the superlative "the best" with the positive (base) adjective "good" to express the positive degree.

(g) It gives pleasure and restricts our freedom to use it.
Explanation: Make a simple sentence by keeping one subject ("It") and giving it a compound predicate ("gives... and restricts..."), so only one independent clause remains.

(h) If you do not use it, you cannot keep pace with the modern world.
Explanation: Form a complex sentence by introducing a dependent conditional clause ("If you do not use it") and linking it to the main clause.

(i) We can get many new pieces of information by using it, and we can share them with others.
Explanation: Create a compound sentence by joining two independent clauses with "and," each clause able to stand alone.

(j) I wish I could open a Facebook account.
Explanation: Turn the optative/exclamatory "Would that I could..." into an assertive declarative by using "I wish..." to state the same desire.

Question #319 (ID: 481318)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type: CQ | Book: English 2nd Paper | Years: 2018 | Boards:  | Tags: All Board
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
(a) Very few conquerors of the world were so great as Taimur. (Superlative)

(b) The province of a powerful prince was once attacked by young Taimur. (Active)

(c) Entering the kingdom of the prince, he captured a large village. (Compound)

(d) The army killed Taimur’s all soldiers. (Passive)

(e) He disguised himself as a poor traveler to survive. (Complex)

(f) He came to a house and asked for something to eat. (Simple)

(g) There lived an old woman in the house. (Complex)

(h) The woman became sympathetic to see Taimur. (Interrogative)

(i) The food was very hot. (Exclamatory)

(j) Taimur was too hungry to wait. (Negative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Taimur was one of the greatest conquerors of the world.

(b) Once young Taimur attacked the province of a powerful prince.

(c) He entered the kingdom of the prince and captured a large village.

(d) Taimur's all soldiers were killed by the army.

(e) He disguised himself as a poor traveller so that he could/might survive.

(f) Coming to a house, he asked for something to eat.

(g) There lived in the house a woman who was old.

(h) In the house, there lived a woman who was old.

(h) Didn't the woman become sympathetic to see Taimur?

(i) How hot the food was!

(j) Taimur was so hungry that he could not wait.

Explanation:
a This expresses a superlative idea because it compares Taimur with almost all other conquerors ("very few ... so great as"), showing he stands at the highest degree of greatness.

b Incorrect — the sentence is passive: the subject ("The province") receives the action and the agent appears after "by" ("by young Taimur"); the active form is "Young Taimur once attacked the province of a powerful prince."

c Incorrect — this is complex, not compound: it has a main clause ("he captured a large village") and a dependent participial clause ("Entering the kingdom of the prince") that modifies it, so one independent plus one subordinate element.

d Incorrect — the sentence is active because "The army" is the doer performing the action "killed"; the passive version would be "All Taimur’s soldiers were killed by the army."

e Correct — it is complex: there is a main clause ("He disguised himself as a poor traveler") and a subordinate infinitive of purpose ("to survive"), so one independent clause plus a dependent purpose phrase.

f Correct — it's a simple sentence with one subject ("He") and a compound predicate ("came ... and asked"), so a single independent clause describing two actions by the same subject.

g Incorrect — this is simple, not complex: "There lived an old woman in the house" is a single independent clause (existential construction) with no subordinate clause.

h Incorrect — the sentence is declarative, not interrogative: it states a fact ("The woman became sympathetic...") and does not ask a question; an interrogative would use question word/order or a question mark.

i Incorrect — as written it is a declarative statement describing the food; an exclamatory sentence would show strong feeling or use exclamatory form (e.g., "How hot the food was!").

j Incorrect — the sentence uses the "too ... to ..." degree construction (affirmative) to show excess, not negation; a negative sentence would include "not" or another negative word.

(h) We/People call it the pleasure seekers' paradise.

(i) Every year a lot of people come here and (they) visit it.

(j) I wish I could visit the sea-beach.

Explanation:
(a) My friend invited me to pay a visit to Cox’s Bazar, which I gladly accepted.
Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it joins a main clause with a relative clause "which I gladly accepted," adding extra information about the invitation.

(b) I was not very glad.
Explanation: Adding "not" makes the sentence negative while keeping the same tense and subject.

(c) The invitation was accepted by me.
Explanation: Passive voice is formed by making the object ("the invitation") the subject and using the auxiliary "was" + past participle "accepted."

(d) My friend received me cordially.
Explanation: This is a simple sentence with one independent clause expressing a single complete idea.

(e) How excited I was to see the sea beach!
Explanation: An exclamatory sentence uses "How" + adjective to express strong feeling or surprise.

(f) It is a very large sea beach.
Explanation: The positive degree uses the base adjective "large" (here strengthened by "very") instead of the superlative "largest."

(g) It is more beautiful than many other sea beaches in the world.
Explanation: The comparative degree is formed with "more" + adjective and "than" to compare it with other beaches.

(h) People call it the pleasure seekers’ paradise.
Explanation: Active voice uses a clear subject ("People") performing the action ("call") on the object ("it").

(i) Every year a lot of people come to visit it, and they enjoy the beach.
Explanation: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses ("a lot of people come..." and "they enjoy...") with the coordinating conjunction "and."

(j) I wish I could visit the sea beach.
Explanation: This assertive (declarative) sentence states the speaker’s wish directly instead of the exclamatory form.

(i) She set up 'Nirmal Hridoy' and it was at Kolkata.

Explanation:
(a) Is Mother Teresa an icon to many people?
Explanation: The sentence is made interrogative by inverting the auxiliary verb "is" and the subject "Mother Teresa".

Explanation: Converted the passive "is respected by everybody" into active voice by making "everybody" the subject and "respects" the verb.

Explanation: Formed a compound sentence by joining two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction "and".

(i) Their contribution will always/ever be remembered.

(j) Some steps to improve their condition have been taken by the government.

or, Some steps have been taken by the government to improve their condition.

Explanation:
(a) "We are not grateful to the freedom fighters."  
Explanation: This is the negative form of the affirmative sentence; adding "not" after the verb "are" makes the sentence negative.

(b) "No other thing is as great as their contribution."  
Explanation: To change a superlative/comparative into the positive degree we use the structure "as + adjective + as"; this shows equality in positive form.

(c) "Some freedom fighters died in the Liberation War, and they are called martyrs."  
Explanation: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses ("Some freedom fighters died..." and "they are called martyrs") with a coordinating conjunction "and."

(d) "The National Memorial has been built so that people may pay tribute to their memories."  
Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it has a main clause and a subordinate purpose clause ("so that...") showing why the memorial was built.

(e) "A freedom fighter is greater than any other son of the soil."  
Explanation: A comparative sentence uses "greater than" to compare one thing with others, replacing the superlative "greatest."

(f) "They fought bravely and snatched the red sun of independence."  
Explanation: This is a simple sentence with one subject "They" and a compound predicate ("fought... and snatched..."), so it remains simple.

(g) "What a passionate woman Mother Teresa was!"  
Explanation: An exclamatory sentence expresses strong feeling; beginning with "What" and reordering the clause makes it exclamatory.

(h) "Their weapons were ordinary, but they had much courage in their minds."  
Explanation: Turning the subordinate contrast into two independent clauses joined by "but" makes it a compound sentence that shows contrast.

(i) "People will always remember their contribution."  
Explanation: To make the sentence affirmative, remove the negation "never" and use a positive adverb "always," here with an active subject "People."

(j) "Some steps have been taken by the government to improve the condition."  
Explanation: Converting the active sentence to passive makes the object "some steps" the subject and uses the correct tense form "have been taken" to match present perfect.

(h) How interesting some books are!

(i) If we read books, we can build up a developed society.

(j) Only books can remove the darkness of ignorance.

Explanation:
(a) We should read books because they help us gain knowledge.
Explanation: Using "because" joins an independent clause and a subordinate clause, so the sentence becomes complex and shows reason.

(b) We are introduced to the realm of knowledge by books.
Explanation: The object "us" becomes the subject and the doer "books" is placed after "by", forming the passive voice.

(c) Do the books of great writers contain noble thoughts and great ideas?
Explanation: For present simple questions we add the auxiliary "do" before the subject to form an interrogative sentence.

(d) Reading books enriches our minds.
Explanation: This is a single independent clause with a gerund subject, so it is a simple sentence expressing one complete idea.

(e) Books are great friends.
Explanation: Replacing the superlative "greatest" with the positive degree "great" produces the positive form.

(f) They do not give us either knowledge or pleasure.
Explanation: To make a negative of "both ... and" we use "do not" plus "either ... or" to negate the two items.

(g) They are our real friends, and they remain with us in time of danger.
Explanation: Two independent clauses are joined with the coordinating conjunction "and," making the sentence compound.

(h) How interesting some books are!
Explanation: Using "How" + adjective + subject + verb forms an exclamatory sentence showing strong feeling.

(i) If we read books, we can build up a developed society.
Explanation: Beginning with "if" creates a subordinate (conditional) clause plus a main clause, so the sentence becomes complex.

(j) Only books can remove the darkness of ignorance.
Explanation: Replacing the negative phrase "Nothing but" with the affirmative limiter "Only" produces an affirmative sentence.

Question:
(a) There was an old man in a village. (Interrogative) (b) He was very poor but honest. (Complex) (c) He was one of the best cap makers with palm leaves. (Positive) (d) He sold them in the neighbouring market. (Voice change) (e) Earning money in this way, he thus maintained his family. (Compound) (f) One day he could not but go to a market. (Affirmative) (g) The market was far from his house. (Negative) (h) He had a basket full of caps. (Complex) (i) He was too tired to walk. (Compound) (j) He sat under the tree and fell asleep. (Simple)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Wasn't there an old man in a village?

(b) Though he was very poor, he was honest.

(c) Very few cap makers with palm leaves were so/as good as he.

(d) They were sold in the neighbouring market by him.

(e) He earned money in this way and thus maintained his family.

(f) One day he had to go to a market.

(g) The market was not near his house.

(h) He had a basket which was full of caps.

(i) He was very tired and could not walk.

(j) Sitting under the tree, he fell asleep.

Explanation:
(a) Was there an old man in the village? — Change to a question by inverting the auxiliary verb "was" before the subject; "There was..." becomes "Was there...?" to form an interrogative.

(b) Though he was very poor, he was honest. — This is complex because a subordinate clause ("Though he was very poor") is joined to the main clause to show contrast, so one clause depends on the other.

(c) He was a good cap maker with palm leaves. — "One of the best" is a superlative; the positive degree replaces it with "good" to state the quality without comparison.

(d) They were sold by him in the neighbouring market. — Passive voice makes the object ("them") the subject and uses the appropriate auxiliary + past participle, with the agent added by "by him."

(e) He earned money in this way, and thus he maintained his family. — Two independent clauses ("He earned..." and "he maintained...") are joined with the coordinating conjunction "and," making a compound sentence.

(f) One day he had to go to a market. — "Could not but go" is a negative idiom meaning necessity; the affirmative equivalent is "had to go," keeping the same meaning in positive form.

(g) The market was not near his house. — To make it negative, negate the statement by inserting "not" and restating the idea in opposite terms while keeping tense and subject.

(h) He had a basket that was full of caps. — A relative clause ("that was full of caps") modifies "basket," creating a complex sentence with a main clause plus a dependent clause.

(i) He was too tired, so he could not walk. — Two related independent clauses expressing cause and effect are joined by "so," forming a compound sentence.

(j) He sat under the tree and fell asleep. — This is a simple sentence because it has one subject ("He") with a compound predicate ("sat... and fell asleep"), so it remains a single independent clause.

(b) Any answer in the exam should not be elaborated. (Active)

(c) When he gets the question paper he should read it carefully. (Simple)

(d) At first glance, the questions may seem difficult. (Negative)

(h) It is really sensible. (Exclamatory)

(i)The examinee should not waste time by doing it. (Passive)

(j) Without following this process, you cannot bring a good result in an examination. (Compound)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Strategy is more important than any other thing (or, all other things) in the examination.

(b) The examinees/The students should not elaborate any answer in the examination.

(c) After getting/Getting the question paper, he should read it carefully.

(d) At first glance, the questions may not seem easy.

(e) A student should attempt to answer all the questions so that s/he can/may get good marks.

(f) Seeing answering all the question by an examinee, the examiner become glad.

(g) But not answering at all is not as/so good as it.

(h) How sensible it is!

(i) Time by doing it should not be wasted by the examinee.

(j) Follow this process or you cannot bring a good result in an examination.

Explanation:
(a) The label “Comparative” is incorrect; the sentence uses the superlative phrase “most important,” so it is a superlative statement, not comparative—comparative would use “more important.”

(b) The label “Active” is incorrect; “should not be elaborated” is passive voice (modal + past participle). An active form would be “You should not elaborate any answer.”

(c) This is a complex sentence because it has a subordinate adverbial clause “When he gets the question paper” plus the main clause “he should read it carefully,” so there are two clauses with a dependent–independent relationship.

(d) The label “Negative” is wrong; the sentence is affirmative (positive) in meaning—“may seem difficult” expresses a possibility, not a negation.

(e) The label “Complex” is incorrect; this is a simple sentence with one finite verb phrase “should attempt” and an infinitive phrase of purpose “to get good marks,” so it contains only one independent clause.

(f) The label “Simple” is incorrect; this is a complex sentence because it begins with the conditional subordinate clause “If an examinee answers all the questions” followed by the main clause “the examiner becomes glad to see that.”

(g) The label “Positive” is acceptable: the sentence is affirmative (not negative). Although it contains a comparative “better than,” it is a positive/affirmative statement rather than a negative one.

(h) The label “Exclamatory” is incorrect; the sentence is a plain declarative statement (“It is really sensible”), not formed or punctuated as an exclamation.

(i) The label “Passive” is incorrect; this is an active sentence with a modal verb (“should not waste”) where the subject “The examinee” performs the action—passive would be “Time should not be wasted by the examinee.”

(j) The label “Compound” is incorrect; the sentence is simple: it has one independent clause “you cannot bring a good result in an examination” with a prepositional/participial phrase “Without following this process” serving as an adverbial modifier, not a second independent clause.

(b) He was born in Hoogly. (complex)

(c) He inherited a vast property from his father and sister. (Interrogative)

(d) He did not misuse this wealth. (Passive)

(e)He is called a friend of humanity. (Active)

(f) He didn’t marry. (Affirmative)

(g) During his life time, he spent money lavishly to help the poor. (Compound)

(h) He was very kind to the poor. (Negative)

(i) One night when he was saying his prayer, a theif broke into his room. (Simple)

(j) He caught the thief but didn’t punish him. (Complex)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) No other man in this subcontinent was so/as generous as Haji Muhammad Mohsin.

(b) It is Hoogly where he was born. / Hoogly is the place where he was born.

(c) Didn't he inherit a vast property from his father and sister?

or. Did he not inherit a vast property from his father and sister?

(d) This wealth was not misused by him.

(e) People/We call him a friend of humanity.

(f) He was unmarried.

Or, He was a bachelor.

Or. He was single.

(g) During his lifetime, he spent money lavishly and helped the poor.

Or, He wanted to help the poor and so he spent money lavishly during his life time.

(h) He was not at all cruel/unkind to the poor.

(i) One night, at the time of his saying prayer, a thief broke into his room.

Or, One night during his prayer, a thief broke into his room.

(j) Though/Although he caught the thief, he did not punish him.

Explanation:
a Correct classification: Superlative. The sentence compares him with every other man ("more ... than any other"), which expresses the highest degree; the positive degree would be just "generous" without comparison.

b Correct classification: Simple sentence. It has a single independent clause ("He was born in Hoogly") with no subordinate clause or coordinated clause, so it is simple rather than complex.

c Correct classification: Declarative (statement). The sentence states a fact; an interrogative would be formed as "Did he inherit a vast property...?" so the given form is not a question.

d Correct classification: Active (negative). The subject "He" performs the action ("did not misuse"), so it is active voice with negation; the passive would be "This wealth was not misused by him."

e Correct classification: Passive. "He is called a friend of humanity" shows the subject receiving the action (being called), so it is passive, not active.

f Correct classification: Negative. "He didn't marry" contains negation ("didn't"), so it is a negative sentence; the affirmative form would be "He married."

g Correct classification: Simple sentence. It contains one main clause with adverbials ("During his life time, he spent...") and no second independent clause, so it is not compound.

h Correct classification: Affirmative. "He was very kind to the poor" affirms a quality and contains no negation, so it is affirmative, not negative.

i Correct classification: Complex sentence. It has a main clause ("a thief broke into his room") plus a subordinate time clause ("when he was saying his prayer"), so it is complex.

j Correct classification: Compound sentence. It joins two independent clauses ("He caught the thief" and "didn’t punish him") with the conjunction "but," so it is compound rather than complex.

Question:
(a) Who does not want to succeed in life? (Assertive)

(b) It is not an easy thing. (Affirmative)

(c) Being industrious, everyone can prosper in life. (Negative)

(d) The idle always lag behind. (complex)

(e) We must work hard so that we can earn money. (simple)

(f) By working hard, we can improve our lot. (compound)

(g) The light of prosperity can be seen by a hard working person. (Active)

(h) Women should work as much as men. (comparative)

(i) We should remember that industry is the key to success. (passive)

(j) An idle man leads a very miserable life. (Exclamatory)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Everybody wants to succeed in life.

Or, There is nobody but wants to succeed in life.

(b) It is a difficult thing.

(c) Without being industrious, no one can prosper in life.

Or, Being lazy/idle, none can prosper in life.

(d) Those who are idle, always lag behind.

(e) We must work hard to earn money.

(f) We will work hard and thus we can improve our lot.

(g) A hard-working person can see the light of prosperity.

(h) Women should not work less than men.

(i) It should be remembered by us that industry is the key to success.

Or, That industry is the key to success should be remembered by us.

(j) What a miserable life an idle man leads!

Explanation:
(a) Who does not want to succeed in life? — This is an interrogative sentence because it asks a question beginning with the question word "Who", so it is not assertive.

(b) It is not an easy thing. — This is negative: the word "not" negates the statement, so it is not an affirmative sentence.

(c) Being industrious, everyone can prosper in life. — This is affirmative because the main clause ("everyone can prosper") affirms a positive possibility; the opening participle phrase does not make it negative.

(d) The idle always lag behind. — This is a simple declarative sentence with one subject and one predicate, so it is simple rather than complex.

(e) We must work hard so that we can earn money. — This is complex because it has a main clause ("We must work hard") plus a subordinate purpose clause ("so that we can earn money").

(f) By working hard, we can improve our lot. — This is a simple sentence: one main clause with an introductory participial phrase, not a compound (which would have two independent clauses).

(g) The light of prosperity can be seen by a hard working person. — This is passive voice because the subject ("the light of prosperity") receives the action and the agent appears in a "by" phrase; the active form would be "A hard-working person can see the light of prosperity."

(h) Women should work as much as men. — This is comparative (equality) because "as much as" compares the amount of work between women and men.

(i) We should remember that industry is the key to success. — This is active voice: the subject "we" performs the action "should remember"; it is not passive.

(j) An idle man leads a very miserable life. — This is a declarative/affirmative (assertive) sentence stating a fact; it is not exclamatory, which would express strong emotion or use an exclamation.

Question:
how dare you are to wake me up the lion roared i shall kill you for that please let me go the mouse cried i did not mean to wake you up

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"How daring you are to wake me up?" the lion roared. "I shall kill you for that." "Please, let me go." the mouse cried, "I did not mean to wake you up."

Explanation:
The correction is right because each spoken line is written as direct speech in quotation marks, begins with a capital letter, and ends with punctuation that matches the tone (an exclamation for anger, a period for a statement). When a speech tag follows in the same sentence, put a comma inside the closing quote before the tag (for example, "Please let me go," the mouse cried), but if the speech ends with an exclamation or question mark the strong punctuation stays inside the quotes and the tag is lowercased (for example, "How dare you wake me up!" the lion roared). These punctuation rules make it clear who is speaking and preserve the intended emotion.

Question:
(a) We should read books to acquire knowledge. (Make complex sentence)

(b) Books introduce us to the realm of knowledge. (Use passive voice)

(c) The books of great writers contain noble thoughts and great ideas. (Make interrogative sentence)

(d) By reading good books, we can enrich our mind. (Make compound sentence)

(e) Reading books is a very good habit. (Make exclamatory sentence)

(f) This habit is rarely disliked. (Affirmative)

(g) More and more books should be read. (Use active voice)

(h) No other thing is as interesting as reading books. (Use comparative degree)

(i) When we read good books, we discover new worlds. (Make simple sentence)

(f) Very few friends are as great as a good book. (Make superlative degree)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) We should read books so that we can acquire knowledge.

(b) We are introduced to the realm of knowledge by books.

(c) Don't the books of great writers contain noble thoughts and great ideas?

(d) We read books and we can enrich our mind.

(e) What a good habit reading books is!

(f) This habit is always/mostly/commonly/often liked.

(g) We should read more and more books.

(h) Reading books is more interesting than any other thing/anything.

(i) By reading good books, we discover new worlds.

Or. At the time of reading good books, we can discover new worlds.

(j) A good book is one of the greatest friends.

Explanation:
(a) We should read books so that we may acquire knowledge.  
This is a complex sentence because it has a main clause ("We should read books") and a subordinate purpose clause ("so that we may acquire knowledge").

(b) We are introduced to the realm of knowledge by books.  
Passive voice is formed with a form of "be" + past participle; the original object ("us"/"we") becomes the subject and "books" becomes the agent introduced by "by."

(c) Do the books of great writers contain noble thoughts and great ideas?  
To make it interrogative, place the auxiliary "do" before the subject ("the books") and keep the main verb in base form.

(d) By reading good books, we can enrich our mind, and we can broaden our knowledge.  
This is a compound sentence because it joins two independent clauses ("we can enrich our mind" and "we can broaden our knowledge") with the coordinating conjunction "and."

(e) What a very good habit reading books is!  
An exclamatory sentence uses "What..." (or "How...") to show strong feeling and inverts the usual order for emphasis.

(f) Most people like this habit.  
To make it affirmative, express the idea positively: "rarely disliked" becomes "liked by most people" (here phrased as "Most people like this habit").

(g) People should read more and more books.  
Active voice makes the doer ("People") the subject who performs the action, instead of the passive "books should be read."

(h) Reading books is more interesting than anything else.  
Use the comparative form "more ... than" to compare reading books with other things.

(i) Reading good books opens up new worlds.  
A simple sentence has a single independent clause; here "Reading good books" is the subject and "opens up new worlds" is the predicate.

(f) A good book is the best of friends.  
To form the superlative, use "best" to show the highest degree, replacing the comparative idea "as great as."

(j) The bear went away and he escaped himself. (Make it a complex sentence)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Once upon a time, there were two friends who were passing by a forest.

(b) Weren't they talking about their love for each other?"

(c) Suddenly they saw a bear coming towards them.

(d) It was the first friend who climbed up a tree.

(e) The latter was unable to climb up a tree.

(f) No way was found by him.

(g) Lying down on the ground, he feigned death.

(h) His ears, nose and face were smelt by the bear.

(i) He was thought that he was dead/The bear thought that he was dead/It was he who was thought to be dead.

(j) When the bear went away, he escaped himself.

Explanation:
(a) Complex sentence: Once upon a time, two friends were passing by a forest when they heard a rustling sound.
Explanation: This is complex because it has an independent clause ("two friends were passing by a forest") and a dependent time clause introduced by "when"; the dependent clause adds extra information and makes the sentence complex.

(b) Interrogative: Were they talking about their love for each other?
Explanation: Forming a question requires inversion of the auxiliary verb and the subject ("Were" + "they"), which turns the statement into an interrogative.

(c) Simple sentence: Suddenly, they saw a bear approaching.
Explanation: The simple sentence contains a single main clause with one verb phrase ("saw a bear approaching"); removing the relative clause makes it one independent clause.

(d) Complex sentence: When the bear appeared, the first friend climbed up a tree.
Explanation: This is complex because it joins a subordinate time clause ("When the bear appeared") to the main clause, so there is a dependent clause plus an independent clause.

(e) Affirmative sentence: The latter failed to climb up the tree.
Explanation: This affirmative form conveys the same idea without using "not" by using a positive verb ("failed") to express inability.

(f) Passive voice: No way was found by him.
Explanation: In passive voice the object ("no way") becomes the subject and the verb uses a form of "to be" + past participle ("was found"), with the agent optionally added ("by him").

(g) Simple sentence: He lay on the ground, feigning death.
Explanation: Using the participle phrase "feigning death" attaches information to the main clause without adding another clause, so the sentence remains one simple clause.

(h) Passive voice: His ears, nose, and face were smelled by the bear.
Explanation: The object(s) ("his ears, nose, and face") become the subject of the passive clause, followed by "were" + past participle ("smelled"), and the agent is introduced with "by the bear."

(i) Complex sentence: Because he lay motionless, people thought that he was dead.
Explanation: This is complex because it contains a subordinate reason clause ("Because he lay motionless") plus the main clause; the subordinate clause explains why the main clause happened.

(j) Complex sentence: After the bear went away, he escaped.
Explanation: The time clause "After the bear went away" is a dependent clause joined to the main clause "he escaped," making the sentence complex.

Question:
(a) William Wordsworth is one of the best well-known poets in English literature (Positive).

(b) He was the second of his father’s five sons (Negative).

(c) He was born at Cumberland on April 4, 1770 (Complex).

(i) The readers called for a new edition of his famous book “The Lyrical Ballads” in 1800 (Passive).

(j) This book brought a huge name and fame in his life (Exclamatory).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Very few well-known poets in English literature are as/so good as William Wordsworth.

(b) Wasn't he the second of his father's five sons?

Or. He was none but the second of his father's five sons.

(c) Cumberland was the place where he was born on April 4, 1770.

Or, He was born in Cumberland when it was April 4, 1770.

Or, When it was April 4, 1770, he was born in Cumberland.

(d) His mother died at his eight years old.

Or. At his eight years old his mother died.

(e) In the same year he was sent to the Grammar School of Hawkshead and he was educated there.

(f) Wasn't he only 13 years old when his father died?

(g) The teachers had given him fundamental education at the school.

(h) The education learnt from this institution played better role in his life.

(i) A new edition of his famous book, "The Lyrical Ballads" was called for by the readers in 1800.

(j) What a name and fame this book brought in his life!

Explanation:
Explanation:

a Correctly called “Positive” because it is an affirmative (declarative) sentence stating a fact about Wordsworth without any negation or question.

b This is not a negative sentence; it is an affirmative declarative stating a fact. A negative sentence would include words like “not” or other negators.

c The sentence is not complex; it is a simple declarative with a time phrase [math]“on April 4, 1770”[/math] rather than a subordinate clause. A complex sentence needs a dependent clause with its own subject and verb.

d This is actually complex, not simple, because it begins with the subordinate clause [math]“When he was eight years old”[/math] (it has its own subject and verb) followed by the main clause “his mother died.”

e This is not compound but a simple sentence: it contains a single independent clause describing an action in that year, with no second independent clause joined by a conjunction.

f It is not interrogative; it is a declarative sentence. It is complex because the phrase [math]“when his father died”[/math] is a subordinate clause attached to the main clause.

g This sentence is passive (the action is received: “had been given to him”); the active form would be “The school had given him fundamental education.” Therefore labeling it “Active” is incorrect.

h This is complex, not simple, because it contains a relative (dependent) clause [math]“that he learnt from this institution”[/math] modifying “The education,” so there is more than one clause.

i The sentence is active: “The readers” is the subject performing the action “called for.” The passive version would be “A new edition was called for by the readers,” so labeling it “Passive” is wrong.

j This is a declarative sentence, not exclamatory; an exclamatory sentence would show strong emotion and typically use an exclamation form (e.g., “What a famous book this was!”).

(b) He is older than I. (Positive degree)

(c) He wants his students to be good citizen. (Complex)

(d) He leaves no stone unturned to teach them morality. (Affirmative)

(h) He cannot remain sitting in the class. (Affirmative)

(i) He goes to class after taking preparation. (Compound)

(j) All the students respect him very much. (Passive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Mr. Rahim, who is a good teacher, is one of my cousins.

Or, Mr. Rahim, who is one of my cousins, is a good teacher.

or, Mr. Rahim is a good teacher who is one of my cousins.

(b) I am not as old as he.

(c) He wants that his students will/may/should be good citizens.

(d) He tries his best to teach them morality.

(e) How happy he becomes when the students achieve good results in public examinations!

(f) Besides being punctual Mr. Rahim is sincere.

(g) No other teacher in our area is so/as good as he.

(h) He is unable to remain sitting in the class.

or, Can he remain sitting in the class?.

(i) He takes preparation and goes to class.

(j) He is very much respected by all the students.

Explanation:
(a) This is a simple sentence with an appositive phrase "one of my cousins" giving extra information about the subject; there is only one finite verb ("is"), so it's simple.

(b) "Older" is the comparative degree of "old" used to compare two people, so the sentence shows a comparative degree.

(c) This is a simple sentence: one main clause ("He wants") with an object phrase ("his students to be good citizens"); the infinitive phrase does not make a separate clause.

(d) It is affirmative because it states a positive action (he tries very hard); there is no negation.

(e) This is a complex sentence: it has a main clause ("He becomes very happy") and a subordinate adverbial clause introduced by "when" ("when the students achieve good results"), so there are two parts with different roles.

(f) It is simple: one subject and one finite verb ("is"), with two linked adjectives joined by the correlative pair "not only... but also," so still a single clause.

(g) "Best" is the superlative degree of "good/good," showing the highest degree among more than two, so the sentence expresses a superlative.

(h) This is negative because it contains the negative auxiliary "cannot," indicating inability or impossibility.

(i) It is a complex sentence because the main action ("He goes to class") is followed by a subordinate time/condition phrase ("after taking preparation"), forming a main clause plus a subordinate element.

(j) The sentence is active voice: the subject ("All the students") performs the action ("respect him"); the passive form would be "He is respected by all the students."

(h) A successful man is very happy. (Exclamatory)

(i) No other man is as happy as a successful man. (Superlative)

(j) A hardworking man is healthier than an idle man. (Positive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Everybody wants to succeed in life.

(b) Is it known to you?

(c) A man who is industrious will shine in life.

(d) We need hard work for success.

(e) A life without an assignment is not an actual life.

(f) No one can receive any reward without working hard.

(g) Can one be successful without it?

(h) How happy a successful man is!

(i) A successful man is the happiest man.

(j) An idle man is not so healthy as a hard-working man.

Explanation:
(a) Assertive: "Everyone wants to succeed in life."  
Reason: An interrogative asking if anybody does not want success is best turned into a universal affirmative by stating the general truth — "everyone" — as the assertive form.

(b) Passive: "Is it known to you?"  
Reason: To make passive, the object "it" becomes the subject and the verb changes to passive form "is known," with "to you" indicating the agent/recipient.

(c) Complex: "If a man is industrious, he will shine in life."  
Reason: A complex sentence has a main clause plus a subordinate clause; using an "if" conditional links cause (being industrious) to result (shining in life), forming a complex sentence.

(d) Active: "One must work hard to succeed."  
Reason: Change the impersonal passive "is needed" into an active verb with an explicit subject ("one") so the doer performs the action in the active voice.

(e) Negative: "A life without an assignment is not an actual life."  
Reason: Negation is formed by replacing "with" by "without" and adding "not" to deny the original affirmative statement.

(f) Simple: "Hard work is necessary for any reward."  
Reason: A simple sentence states the idea directly without subordinate clauses; replacing "No one can receive… unless…" by a single-clause statement expresses the same necessity simply.

(g) Interrogative: "Can one be successful without it?"  
Reason: To form a question, invert the modal auxiliary "can" and the subject "one" so the sentence becomes interrogative.

(h) Exclamatory: "How happy a successful man is!"  
Reason: Exclamatory sentences use "how" (or "what") plus an adjective/noun to express strong feeling, turning a plain statement into an exclamation.

(i) Superlative: "A successful man is the happiest of all."  
Reason: The superlative uses "the" + adjective + "-est" (or "most") to show the highest degree; "of all" emphasizes comparison with everyone else.

(j) Positive: "A hardworking man is healthy; an idle man is not."  
Reason: The positive degree states qualities without comparison by using the base adjective ("healthy") and, if contrast is needed, the opposite form for the other subject.

(e) Ruplal decided to go and live alone in the jungle so that he could find peace.

(f) So collecting his things, he went to live by himself.

(g) A nice little hut was made for himself by Ruplal.

(h) I am very happy now.

(i) Very few places in the world are so/as peaceful as my jungle hut.

(j) During sleeping that night, Ruplal heard a noise.

Or, At the time of sleeping that night, Ruplal heard a noise.

Explanation:
Explanation:

a A long time ago there lived a young man called Ruplal, and he led a simple life.  
This is a compound sentence because it joins two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction "and."

b Did he live with his family and work on a farm?  
This is a yes/no interrogative formed by using the auxiliary "did" and the base form of the verbs.

c Although it was a beautiful place, there were a lot of problems.  
This is a complex sentence because "Although..." introduces a subordinate clause that contrasts with the main clause, so one clause depends on the other.

d The village people were not quarrelsome.  
The negative is formed by inserting "not" after the auxiliary verb "were."

e Ruplal decided to go and live alone in the jungle so that he could find peace.  
This is complex because "so that..." introduces a dependent clause of purpose, explaining why he decided to go.

f Collecting his things, he went to live by himself.  
This is a simple sentence with a single main clause; the participial phrase "Collecting his things" modifies the subject but does not create a second clause.

g A nice little hut was made by Ruplal in the jungle.  
This is the passive voice: the object of the active sentence becomes the subject, and the verb becomes the appropriate form of "to be" + past participle.

h I am very happy now.  
This assertive (declarative) sentence states the speaker’s feeling as a fact rather than exclaiming it.

i My jungle hut is peaceful.  
This uses the positive degree of the adjective "peaceful" (the base form) instead of the superlative "one of the most peaceful."

j That night he heard a noise.  
This is a simple sentence because it has a single main clause expressing one complete idea.

Question:
(a) Corruption is one of the worst evils. (Positive)

(b) A corrupted man can do anything against morality. (Complex)

(c) People hate a corrupted man. (Passive)

(d) Nobody respects him. (Interrogative)

(e) The man who takes bribe is next to devil. (Simple)

(f) Though we have strick law, we are still affected by this evil. (Compound)

(h) We hope that Bangladesh will be free from this evil. (Simple)

(i) Everybody avoids a corrupted man. (Negative)

(j) A corrupted man leads a very unhappy life. (Exclamatory)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Very few evils are so bad as corruption.

(b) A corrupt man can do anything which is against morality.

Or. A man, who is corrupt, can do anything against morality.

(c) A corrupt man is hated by people.

(d) Does anybody respect him?

Or. Who respects him?

(e) The man taking bribe is next to devil.

(f) We have strict law, but we are affected by this evil.

(g) A corrupt man is the most hated person.

(h) We hope Bangladesh to be free from this evil.

(i) There is nobody but avoids a corrupt man.

Or. Nobody mixes with a corrupt man.

Or. There is nobody who does not avoid a corrupt man.

(j) What an unhappy life a corrupt man leads!

Explanation:
a This is a positive (affirmative) sentence because it states a fact/opinion directly without any negation or question; it affirms that corruption is among the worst evils.

b It is called complex because the main idea ("A corrupted man can do anything") is expanded by an additional clause/phrase ("against morality") that describes manner and tightens the meaning; a complex sentence mixes a main clause with subordinate information to give fuller detail.

c The label “passive” applies when the object becomes the subject, e.g. the passive form is "A corrupted man is hated by people"; passive voice is formed with an appropriate form of "be" + past participle to show the action is received.

d An interrogative asks a question; to make this sentence interrogative we invert the auxiliary: "Does nobody respect him?" or more naturally "Does anyone respect him?"; the sentence form changes to request information rather than state a fact.

e It’s treated as simple here because it expresses one main idea with a single finite verb ("is"); though it contains a relative phrase ("who takes bribe") that describes the subject, the sentence conveys one complete thought centered on "is next to devil."

f It’s labeled compound because it shows two contrasted clauses joined by a conjunction and expressing related ideas: one clause states a condition ("Though we have strict law") and the other states the result/contrast ("we are still affected by this evil"); such coordination or linking of clauses yields a compound/complex sense that contrasts two equal points.

g This is marked superlative because it expresses the highest degree of hatred by comparing everyone else to the corrupted man ("No other person is as hated as a corrupted man"), effectively singling him out as most hated.

h It’s classed simple because it conveys a single straightforward thought ("We hope") with a clear object clause; the sentence is a single declarative statement expressing a hope about Bangladesh’s future.

i It’s considered negative in sense because it indicates refusal of association—people do not associate with him ("everybody avoids him"), so the sentence expresses a negative social response even though grammatically it uses an affirmative verb.

j The exclamatory label applies when the idea is expressed with strong feeling, e.g. as an exclamation: "What an unhappy life a corrupted man leads!"—such a form uses exclamatory structure or punctuation to show strong emotion.

Question:
(a) Bangladesh is a low-lying country. (Make interrogative)

(b) Every year natural disasters visiť us. (Make passive voice)

(c) Flood is one of the most dangerous natural disasters. (Use comparative degree)

(d) It is Dhaka city which has not yet suffered any severe earthquake. (Make simple sentence)

(e) The people living in the high land can escape flood. (Make complex sentence)

(f) Crops are damaged by this flood. (Make active voice)

(g) Who does not know the consequence of 'Tsunami'? (Make assertive sentence)

(h) The recent flood was very devastating. (Make exclamatory sentence)

(i) Bangladesh is in the active earthquake zone. (Make negative)

(j) Dhaka is the most risky city in the earthquake zone. (Use positive degree)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Isn't Bangladesh a low-lying country?

(b) We are visited by natural disasters every year.

(c) Flood is more dangerous than most other natural disasters.

(d) Dhaka city has not yet suffered any severe earthquake.

(e) The people who live in the high land, can escape flood.

Or. It is the people who live in the high land can escape flood.

Or. There are people who tive in the high land can escape flood.

(f) This flood damages crops.

(g) Everybody knows the consequences of Tsunami.

(h) How devastating the recent flood was!

(i) Bangladesh is not in the inactive earthquake zone.

(j) No other city in the earthquake zone is so/as risky as Dhaka.

Explanation:
(a) Is Bangladesh a low-lying country?
This is a yes/no question formed by inverting the subject and the auxiliary verb "is" because the original sentence has no auxiliary.

(b) We are visited by natural disasters every year.
In passive voice the object ("us") becomes the subject ("we"), the original subject becomes the agent introduced by "by," and the tense (simple present) is kept with "are visited."

(c) Floods are more dangerous than many other natural disasters.
To make a comparative, use "more + adjective + than" to compare floods with other natural disasters; here "more dangerous than" replaces the superlative phrase.

(d) Dhaka city has not yet suffered any severe earthquake.
Remove the cleft structure "It is ... which" and put the real subject "Dhaka city" before the verb to make a simple sentence.

(e) The people who live on the high land can escape floods.
A complex sentence is formed by adding a subordinate relative clause "who live on the high land" describing "the people."

(f) This flood damages crops.
Convert to active voice by making the agent "this flood" the subject and changing the verb to the active form "damages."

(g) Everyone knows the consequences of a tsunami.
Change the interrogative into a declarative (assertive) sentence; "everyone knows" states the idea positively.

(h) What a devastating flood the recent one was!
Use an exclamatory structure with "What" + noun phrase (or "How" + adjective) and invert the subject and verb to show strong feeling.

(i) Bangladesh is not in the active earthquake zone.
Form the negative by inserting "not" after the auxiliary verb "is."

(j) Dhaka is a risky city in the earthquake zone.
Use the positive (base) form of the adjective "risky" instead of the superlative "most risky" to state the quality without comparison.

(h) By watching television, you can learn many things.

(i) People watch television and thus spend their free time.

(j) Television is one of the most useful things.

Explanation:
ক বাক্যটি ইতিবাচক (affirmative), কারণ এতে কোনো নেতিবাচক পদ নেই এবং বক্তব্য সরাসরি একটি সত্য স্থাপনা করেছে: টেলিভিশন আধুনিক বিজ্ঞানের একটি বিস্ময়কর আবিষ্কার।  

খ এটি নেতিবাচক ও বহুবচনীয় (passive) ধাঁচের বাক্য: "not" থাকার কারণে নেতিবাচক এবং কৃত্যটি বিষয় (it) কর্তৃক গ্রহণ করা হয়েছে, তাই passive voice।  

গ এখানে একক বিষয় ("Scientists") ও দুটো ক্রিয়া ("spent" এবং "worked") যুক্ত আছে, তাই এটি একটি simple sentence‑এর মতো একক স্বাধীন বাক্য যার compound predicate আছে।  

ঘ বাক্যটি ইতিবাচক (affirmative), কারণ এতে কোনো না-উপস্থিতি বা প্রশ্ন নেই — এটি সরাসরি জানাচ্ছে যে প্রায় প্রত্যেক পরিবারের টেলিভিশন আছে।  

ঙ এটি সাধারণ বিবৃতিমূলক (declarative) বাক্য, কারণ এটি কোনো প্রশ্ন করে না বা না-প্রকাশ করে; এটি কেবল একটি তথ্য দিচ্ছে যে সকল বয়সীদের মানুষদের টিভি দেখা ভালো লাগে।  

চ বাক্যটি সাধারণ সরল বাক্য যেখানে "telecast by television" একটি participle phrase হিসেবে "programmes" কে বর্ণনা করছে; বাক্যটির কাঠামো একটাই স্বাধীন ধারা, তাই এটি simple declarative।  

ছ বাক্যটি active voice—"Television" বিষয় হিসেবে কাজ করে এবং সরাসরি কর্মটি করছে ("should telecast"), তাই এটি passive নয় (passive হলে হবে: "Educative programmes should be telecast by television")।  

জ এটি একটি complex sentence কারণ এতে একটি শর্তসাপেক্ষ subordinate clause ("If you watch television") এবং একটি স্বাধীন মূল clause ("you can learn many things") আছে; শর্তাধীন clause একা দাঁড়াতে পারে না।  

ঝ বাক্যটি একটি সরল স্বাধীন বাক্য, একমাত্র স্বাধীন ধারা আছে যা বলছে মানুষ তাদের অবসর কিভাবে কাটায়; তাই এটি simple sentence।  

ঞ এটি তুলনামূলক (comparative) আকারে বক্তব্য করছে ("so useful as"), কারণ এটি টেলিভিশনকে অন্য কিছুর সঙ্গে তুলনা করছে; যদি superlative হতো তাহলে "the most useful" জাতীয় শব্দ ব্যবহার হতো।

Question:
(a) My friend invited me to pay a visit to Cox’s Bazar. (complex)

(b) I was very glad. (negative)

(c) I accepted the invitation. (Passive)

(d) When I reached there, my friend received me cordially. (simple)

(h) It is called the pleasure seekers’ paradise. (Active)

(i) Every year a lot of people come to visit it. (Compound)

(j) If I could visit the sea-beach! (active)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) My friend invited me that/ in order that/ so that I could/might pay a visit to Cox's Bazar.

Or, It is my friend who invited me to pay a visit to Cox's Bazar.

Or, Cox's Bazar is the place where my friend invited me to visit.

(b) I was not (very) displeased/unhappy/sad at all.

Or, I could not but become glad.

(c) The invitation was accepted by me.

(d) My friend received me cordially at the time of my reaching there.

Or, After/On reaching/Reaching there, my friend received me cordially.

(e) How excited I was to see the seabeach!

(f) It is larger than any other sea-beach (all other sea-beaches) in the world.

(g) Very few seabeaches in the world are so/as beautiful as it.

(h) We/People call it the pleasure seekers paradise.

(i) Every year a lot of people come here and (they) visit it.

(j) I wish I could visit the seabeach.

Or, Would that I could visit the seabeach.

Explanation:
(a) To make it a complex sentence you need a main clause plus a subordinate clause; for example, add a reason or time: "My friend invited me to pay a visit to Cox’s Bazar because he wanted to show me around." A complex sentence has one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.

(b) Make it negative by placing "not" after the auxiliary verb: "I was not very glad." Negation is formed by adding "not" (or a contraction) to the verb phrase.

(c) Passive: turn the object into the subject and use the appropriate form of "be" + past participle: "The invitation was accepted by me." In passive voice the original object becomes the subject and the doer is optional after "by."

(d) To make it a simple sentence remove the subordinate clause and keep a single independent clause: "My friend received me cordially." A simple sentence has one independent clause only.

(e) Exclamatory: express strong feeling with "How" or an exclamation mark: "How excited I was to see the sea-beach!" Exclamatory sentences show strong emotion and often begin with "What/How" or end with an exclamation mark.

(f) Comparative: compare two things using "more/er ... than": e.g., "It is larger than any other sea-beach nearby." Comparative degree uses "more" or "-er" plus "than" to show comparison between two items.

(g) Positive: use the base adjective without comparison or superlative: "It is beautiful." The positive degree simply states the quality without comparing it to others.

(h) Active: make the agent the subject and use an active verb: "People call it the pleasure seekers’ paradise." In active voice the subject performs the action directly.

(i) Compound: join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction: "Every year a lot of people come to visit it, and they enjoy the beach." A compound sentence has two (or more) independent clauses joined by and, but, or, etc.

(j) Active: the sentence is already active because the subject "I" is the doer of "visit" (expressing a wish): "If I could visit the sea-beach!" Active voice has the subject performing the action.

Question:

(b) Isn’t it the symbol of love and beauty?(Affirmative)

(c) Flowers are used on different occasions.(Active)

(d) We present flower to our nearest and dearest person.(Passive)

(e) We need flowers to decorate a place.(Complex)

(f) The rose is the best of all flowers.(Positive)

(g) Having sweet scent and beauty we love it very much.(Compound)

(h) It is lovelier than all other flowers.(Superlative)

(i) The rose is a very nice flower.(Exclamatory)

(j) As the demand for flowers is increasing day by day we should cultivate flower on commercial basis.(Simple)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Isn't a flower a glowing gift of nature?

(b) It is the symbol of love and beauty.

(c) People/We use flowers on different occasions.

(d) Flower is presented to our nearest and dearest persons by us.

(e) We need flowers so that we can decorate a place..

(f) No other flower is as/so good as the rose.

(g) It has sweet scent and beauty and so we love it very much.

(h) It is the loveliest of all flowers.

or, It is the loveliest flower.

(i) What a nice flower the rose is!

(j) Because of the increasing demand for flowers day by day, we should cultivate flower on commercial basis.

Explanation:
(a) To make it interrogative you invert the auxiliary and subject; since the verb is [math]is[/math], ask: "Is a flower a glowing gift of nature?" This makes it a question.

(b) Change the negative question to a positive statement by removing the negative contraction and the question mark: "It is the symbol of love and beauty." This makes it affirmative.

(c) The sentence is passive ("are used"); to make it active, put the doer as the subject and change the verb: "People use flowers on different occasions." Passive agent becomes the subject in active voice.

(d) To form the passive from the active, make the object the subject and use the appropriate form of "to be" + past participle: "Flowers are presented to our nearest and dearest person (by us)." This shows passive construction.

(e) To make it complex, add a subordinate clause (reason/purpose) with a subordinating conjunction: "Because we want to decorate a place, we need flowers." A complex sentence has an independent clause plus a dependent clause.

(f) "The rose is the best of all flowers" is superlative; the positive degree removes comparison: "The rose is good" or "The rose is a beautiful flower." Positive degree uses the base adjective without comparative/superlative markers.

(g) Turn the participial phrase into a separate independent clause and join with a coordinating conjunction to make a compound sentence: "The flower has a sweet scent and beauty, and we love it very much." A compound sentence connects two independent clauses.

(h) Change the comparative phrase into the superlative by using "the" + superlative form: "It is the loveliest of all flowers." Superlative shows the highest degree among all.

(i) Use an exclamatory structure with "What" or "How": "What a very nice flower the rose is!" This expresses strong feeling, so it becomes exclamatory.

(j) To make it simple, keep a single independent clause and remove the subordinating element: "We should cultivate flowers on a commercial basis." A simple sentence has only one independent clause.

Question:
(a) Haji Mohammad Muhsin was not an unkind man at all. (Affirmative)

(b) He inherited vast proerty from his father and sister. (Interrogative)

(c) He was unmarried. (Negative)

(d) During his lifetime, he spent money lavishly to help the poor. (Complex)

(e) One night when he was saying his prayer, a thief broke into his room. (Simple)

(f) Seeing Muhsin the thief cried. (compound)

(g) The thief was caught. (Active)

(h) How needy the thief was! (Assertive)

(i) He gave the thief some food and money. (Passive)

(j) Muhsin was one of the best philanthropists in the world. (Positive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Haji Mohammad Muhsin was a very kind man.

(b) Didn't he inherit vast property from his father and sister?

(c) He was not married/He did not marry.

(d) When he was alive, he spent money lavishly to help the poor.

Or. It was his lifetime when he spent money lavishly to help the poor room.

(e) One night at the time of saying his prayer, a thief broke into his room.

Or. One night while praying a thief broke into his room.

Or. One night during the time of saying his prayer, a thief broke into his room.

(f) The thief saw Muhsin and cried.

(g) Muhsin/He caught the thief.

(h) The thief was very needy.

(i) Some food and money were given to the thief by him.

Or, The thief was given some food and money by him.

(j) Very few philanthropists in the world were so/as good as Muhsin.

Explanation:
(a) The sentence uses litotes (“not unkind”) but conveys a positive meaning; the clear affirmative form is “Haji Mohammad Muhsin was a kind man.” Affirmative sentences state something positively rather than denying it.

(b) To make it interrogative use the auxiliary + subject + base verb pattern: “Did he inherit vast property from his father and sister?” Interrogative sentences are formed by inversion and end with a question mark.

(c) “He was unmarried” is negative because the prefix “un-” shows negation (not married); you can also write it as “He was not married.” Negative sentences express non-existence or denial.

(d) It’s complex because it has a main clause “he spent money lavishly” plus a subordinate purpose clause “to help the poor” (and a temporal phrase “During his lifetime”). A complex sentence contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause or phrase.

(e) A simple sentence has one independent clause expressing a single idea; the simple version is “One night a thief broke into his room.” It contains one main verb and one complete thought.

(f) A compound sentence joins two independent clauses of equal weight; e.g. “Muhsin saw the thief, and the thief cried.” Use a coordinating conjunction or semicolon to link the clauses.

(g) Active voice places the doer before the verb; the active form is “Someone caught the thief.” Convert passive to active by making the agent the subject and using the main verb in the appropriate tense.

(h) An assertive (declarative) sentence states a fact; the assertive form is “The thief was very needy.” It simply declares the thief’s condition without exclamation.

(i) Passive voice makes the object the subject: “Some food and money were given to the thief by him.” Form the passive with the correct form of “be” + past participle, and optionally include the agent with “by.”

(j) The sentence praises Muhsin, so it is positive in tone: it affirms a good quality (“one of the best philanthropists in the world”). Positive sentences state affirming information rather than negation.

(i) No other student in the class is as bad as a failed student.(Use superlative)

(j) So a student should be aware of studying regularly and attentively so that he can do well in the examination.(Make it a simple sentence)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) The students who study regularly can expect a good result.

(b) But most of our students are not attentive to their studies.

(c) Their valuable time is wasted idly by them.

(d) Isn't wasting time harmful to them?

(e) When as they repeat this activity, they make a poor result.

Or. If they repeat this activity, they will make a poor result.

(f) Everybody hates them then.

Or, Nobody loves them then.

(g) Even their family members treat them badly.

(h) By failing in the examination, a student suffers from inferiority complex.

(i) A failed student is the worst in the class.

(j) So a student should be aware of studying regularly and attentively, to do well in the examination.

Explanation:
(a) "If students study regularly, they can expect a good result."  
Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it has a subordinate clause ("If students study regularly") that conditionally supports the main clause ("they can expect a good result"), showing cause and result.

(b) "Most of our students are not attentive to their studies."  
Explanation: Changing "inattentive" to "not attentive" keeps the original negative meaning while using an explicit negative form.

(c) "Their valuable time is wasted idly by them."  
Explanation: The verb phrase is made passive ("is wasted"), moving the focus from the doer to the object ("their valuable time"); the agent "by them" shows who causes it.

(d) "Is wasting time harmful for them?"  
Explanation: To form the question, the auxiliary "is" is placed before the subject phrase "wasting time," turning the statement into an interrogative.

(e) "If they repeat this activity, they will make poor results."  
Explanation: This is a complex sentence: the conditional subordinate clause ("If they repeat this activity") leads to the main clause expressing the consequence ("they will make poor results"), showing cause and effect. (You can also say "they will get poor results" for more natural wording.)

(f) "No one loves them then."  
Explanation: The interrogative "Who loves them then?" implies a negative answer; converting it to an assertive sentence uses "No one" to state that directly while preserving meaning.

(g) "Even their family members treat them badly."  
Explanation: Active voice makes the agent ("their family members") the subject performing the action ("treat them badly"), which reverses the original passive structure.

(h) "A failed student suffers from an inferiority complex."  
Explanation: This simple sentence condenses the conditional idea into a single statement by using "failed" as an adjective describing the student.

(i) "A failed student is the worst in the class."  
Explanation: The comparative idea ("No other student ... is as bad") is changed to a superlative form ("the worst") to show that the failed student ranks lowest among all students.

(j) "A student should study regularly and attentively to do well in the examination."  
Explanation: The complex original is simplified by combining purpose into an infinitive phrase ("to do well"), making one clear simple sentence that states duty and result.

Positive degree uses the base adjective "great" instead of the superlative/comparative phrase "one of the greatest."

(c) He was born at Sagordari, which lies on the bank of the Kapotaksho.  
This is a complex sentence because it has an independent clause ("He was born at Sagordari") plus a dependent relative clause ("which lies on the bank of the Kapotaksho") that adds extra information.

(d) As a boy he desired to be an Englishman.  
A simple sentence with one independent clause stating the subject, time phrase, and action.

(e) His teachers recognised him as a precious child.  
Active voice: the doer ("his teachers") is the subject and performs the verb "recognised" on the object "him."

(f) Did he think that he was born on the wrong side of the planet?  
Formed as an interrogative by using the auxiliary "did" for past tense and placing it before the subject.

(g) He also thought that his society did not appreciate his intellect.  
Negative sentence: "did not" negates the verb "appreciate," conveying the same idea as "was unable to appreciate."

(h) Again he believed that only the West would be more receptive to his creative genius.  
Affirmative form replaces the negative phrase "none but" with the positive word "only."

(i) Was he an ardent follower of Lord Byron?  
Interrogative formed by inverting the auxiliary "was" and the subject "he."

(j) He went to Europe and began composing poems.  
A simple sentence with one subject doing two actions (compound predicate) within a single independent clause.

Or. One night while saying his prayer, a thief broke into his room.

(j) Though/Although he caught the thief, he did not punish him.

Explanation:
(a) Answer: Haji Muhammad Muhsin was generous.
Explanation: "More generous" is comparative; the positive degree uses the base adjective "generous" without comparison.

(b) Answer: He was born in Hoogly, where he spent his early years.
Explanation: This is complex because it has one main clause ("He was born in Hoogly") and one dependent relative clause ("where he spent his early years") that cannot stand alone.

(c) Answer: Did he inherit a vast property from his father and sister?
Explanation: Past simple questions are formed by adding the auxiliary "did" and using the base form of the verb ("inherit"), with subject–auxiliary inversion.

(d) Answer: This wealth was not misused by him.
Explanation: Passive voice makes the object ("this wealth") the subject and uses a form of "be" + past participle ("was ... misused"); the agent can be added with "by ...".

(e) Answer: People call him the friend of humanity.
Explanation: Active voice names the doer ("People") as the subject and the person acted on ("him") as the object, using a simple present active verb ("call").

Explanation: This is an affirmative statement of the same fact; it reports his marital status without using negation.

Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it begins with a subordinate adverbial clause ("While he was alive") followed by the main clause describing his spending.

Explanation: This is a compound sentence: two independent clauses ("He was kind" and "he could not refuse anyone's request") joined by the coordinating conjunction "and."

Explanation: This is a simple sentence with a single independent clause; "during his prayer" is a prepositional phrase, not a subordinate clause.

(j) Answer: Although he caught the thief, he did not punish him.
Explanation: This is complex because it uses a subordinate concessive clause ("Although he caught the thief") plus a main clause ("he did not punish him"), showing contrast.

(j) Everybody should know it that malnutrition causes weakness. (Use passive voice)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) It is health which is wealth.

(b) A sick moneyed man is not as/so happy as a healthy poor man.

(c) A healthy man is an asset to his family but an unhealthy man is a liability.

(d) Can't he succeed in life?

(i) How concerned they are with the quantity of food!

Or. How concerned with the quantity of food they are!

(j) It should be known to everybody that weakness is caused by malnutrition.

Explanation:
(a) Since health is wealth, one should take care of it.
Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it has a main clause and a subordinate clause introduced by "since," which shows reason.

(b) A sick moneyed man is not as happy as a healthy poor man.
Explanation: The comparative "happier than" is changed to the positive-degree form "not as ... as," keeping the same meaning while using the base adjective "happy."

(c) A healthy man is an asset to his family, but an unhealthy man is a liability.
Explanation: Two independent clauses are joined by the coordinating conjunction "but," making a compound sentence.

(d) Can he succeed in life?
Explanation: Forming an interrogative with a modal verb requires inverting the subject and the auxiliary: "can" + subject + main verb.

(e) So, everybody must be conscious of his health.
Explanation: "Cannot but be" means "must be," so the affirmative form uses "must" + adjective to express the same idea.

(f) Everybody must not neglect to take care of his health all the time.
Explanation: This negative sentence uses "must not neglect to..." to express the required obligation in a negated form while preserving the original meaning.

(g) Regular physical exercise and a balanced diet can improve health.
Explanation: Convert the passive "Health can be improved by..." into active voice by making the agents the subject and the action active.

(h) Poor people cannot afford a balanced diet.
Explanation: The relative clause "who are poor" is reduced to the simple noun phrase "poor people," forming a simple sentence with one subject and one predicate.

(i) How concerned they are with the quantity of food!
Explanation: An exclamatory sentence is formed with "How" plus adjective and subject to express strong feeling.

(j) It should be known by everybody that weakness is caused by malnutrition.
Explanation: "Everybody should know" is changed to passive "It should be known by everybody," and "malnutrition causes weakness" is converted to the passive "weakness is caused by malnutrition."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
(a) Computer is one of the greatest inventions of modern science. (Positive) (b) Computer is a blessing on earth. (Negative) (c) Though it is a blessing, it has dark sides. (Simple) (d) Computers are nowadays being used in almost every sphere of life. (Active) (e) We cannot but depend on it. (Affirmative) (f) No one can deny its necessity. (Interrogative) (g) It is the most used device in our life. (Comparative) (h) It helps us a lot. (Passive) (i) Because of its usefulness, it has become very popular. (Compound) (j) Without computer, we cannot imagine our modern life. (Complex)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Correct: Positive (affirmative declarative). This sentence praises the computer and states a fact without any negation, so it is positive and declarative.  

(b) Correct classification is Positive, not Negative. The sentence expresses a favourable view (“a blessing”) and contains no negation, so it is positive.  

(c) Correct: Complex. The subordinating conjunction "Though" introduces a subordinate clause, so the sentence has a dependent clause plus a main clause, making it complex.  

(d) Correct: Passive. The verb phrase "are being used" is passive voice (the action is received by "computers"), not active.  

(e) Correct as Affirmative in meaning. Although it contains "cannot," the idiom "cannot but depend" means "must depend" (an affirmative meaning), so its force is affirmative.  

(f) Correct classification is Negative (declarative), not Interrogative. "No one" negates the sentence, so it is a negative declarative statement.  

(g) Correct: Superlative, not comparative. The word "most" shows the highest degree (superlative), whereas comparative would use "more."  

(h) Correct: Active. The subject "It" performs the action "helps," so the sentence is in active voice, not passive.  

(i) Correct: Simple (not compound). The sentence has a single independent clause with an adverbial phrase "Because of its usefulness," so it is a simple sentence.  

(j) Correct: Simple (not complex). "Without computer" is an introductory prepositional phrase and the rest is one independent clause, so the whole sentence is a simple declarative sentence.

Question:
(a) Terrorism is a devastating phenomenon of the modern world. (Exclamatory) (b) At present, it is increasing alarmingly. (Interrogative) (c) Nothing is as disastrous as terrorism. (Comparative) (d) It is one of the most corrosive problems of the modern world. (Positive) (e) A terrorist is hated by people. (Active) (f) Who is not now in the threat of violence? (Assertive) (g) Though there are laws to punish the terrorists, they are not properly applied. (Compound) (h) By applying the laws properly, we can get rid of terrorism. (Complex) (i) What a miserable life a terrorist leads! (Assertive) (j) They should be brought to book. (Active)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Correct: Exclamatory. Reason: The sentence expresses strong feeling and would normally end with an exclamation mark, which makes it exclamatory.

(b) Correct label: Declarative (Assertive), not Interrogative. Reason: It states a fact and ends with a full stop, so it is a statement, not a question.

(c) Correct: Comparative. Reason: The structure "as … as" compares two things, showing degree of comparison.

(d) Correct label: Superlative, not Positive. Reason: "one of the most corrosive" uses "most," indicating the highest degree among a group.

(e) Correct label: Passive, not Active. Reason: The subject ("A terrorist") receives the action ("is hated"); the active form would be "People hate a terrorist."

(f) Correct: Interrogative, not Assertive. Reason: It asks a question beginning with "Who," so it is an interrogative sentence.

(g) Correct: Complex, not Compound. Reason: It has a subordinate clause introduced by "Though" plus a main clause, so one dependent and one independent clause (complex).

(h) Correct label: Simple (Declarative), not Complex. Reason: There is a single main clause with a participial phrase ("By applying…")—so it is a simple declarative sentence.

(i) Correct: Exclamatory, not Assertive. Reason: "What a miserable life…!" expresses strong feeling and is an exclamation.

(j) Correct label: Passive, not Active. Reason: The verb phrase "should be brought" is passive (the subject receives the action).

(a) I am not doubtful that man is the maker of his own fortune. (আমার সন্দেহ নেই যে মানুষ নিজেই তার ভাগ্যের নির্মাতা।)

(b) Let a man make a proper use of his time to shine in life. (জীবনে উন্নতি করতে মানুষকে সময়ের যথাযথ ব্যবহার করতে দাও।)'

(c) To whom is it not known? (কার কাছে এটা জানা নেই?/কার কাছে এটি অজানা?)

(d) How miserably the lazy suffer in the long run! (পরিণামে অলসরা কতই না চরম কষ্ট ভোগ করে!) (e) To commit suicide is not more harmful than to kill time. (আত্মহত্যা করা সময় নষ্ট করার চেয়ে বেশি ক্ষতিকর নয়।)

(f) Our life is nothing but a sum total of hours, days and years. (আমাদের জীবন ঘন্টা, দিন এবং বছরের সমষ্টি ছাড়া আর কিছুই নয়।)

(j) People call it the seedtime of life. (লোকেরা একে জীবনের বীজ বপনের সময় বলে।)

Explanation:
(a) I am not sure that man is the maker of his own fortune.
Explanation: Negation is formed by inserting "not" after the auxiliary "am," which turns the affirmative certainty into its negative form.

(b) Use your time properly to shine in life.
Explanation: An imperative gives a direct command; here the verb "use" is in the base form addressing the reader to make the sentence imperative.

(c) By whom is it not known?
Explanation: To make the question passive, the object ("it") becomes the subject and the agent is expressed with "by," changing the structure while keeping the meaning.

(d) How miserably the lazy suffer in the long run!
Explanation: Exclamatory sentences often begin with "How" or "What" to emphasize feeling; here "How miserably..." expresses strong emotion about their suffering.

(e) Killing time is as harmful as committing suicide.
Explanation: Use of gerunds ("killing," "committing") and the structure "as ... as" makes a comparative of equality, showing two actions are equally harmful.

(f) Our life is not only a sum total of hours, days and years.
Explanation: Changing "only" to "not only" makes the sentence negative while implying there is more to life than just its measurable parts.

(g) Youth is a valuable season of life.
Explanation: Converting the superlative "most valuable" to the positive degree uses the base adjective "valuable," stating the quality without comparison.

(h) We can easily shape our minds in youth.
Explanation: Active voice makes the doer ("we") the subject and uses the verb "shape" directly; adverb placement "easily" modifies the verb.

(i) Utilize your time properly in youth.
Explanation: The imperative form uses the base verb "utilize" (or "use") to give a direct instruction to the reader.

(j) People call it the seedtime of life.
Explanation: To change from passive ("it is called") to active, introduce a subject ("People") who perform the action and use the verb "call."

(j) Some steps have been taken to improve their condition by the government. (তাদের অবস্থার উন্নতির জন্য সরকার কর্তৃক কিছু পদক্ষেপ গ্রহণ করা হয়েছে।)

Explanation:
(a) "We are not ungrateful to the freedom fighters."  
Explanation: Negation is formed by adding "not" or using the negative adjective "ungrateful"; here "are not ungrateful" expresses the negative of "are grateful."

(b) "Their contribution is the greatest."  
Explanation: Superlative degree uses "the" + adjective + "-est" (or "most"); "greatest" shows their contribution is highest among all.

(c) "Never disrespect or forget our martyrs."  
Explanation: Imperative sentences give commands and drop the subject "you"; the verbs start in base form ("disrespect", "forget") and "never" makes it a negative command.

(d) "They have built the national memorial to pay tribute to their memories."  
Explanation: To change passive to active, introduce the agent ("they") and use an active verb form ("have built") instead of "has been built."

(e) "A freedom fighter is greater than any other son of the soil."  
Explanation: Comparative degree compares two or more items using "greater than"; it replaces the superlative "greatest" with a comparative structure.

(f) "Our independence was won because of their sacrifice."  
Explanation: Passive form emphasizes the object ("our independence") by making it the subject and using a past passive verb phrase ("was won") while the agent may be omitted.

(g) "How bravely they fought to snatch the red sun of independence!"  
Explanation: Exclamatory sentences use "How" (with adverb) or "What" (with noun) + subject + verb to express strong feeling.

(h) "Their courage was powerful."  
Explanation: To put the sentence in the positive degree, remove the comparative "more ... than" and use the base adjective "powerful."

(i) "We will never forget their contribution."  
Explanation: Change passive ("will never be forgotten") to active by adding an agent ("we") and using an active verb ("will never forget").

(j) "Some steps have been taken by the government to improve their condition."  
Explanation: Passive is formed by making the object ("some steps") the subject and using the appropriate form of "be" + past participle ("have been taken"), with the agent added after "by."

Explanation:
Solution:
(a) Honesty cannot open a door of peace before a person.
Explanation: Changing the modal verb "can" to its negative form "cannot" makes the whole sentence negative while keeping the original meaning.

(b) The invitation was accepted by him.
Explanation: In passive voice the object "the invitation" becomes the subject, the verb uses auxiliary "was" + past participle "accepted", and the agent is expressed with "by him."

(c) Reading books is the noblest of all habits.
Explanation: Replace the comparative phrase "nobler than any other" with the superlative form "the noblest" and add "of all" to show it is highest in rank.

(d) What a very essential virtue it is to love one's country!
Explanation: Use the exclamatory "What..." construction plus "it is to..." to turn the statement into an exclamation expressing strong feeling.

(e) We do not measure our lives by months or years.
Explanation: This keeps the active voice with "we" as the subject and corrects to the natural plural "lives," expressing the same negative idea actively.

(f) Industry is more important for success than anything else.
Explanation: Change the superlative "the most important" into a comparative "more important ... than ..." and add a comparison phrase to complete it.

(g) She was very attentive to her studies.
Explanation: Convert the exclamatory "How attentive she was!" into a straightforward declarative sentence to make it assertive.

(h) Terrorism is a very corrosive problem of the modern world.
Explanation: Remove the superlative phrase "one of the most" and use the positive adjective "very corrosive" to express the idea in the positive degree.

(i) Let us do good deeds as our responsibility.
Explanation: Use the imperative-suggestive form "Let us" plus the base verb to turn the sentence into a command/suggestion.

(j) Not everybody is fond of glittering things.
Explanation: Placing "Not" before "everybody" makes the sentence negative without completely reversing the intended scope (unlike "Nobody," which is stronger).

(j) The government is not insincere in removing this crime. (এই অপরাধ দূর করতে সরকার উদাসীন নয়।)

Explanation:
(a) Copying in the exams is one of the greatest social crimes. (Positive Degree)

✅ Transformed: Very few social crimes are as great as copying in the exams.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: “One of the + superlative” → “Very few + plural noun + are as + positive degree + as...”

এখানে "one of the greatest" একটি superlative expression, যেটি positive রূপে রূপান্তর করতে হয় “Very few...” দিয়ে শুরু করে।

(b) It is a very serious crime. (Exclamatory)

✅ Transformed: How serious a crime it is!

📝 Explanation:

Rule: “It is a very + adjective + noun.” → “How + adjective + a + noun + it is!”

এখানে “very serious crime” কে Exclamatory করার জন্য “How” দিয়ে শুরু করে অভিপ্রায় প্রকাশ করা হয়েছে।

(c) A student copying in the exam only deceives himself. (Negative)

✅ Transformed: A student copying in the exam does not deceive anyone but himself.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Affirmative → Negative by using “does not... but” structure

“Only deceives himself” অর্থ বোঝাতে “does not deceive anyone but himself” ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।

(d) Copying in the exam cannot bring any benefit. (Passive)

✅ Transformed: No benefit can be brought by copying in the exam.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Passive Voice: object + auxiliary + be + past participle + by + agent

এখানে “bring” ক্রিয়াটিকে passive করতে “can be brought” করা হয়েছে এবং agent “copying in the exam” যোগ হয়েছে।

(e) What a shameful practice it is! (Assertive)

✅ Transformed: It is a very shameful practice.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Exclamatory → Assertive: “What a/an + adjective + noun it is!” → “It is a very + adjective + noun.”

“What a shameful practice it is!” একটি বিস্ময়বোধক বাক্য, যা assertive এ রূপান্তর করতে "very shameful practice" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।

(f) By resisting this malady, we can strengthen our education. (Passive)

✅ Transformed: Our education can be strengthened by resisting this malady.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Passive: object + can be + past participle + by + agent

"Strengthen" verb-কে passive করতে “can be strengthened” রূপ নেওয়া হয়েছে।

(g) We all should come forward to stop it and save our students. (Imperative)

✅ Transformed: Let us all come forward to stop it and save our students.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Suggestive imperative → “Let us...”

যেহেতু এখানে একটি সমষ্টিগত আহ্বান বা উৎসাহ জ্ঞাপন করা হয়েছে, তাই “Let us...” দিয়ে imperative রূপ করা হয়েছে।

(h) Our examination system should be moderated. (Active)

✅ Transformed: Someone should moderate our examination system.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Passive → Active: subject + modal + base verb + object

“Should be moderated” এর Active রূপ হয় “should moderate” এবং ‘Someone’ একটি অব্যক্ত কর্তা (agent) হিসেবে যুক্ত হয়েছে।

(i) Nothing is as hateful as copying in the exam. (Comparative)

✅ Transformed: Copying in the exam is more hateful than anything else.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Positive → Comparative: “Nothing is as + adjective + as...” → “Subject is more + adjective + than anything else.”

“Nothing is as hateful as...” মানে হলো সবকিছুর চেয়ে এটি বেশি ঘৃণ্য — তাই comparative রূপে প্রকাশ করা হয়েছে।

(j) The government is sincere in removing this crime. (Negative)

✅ Transformed: The government is not insincere in removing this crime.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Affirmative → Negative: “is sincere” → “is not insincere”

Double negative না করে অর্থ অক্ষুন্ন রেখে নেতিবাচক রূপে প্রকাশ করা হয়েছে।

(j) Jackfruits look very beautiful in the trees. (গাছে কাঁঠাল খুব সুন্দর দেখায়।)

Explanation:
Solution:

(a) Jackfruit is a large fruit of Bangladesh.
Explanation: The original superlative phrase "one of the largest" is changed to the positive degree by using the adjective "large" without comparison.

(b) What a very juicy fruit it is!
Explanation: An exclamatory sentence expresses strong feeling; here we use "What a..." structure and an exclamation to show emphasis.

(c) It is considered very sweet.
Explanation: "Taste" as a linking verb does not take a natural passive, so we use "is considered" to form a passive that preserves the original meaning.

(d) It does not contain high calories.
Explanation: To make the sentence negative in the simple present, add the auxiliary "does not" before the base verb.

(e) Does everyone know it as our national fruit?
Explanation: Forming a yes/no question in present simple requires the auxiliary "does" and inversion of subject and verb.

(f) In summer, this fruit is not very available.
Explanation: Make the sentence negative by inserting "not" after the auxiliary verb "is."

(g) People mainly find it in the month of Jaishtha.
Explanation: Change the passive "is found" into an active form by introducing a doer ("people") and using the active verb "find."

(h) It is less costly than the mango.
Explanation: "Not as...as" is changed to a comparative form "less...than" to compare the two items directly.

(i) Eat the fruit to ensure nutrition.
Explanation: An imperative sentence gives a command or advice; remove the subject and use the base verb "eat."

(j) Jackfruits look very beautiful in the trees.
Explanation: Convert the exclamatory sentence into a plain assertive (declarative) sentence by stating the observation without exclamation.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Changing Sentences:

(a) I know the student. (আমি ছাত্রটিকে চিনি।)

(b) An interesting book was given to me by her. (তার দ্বারা আমাকে একটি মজার বই দেওয়া হয়েছিল।)

(c) Magura is not as old as Jashore. (মাগুরা যশোরের মতো পুরাতন নয়।)

(d) Truthfulness is better than any other quality of a person. (সত্যবাদিতা একজন ব্যক্তির অন্য যেকোনো গুণের চেয়ে উত্তম।)

(e) Dhaka is the most populous city in Bangladesh. (ঢাকা বাংলাদেশের সবচেয়ে জনবহুল শহর।)

(f) My friend is never late. (আমার বন্ধু কখনও দেরি করে না।)'

(g) What a fool he is! (সে কতই না বোকা।)

(h) The student is very bright. (ছাত্রটি খুব মেধাবী।)

(i) Let us obey our teachers. (চলো আমরা শিক্ষকদের মান্য করি।)

(j) Let your health be taken care of. (তোমার স্বাস্থ্যের যত্ন নেওয়া হোক।)

Explanation:
(a) I know the student.
The passive "is known to me" is changed to active by making the agent "I" the subject and using the active verb "know".

(b) An interesting book was given to me by her.
To form the passive, the object "an interesting book" becomes the subject, the verb becomes "was given" and the agent is introduced with "by her".

(c) Jashore is not as young as Magura.
To convert a comparative to the positive form we use "not as + positive adjective + as" so "older than" becomes "not as young as" to keep the same meaning.

(d) Truthfulness is better than any other quality of a person.
"Best" (superlative) changes to comparative by saying "better than any other…" to compare truthfulness with all other qualities.

(e) Dhaka is the most populous city in Bangladesh.
To form the superlative we make the thing compared the subject and use "the most + adjective" to show it exceeds all others.

(f) My friend is never late.
"Always punctual" is expressed negatively by using the opposite adjective ("late") with "never" to keep the same meaning.

(g) What a great fool he is!
Exclamatory sentences with a noun phrase use the structure "What a + adjective + noun + subject + verb" to show strong feeling.

(h) The student is very bright.
An exclamatory "How bright the student is!" becomes an assertive statement by using "very" with the adjective.

(i) Obey your teachers.
To make an imperative, remove "we should" and use the base verb "Obey" addressed to the listener as a command.

(j) Let your health be taken care of.
The imperative "Take care of your health" is made passive by making "your health" the subject and using "let … be + past participle" to retain the command sense.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) "a", (b) "on", (c) — (no word; "craves change"), (d) "at", (e) "with", (f) "with", (g) "a", (h) "the", (i) "the", (j) "a".  
Use "a" for singular countable nouns ("a great influence", "a lot of"), "on" and "with" are the standard prepositions after "influence" and "come in contact", and "at" shows a reaction to a sight.  
"Craves" normally takes a direct object (no preposition), and "moves with (the) observant eyes" means he travels being observant; "the" is used to specify "world" and "opportunity".

Explanation:
(a) use "a very" because "important issue" is a singular count noun and needs the article "a", with "very" adding emphasis; (b) use "such as" to introduce an example (COVID-19); (c) use "an absolute" because "must" is used as a noun and needs the determiner "an" before a vowel sound to show strong necessity.  
(d) "before" and (e) "after" are correct because they show time relations (prior to eating, after using the toilet); (f) use "of" in "members of our family"; (g) "from" is used in "coming back from outside"; (h) use "the" in "in the proper way" to specify the correct manner.

(a) with; (b) a; (c) for/to; (d) The; (e) around/ of; (f) ×; (g) the; (h) of; (i) ×; (j) for.

Explanation:
Explanation:
ক "with" — "beset with" is the correct collocation meaning afflicted by many problems.
খ "a" — "a great threat" needs the indefinite article before a singular count noun.
গ "to" — threats act "to" or "to the benefit/harm of" something, so "threat to our environment."
ঘ "The" — specific used poly bags already mentioned, so the definite article "The" is required.
ঙ "in" — low-lying areas located inside towns/cities, so "in the towns and the cities."
চ "the" — a specific body of dirty water is meant, so the definite article "the" is used.
ছ "the" — "the fertility" refers to the specific fertility of our soil, so use the definite article.
জ "of" — production "of poly bags" is the correct prepositional phrase.
ঝ "very" — intensifier modifying "dishonest" (alternative acceptable: no word, but "very" emphasizes degree).
ঞ "in" — "in their own interest" is the correct idiomatic phrase.

It may lead (e)----- fear and hatred of the person who punishes (f)----- child. Again, if (g)----- child is punished, it may lack initiative. It may also feel hostile (h)------ others. So, rude (i)----- behaviour gradually develops (j)----- him.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) of; (b) on; (c) x; (d) a; (e) to; (f) the; (g) a; (h) to; (i) ×; (j) in.

Explanation:
Being "conscious" takes the preposition "of" and harm affects someone "on" them, so (a) = "of the" and (b) = "on". "Both" is followed by the article when referring to specific kinds, and we need "the" for the child's possession, so (c) = "the" and (d) = "the"; "lead to" is the correct verb-preposition collocation, so (e) = "to", and a specific punished child takes "the" at (f) = "the". For a general statement use "a" at (g) = "a"; someone feels "hostile to" others so (h) = "to"; finally, negative traits are described as "rude and bad behaviour" and behavior develops "in" a person, so (i) = "and bad" and (j) = "in".

Solution:
(a) a; (b) the; (c) in; (d) ×; (e) of; (f) a; (g) ×; (h) for; (i) of; (j) between.

Explanation:
(a) and (f) use the indefinite article "a" because "great human virtue" and "social being" are singular countable nouns; (b) uses "the" because it refers to that specific love between two persons.  
Prepositions: "in a" (c) shows being within a relationship, "in" (e) fits the phrase "in life", "between" (j) expresses relation of two people, and "with" (i) links people who have similar tastes.  
Possessive "their" (d) shows shared feelings; "some" (g) is idiomatic for wanting company; "for" (h) is required after "yearns" (yearns for).
