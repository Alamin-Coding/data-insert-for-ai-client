Question:
Honesty is (a) — to be (b) — best policy. An honest man never (c) — from the path (d) — morality. He is (e) — by (f) — but hated by (g) — (h) — enemies believe and respect an (i) — and truthful man. So, it is our duty to remain honest (j) — our life.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) said/known/thought/considered; (b) the; (c) deviates/detaches; (d) of/called; (e) loved/respected/honoured/believed/liked; (f) all/everybody/everyone/anyone/anybody; (g) none/nobody; (h) Even/The; (i) honest; (j) in.

Explanation:
The phrase "Honesty is said to be the best policy" uses the fixed passive "said to be" and the definite article "the"; "strays from the path of morality" uses the correct verb + preposition ("stray from") and the possessive "of"; "admired by many but hated by some" is a natural contrast, "Some enemies..." introduces that contrast again, "honest and truthful" are the correct adjectives, and "throughout our life" correctly expresses duration. These choices follow normal English collocations and grammar, so they clearly convey that honesty is recommended and should be maintained for life.

Explanation:
Each blank is chosen for correct meaning and common collocation: (a) "maker" fits because it means one who creates his fate; (b) "use" completes the fixed phrase "make proper use of time"; (c) "diligently" or "regularly" matches doing duties with steady effort; (d) "prosper" (or "succeed") is the logical result. The remaining words follow idiomatic pairs—(e) "use" (referring to time), (f) "fail", (g) "doomed"/"condemned" with (h) "existence" ("drag a miserable existence"), (i) "fatal" and (j) "but" ("nothing but the sum total")—all chosen for sense and common usage.

Explanation:
(a) in — "Do well in the examination" uses [math]"in"[/math] to show success within the exam.  
(b) an — Use [math]"an"[/math] before a word beginning with a vowel sound like "easy."  
(c) hard — "Work hard" is the correct collocation meaning to put in effort.  
(d) beginning — "From the very beginning" is a fixed phrase meaning the start of the year.  
(e) textbooks — "Textbooks" are the books students should read again and again.  
(f) without — "Memorize answers without understanding" needs [math]"without"[/math] to show absence of understanding.  
(g) from — "Make notes from a common source" uses [math]"from"[/math] to indicate origin.  
(h) of — "A good command of English" uses [math]"of"[/math] to show the language possessed.  
(i) these — "All these things" refers to the actions just listed, so [math]"these"[/math] is correct.  
(j) an — Use [math]"an"[/math] before the vowel sound in "excellent" (an excellent result).

(g) — it is a suicidal attempt. (h) — we do not stop (i) — acts, soon our country will , no doubt , turn (j) — a desert.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) useful/important/significant/essential/beneficial/conducive; (b) with; (c) us/men/people; (d) prevent/control/protect; (e) the; (f) indiscriminately/aimlessly/irrationally/unwisely: (g) but/ though; (h) If; (i) such/these; (j) into.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) useful, (b) with, (c) us, (d) prevent, (e) the, (f) down, (g) Indeed, (h) If, (i) these, (j) into.  
These choices fit both meaning and grammar: "useful" describes the benefit to man; verbs like "provide" and "supply" require the preposition "with" and the recipient "us"; "cut down" is the correct phrasal verb, and "turn into" is the correct collocation for becoming a desert.  
"The" is the definite article before "importance", "prevent" expresses stopping drought/flood, "Indeed" emphasizes the warning, and "If we do not stop these acts" correctly introduces the conditional.

Again there will be no rain and as a result the country will face a great crises because ours is (e) — agricultural country and our economy is dependent on (f) —. Again our agriculture (g) — on rain.

Solution:
(a) on; (b) at; (c) into; (d) effect; (e) an; (f) agriculture; (g) depends; (h) great/significant/big; (i) from; (j) calamities/disasters.

Explanation:
Explanation: 
(a) "on" is the correct collocation: we say "impact on the climate." (b) "at random" means without order or plan. (c) "into" shows change of state: turn into a desert. (d) "effect" completes the common phrase "greenhouse effect." (e) "an" is the correct article before the vowel-starting noun "agricultural country." (f) "agriculture" is what the economy depends on. (g) "depends" agrees with the singular subject "our agriculture." (h) "positive" describes the beneficial effect of trees. (i) "from" shows protection: "save us from flood." (j) "disasters" is the suitable plural noun for many natural calamities.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা: এখানে "one of the most"–এর সাথে বিশেষণবাচক সর্বোচ্চ রূপ বোঝাতে নির্দিষ্ট আর্টিকেল "the" লাগে, আর জীবনে কিছু নির্দেশ করতে "in human life" এ preposition "in" প্রয়োজন। "A sound man cannot go without sleeping"–এ "a" অনির্দিষ্ট আর্টিকেল এবং "without" দিয়ে বোঝানো হয়েছে তাড়া/অপসারণ ছাড়া থাকা সম্ভব নয়। "the healing medicine of the troubled mind"–এ নির্দিষ্ট ঔষধ বোঝাতে "the" এবং অনুভব বা মনের জন্য "mind" ব্যবহার করা ঠিক; শেষে "indifferent to his work and responsibilities"–এ "to" প্রিপোজিশন ও "work" নামে বস্তুগত শব্দ প্রয়োজন।

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) "number" — the phrase "a great number of" correctly quantifies a plural noun ("people") to mean many.  
(b) "the" — "the world" is a specific, fixed phrase: "all over the world."  
(c) "it" — a pronoun referring to "English": "use it as a first language."  
(d) "a" — the indefinite article is required before "second language."  
(e) "rely" — "rely on" is the correct verb–preposition collocation meaning depend on English.  
(f) "countries" — plural noun fits because offices are in various countries.  
(g) "in" — the correct preposition for where advertisements are published: "published in newspapers."  
(h) "command" — the collocation "a good command (of/over) English" means strong ability or control.

Question:
The Eiffel Tower was named (a) — Gustavo Effiel, a Frenchman who built (b) — Tower. He graduated from the Central School of Engineering in Paris and went to work for a railway (c) — company. For years Gustave made plan (d) — plan of dams, factories, stations and structures of great size. All (e) — Europe engineers copied them. In the middle of 1880 a group of French industrialists persuade the government to organize (f) — World’s Fair (g) — Paris. Gustave Eiffel proposed a 989 foot tower of iron as symbol of the (h) —. Forty engineers and designers under Eiffel’s (i) — worked for two years. It was (j) — highest structure yet made by man.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) after; (b) the/this/that/the Eiffel Tower; (c) construction/engineering; (d) after; (e) over/ the/around/of; (f) a/the; (g) in; (h) fair/exhibition; (i) direction; (j) the.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) after, (b) the, (c) construction, (d) after, (e) over, (f) the, (g) in, (h) Exposition (or Fair), (i) direction, (j) the.

Use 'after' with "named" to show who it was named for, and "plan after plan" is an idiom meaning repeated plans; 'construction' and 'direction' are noun forms describing the type of company and Eiffel's leadership. 'Over' in "all over Europe" means throughout the region, 'in' shows location ("in Paris"), and 'the' is required before specific things (the World's Fair) and before superlatives (the highest).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) letters/wisdom; (b) even; (c) works/contributions/deeds/actions; (d) educated/honest/ important/ideal; (e) spreading/imparting; (f) teaches/advises/encourages; (g) differentiate/ distinguish; (h) In; (i) whom; (j) respect/honour.

Explanation:
The phrase "a man of good character" uses a noun phrase after "of" to describe his quality; "even" fits before "after his death" to show respect continues, and "good deeds" names the reason for that respect. "Ideal" correctly labels a model person; "promoting education" (a gerund phrase) shows his purpose, while "teaches" is the proper transitive verb and "distinguish between" is the correct collocation for separating right and wrong. "In fact" introduces a confirming remark; "whom" is the object of "should emulate," and "emulate" means to imitate or follow his example.

Since we are not (e) — of the gravity of the problem, we cannot take steps to increase our (f) — rate. As a result, we are (g) — behind. We have to depend (h) — the foreign aids. So, all should come forward (i) — to remove illiteracy. Then, the (j) — of our country will be possible.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) a; (b) curse; (c) of; (d) harm/problems; (e) conscious/aware; (f) literacy: (g) lagging; (h) on/upon; (i) unitedly/in order/jointly/combinedly; (j) progress/development/prosperity.

Explanation:
Explanation:
a "a" — the article is needed: "not a boon" is the correct phrase before a singular noun.
b "curse" — contrasts with "boon" and correctly conveys severe negative impact.
c "of" — fixed phrase "all kinds of development" requires the preposition "of".
d "harm" — "causes great harm" is the natural collocation for negative effects.
e "aware" — we say "not aware of the gravity" to mean lacking understanding of the problem’s seriousness.
f "literacy" — "literacy rate" is the standard term for the measure being increased.
g "falling" — the phrase "falling behind" correctly describes losing progress compared to others.
h "on" — the verb phrase is "depend on" (something).
i "in" — "come forward in removing illiteracy" fits the sentence; it means actively participate in the effort.
j "progress" — "the progress of our country" naturally expresses the desired positive outcome.

Question:
Time is very (a) —. Time which is lost once is lost forever. There is a proverb that time and tide (b) — for none. It is time which does not have any relative feelings. If it is not used (c) —, one must suffer (d) — the long run. (e) — the other hand we can go a long way (f) — realizing the value of time. Those who have become great have made (g) — use of time. They never put (h) — their work (i) — tomorrow. As a result, they have (j) — top position in society. So it is our duty to follow them.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) valuable/important/precious; (b) wait; (c) properly/sincerely/rightly/appropriately/wisely; (d) in; (e) On; (f) by/on/after; (g) proper/the; (h) off; (i) for; (j) assumed/achieved/secured/ reached/ gained/obtained.

Explanation:
"precious" is the natural collocation for time, and the proverb uses the base verb "wait" ("time and tide wait for none").  
"If it is not used" takes the adverb "properly" and we "suffer in the long run"; "On the other hand" is the fixed phrase and we say "go a long way by" + gerund.  
"made good use of" is the correct collocation, "put off" is the phrasal verb for postponing followed by "till" (or "until") tomorrow, and "attained" correctly describes achieving a top position.

Explanation:
Explanation: Choose words that fit both meaning and grammar of each blank.

a "enemy" fits the meaning; b "out" completes "driven out"; c "the" is the definite article before "English"; d "his" makes "his men"; e "an" is the correct article before the vowel-starting "unfortunate".

f "for" shows purpose; g "in" fits "in despair"; h "sitting" describes his action in the cave; i "up" completes "give up"; j "in" correctly forms "successful in its attempt."

Explanation:
Answers: (a) riser, (b) the, (c) in, (d) do, (e) On, (f) a, (g) in, (h) in, (i) it a, (j) rising.  
"Early riser" is the correct collocation; "the" specifies the particular fresh air, and "in the morning" requires the preposition "in"; "do" fits the verb phrase "do his work properly."  
"On the other hand" is the fixed contrast phrase; "a man" needs the indefinite article; both occurrences of "in" are the correct preposition ("in sleep", "in doing"); "make it a habit" is a fixed expression and "rising" is a gerund (noun) meaning waking early.

The sentence contrasts the consequences of lateness with the benefits of timely study, so words like "student" and "late" fit because a late pupil misses parts of lessons and therefore often lags behind, while verbs like "prepare/study" and the adverb "well" show that timely study leads to good exam results. "Punctuality is the key to success" is a fixed, grammatical phrase—hence "the" and "to" fit those blanks—and the final advice uses "should" and "in" to form "We all should be punctual in our day-to-day life." Choose words that both make grammatical sense and follow the logical cause–effect sequence: lateness → missed learning → poor performance; punctuality → timely preparation → success.

Explanation:
Explanation:
ক "science" — The sentence names the era we live in; "age of science" is the natural phrase meaning a period dominated by scientific progress.
খ "the" — "the influence of science" is definite and specific, so the definite article "the" is required.
গ "part" — "a constant part of our daily life" correctly expresses that science is always present in everyday activities.
ঘ "made" — "We have made the impossible things possible" uses the verb "made" to show that people caused that change.
ঙ "of" — The phrase is "by means of science," so the preposition "of" completes the expression "by means of."
চ "product" — "The modern civilization is a product of science" correctly shows civilization resulting from scientific development.
ছ "easily" — "At present we can easily travel" fits naturally to show travel is now simple.
জ "In" — "In ancient times journey was difficult" needs the preposition "In" to indicate that past period.
ঝ "people" — Referring to those in ancient times, "people had to spend..." is the appropriate subject.
ঞ "time" — "had to spend much time and money" correctly pairs "time" with "money" as things required for travelling.

The goose laid a (e) —- egg everyday. In a few months he became rich. But he was a (f) —- greedy man. He thought that there (g) —- more eggs in the belly of the goose. He wanted to get all the eggs (h) —- a time. So one day, he killed the goose and cut its belly open with (i) —- knife. But alas! there was no egg. Thus the greedy farmer (j) —- the useful goose.

Solution:
(a) a; (b) because; (c) for/of; (d) a; (e) golden; (f) very; (g) were/would be; (h) at; (i) a; (j) lost/killed.

Explanation:
Explanation: 'a' is used before singular countable nouns, so (a), (d) and (i) are "a poor man", "a wonderful goose", "a knife". 'Because' gives the reason in (b), 'for' shows purpose in (c) ("land for cultivation"), 'golden' describes the egg in (e), and 'very' intensifies 'greedy' in (f). 'Were' agrees with the plural 'eggs' in (g), 'at' completes the phrase "at a time" in (h), and 'killed' correctly describes the action done to the goose in (j).

Options:

Solution:
(a) architect/maker/founder/builder; (b) use/division; (c) properly/accordingly; (d) prosper/ shine/succeed; (e) otherwise; (f) repent/regret; (g) have/be submitted/be bound; (h) from; (i) to; (j) but.

Explanation:
a architect; b use; c well; d prosper; e otherwise; f repent; g have to; h from; i to; j but.  
These words fit both meaning and grammar: "architect" means one who shapes his fate; "use of time" is the correct collocation and "well" is the adverb for "does his duties"; "prosper" matches "improve and ___ in life"; "otherwise" contrasts the two cases and "repent" expresses late regret; "have to" shows the unavoidable consequence, "from day-to-day" is the idiom, "to shorten" requires the infinitive, and "nothing but" means "only."  
Overall idea: proper use of time and dutiful work lead to success, while wasting time brings late regret and a miserable life.

ক জন্মগত — দেশপ্রেম সাধারণত মানুষের মধ্যে স্বভাবতই থাকে, তাই এটি “জন্মগত” মানে প্রকৃত উপযুক্ত।  

খ ইতিহাস — প্রাচীন উপজাতিগুলোও জন্মভূমির প্রেম পেত, তাই দেশপ্রেম লেখচিত্র বা নথি হওয়ার আগেও অর্থাৎ ইতিহাসের চেয়েও পুরোনো।

ঝ সংকীর্ণ — সীমিত বা অন্যদের বিরোধী হওয়া জাতীয়তাবাদ খারাপ; তাই “সংকীর্ণ” দেশপ্রেম নিন্দনীয়।  

ঞ দূর করে ফেলতে — বাক্যটি কাউকে মনের ভেতর থেকে সেই নেতিবাচক মনোভাব “দূর করে ফেলতে” বলছে, অর্থাৎ তা ত্যাগ করতে হবে।

Ans. (a) bookish; (b) competitive; (c) enrich; (d) burning; (e) newspaper; (f) well; (g) current; (h) cannot; (i) water; (j) knowledge.

Explanation:
These words fit both meaning and grammar: 'bookish' contrasts with the practical demands of the 'modern' world; newspapers 'enrich' a student's general knowledge and make him aware of 'current' issues; the proverb needs 'newspapers' and 'well' (a frog in a narrow well), and being ignorant of 'national' affairs he 'cannot' take part in discussions and feels like a fish out of 'water'; finally 'knowledge' correctly completes the idea of widening one's range.

Many factors are (e) —for road accidents. The most common cause is (f) — driving. Sometimes they drive night coach (g) — on the same day. The drivers do not check the engines (h) — before they start driving. The roads are two-lane roads (i) — any dividers. These are some of the (j) — reasons of road accidents in Bangladesh.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) use "a" because "regular phenomenon" is a singular count noun and needs an article; (c) and (j) use adjectives like "major"/"main" to show the seriousness.  
(b) "in" is the correct preposition with "die" and "road accidents"; (d) "various" or "many" fits because multiple causes exist; (e) "responsible" commonly collocates with "for" (f) "reckless" or "careless" describes the driving cause; (g) "as well" (or "also") shows they do both shifts on the same day; (h) "properly" is an adverb modifying "check"; (i) "without" expresses the absence of dividers.

The cost of construction is (f) — day by day. At present it is very (g) — for the (h) — people to (i) — the cost of construction. So, this problem (j) — to be solved soon.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Correct words were chosen to fit both grammar and meaning: "problems" for (a) because "one of the greatest" requires a plural noun; "cities" for (b) since Dhaka and Chattogram are cities; "live" for (c) as the verb describing people on footpaths; "areas" for (d) because "rural areas" is the usual phrase; and "shortage" for (e) because we say an "acute shortage" of housing.  
"increasing" for (f) matches "cost ... day by day"; "difficult" for (g) and "poor" for (h) fit the phrase "difficult for the poor people"; "afford" for (i) is the correct verb with "cost"; and "needs" for (j) correctly completes "needs to be solved soon."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
ক "cultivating" নির্বাচন করা হয়েছে কারণ বাক্যে বিদেশি সবজি চাষ করার আগ্রহ বোঝাতে ক্রিয়ার প্রয়োজন এবং "interest in cultivating" হল সঠিক collocation।  
খ "to" সঠিক কারণ "add dimensions to" একটি স্থায়ী ইংরেজি প্রবাদবাক্য — কোনো কিছুকে অন্য কিছুর উপর প্রভাবিত বা সংযোজন হিসেবে বলা হয়।  
গ "young farmer" উপযুক্ত কারণ প্রসঙ্গে নতুন ও উদ্ভাবনী ফসল চাষকারী যুবককে নির্দেশ করা হচ্ছে।  
ঘ "dream" রাখা হয়েছে কারণ কোনো ব্যাক্তি সাধারণত একটি স্বপ্ন বা লক্ষ্য নিয়েই খামার শুরু করে; এখানে ধারণাগত অনুপ্রেরণা বোঝাতে এটি মানানসই।  
ঙ "commercial" ফার্ম মানে বাণিজ্যিকভাবে পরিচালিত খামার, যেটা বিদেশি উদ্ভিদগুলোর ব্যাপক চাষের বাস্তব প্রতিফলন।  
চ "exotic" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে কারণ curry leaves, lemongrass, broccoli ইত্যাদি দেশের প্রচলিত সবজির থেকে ভিন্ন বা বিদেশি—অর্থাৎ "exotic" মানায়।  
ছ "in" প্রয়োজন কারণ এখানে বলা হচ্ছে বিদেশি ফসলের চাষ ঘটছে আমাদের দেশের মধ্যে: "cultivation of foreign crops in our country"।  
জ "local" সঙ্গত কারণ বাক্যে স্থানীয় কৃষকরা এবং গ্রাহকদের উভয়কেই অনুপ্রাণিত করে—সুতরাং "local farmers" মানানসই।  
ঝ "diet" নেওয়া হয়েছে কারণ এখানে নিয়মিত খাদ্যাভ্যাস ও পুষ্টি সম্পর্কে বলা হচ্ছে, তাই "diet" শব্দটি পুরোপুরি মেলে।  
ঞ "export" উপযুক্ত কারণ মানসম্মত উৎপাদন ও প্যাকেজিং নিশ্চিত করলে ওই সবজি বিদেশে বিক্রি করা যায়—অর্থাৎ রপ্তানি করা সম্ভব।

Question:
A true friend is (a) — asset. He stands (b) — his friends in time (c) — danger. He is not (d) — greedy person. He (e) — wishes for the welfare of (f) — friend. But it is a matter of (g) — regret that a true friend is very (h) — today. A selfish man cannot be a (i) — friend. He always thinks of his (j) — interest.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A true friend is an asset. He stands by his friend in time of the danger. Normally he is not a greedy person. He always wishes for the welfare of his friends. But it is a matter of fact that an ideal friend is very rare today.

Explanation:

In the above sentences, the correct use of articles is to be mentioned.
There are three articles used in English Grammar.
'A', 'an' and 'the' are the three articles.
They are used with the nouns to specify their definiteness in the sentences.
'The' is the definite article.
'A' and 'an' are the indefinite articles.
'A' is used with words beginning with a consonant sound.
'An' is used with words beginning with a vowel sound.

Explanation:
Answers: a valuable, b by, c of, d a, e always, f his, g great, h rare, i true, j own. 

Reason: these choices fit common English collocations and grammar—'valuable' describes an asset, we say 'stand by' and 'time of', articles/possessives ('a', 'his', 'own') complete the noun phrases, 'always' shows habitual action, and 'great regret' + 'rare' and 'true' contrast correctly with 'selfish'.

In the textbooks all the topics are designed as per students’ grade that ensures (c) — complete sense. In case (d) — not reading those texts a student will miss (e) — needed for him or her. Moreover, textbooks are (f) — and edited by highly experienced educationists. Some students ignore (g) — read text books rather they prefer guidebooks. But merely (h) — guidebooks keeps the students ignoble of the subject matter as they are written focusing on exam result (i) — a textbook covers all the details for holistic flourish (j) — a student.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: The correct words follow basic grammar patterns — "essential" takes the preposition "for" (a), "expect" is followed by the infinitive "to" (b), and a singular noun phrase needs the article "a" before "complete sense" (c). "In case of" (d) is the fixed phrase, "what is" (e) introduces the object clause the student will miss, and "written" (f) parallels "edited" as past participles describing textbooks. After verbs like "ignore" we use the gerund "reading" (g), "relying on" (h) is the correct phrasal verb, "whereas" (i) shows contrast, and "of" (j) indicates the relationship/possession ("flourish of a student").

Solution:
Gap filling with suitable words:

(a) wide; (b) second; (c) compulsory; (d) learn; (e) reasons; (f) continuous; (g) writing; (h) yocabulary; (i) environment; (j) across.

Explanation:
(a) wide — "world-wide" is a common compound; "wide" completes "world-wide importance" meaning global importance.  
(b) second — "the second language" fits here because English is an additional language after the mother tongue.  
(c) compulsory — "compulsory subject" means it is required study from class I to XII.  
(d) speak — context refers to ability to use the language orally, so "speak well" is correct.  
(e) reasons — "there are so many reasons behind it" uses the plural noun "reasons."  
(f) proper — "proper development of the syllabus" is the correct collocation meaning suitable or adequate development.  
(g) writing — exams are described as being based on written ability, so "writing skill" fits.  
(h) practice — lack of regular practice explains poor performance, so "practice" is appropriate.  
(i) opportunities — "English-speaking opportunities" means chances to use the language, which are lacking.  
(j) throughout — "throughout the country" correctly means all over the country, indicating a nationwide shortage.

Explanation:
Explanation: The passage talks about what an examination does and its consequences, so (a) "assess" or "test" fits because an exam measures academic knowledge, and (b) "students" (or "candidates") are the people being assessed. (c) "fair" or "impartial" is required for correctness, and the authority must (d) "administer" or "supervise" it in the best (e) "manner" or "way" — these words fit both grammar and meaning. Cheating "in the exam" (f) is an offence because it (g) "lowers" or "undermines" the standard of education, and (h) "in consequence of" students' failure to (i) "acquire" or "receive" true education, the nation will (j) "suffer" greatly — each choice matches the intended sense and sentence structure.

Explanation:
(a) "era", (b) "ambitious" and (c) "without" fit because "opened a new era" is a common collocation, the bridge is a large-scale (ambitious) project, and "implemented without any foreign aid" is grammatically correct.  
(d) "off" and (e) "in" are correct because areas are "cut off" (phrasal verb) and we say "keep pace with the other parts in economic development."  
(f) "trade" and (g) "communication" work since bridges "expand trade and commerce" and speed up communication/transport.  
(h) "growth", (i) "poverty" and (j) "dream" fit common collocations: "economic growth", "reduce the poverty" and "long‑cherished dream" which "came true."
