Question:
mr. hasan is a renowned english teacher has been teaching in our school for the past five years he is honest and sincere he is our favourite teacher we love him much

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Mr. Hasan is a renowned English teacher; has been teaching in our school for the past five years. He is honest and sincere. He is our favourite teacher. We love him much.

[Note: In a compound sentence if there is no coordinating conjunction, we can use (;) instead of coordinating conjunction. Ref: Wren and Martin]

Explanation:
Correct sentence: "Mr. Hasan is a renowned English teacher. He has been teaching in our school for the past five years. He is honest and sincere. He is our favourite teacher; we love him very much." Capitalization is needed for the title and proper noun ("Mr.", "Hasan") and the language name ("English"), sentences must be separated with proper punctuation, and "very much" is the natural idiom rather than "much."

Question:
the king said what harm did i do then that you should seek to take my life with your own hand you killed my father and my two brothers the young man replied

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The king said, "What harm did I do then that you should seek to take my life with your own hand?" "You killed my father and my two brothers," the young man replied.

Explanation:
The correct punctuation is: "The king said, 'What harm did I do, then, that you should seek to take my life with your own hand?'" "You killed my father and my two brothers," the young man replied.  
This is correct because direct speech must be placed in quotation marks and the pronoun [math]I[/math] and the first word of a quoted sentence are capitalized.  
Also, a question mark stays inside the quotation for the king's question, and a comma is used before the closing quotation mark when a dialogue tag (the young man replied) follows.

Question:

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Is there anybody here who has ever crossed a river by a boat?" "I have, teacher. I clearly remember what happened in that journey," said Jamal.

Explanation:
The correct form replaces the wrong words and fixes punctuation and capitalization: "Is there anybody here who has ever crossed a river by boat?" "I have, teacher; I clearly remember what happened in that journey," said Jarnal.  
Use [math]ever[/math] with the present perfect to ask about past experience, always capitalize the pronoun [math]I[/math] and names, and punctuate direct speech so the reporting clause (said Jarnal) follows proper comma/quotation rules.

Question:
why are you going to borisal said father i want to buy some important books said saad do you need money yes father don’t go alone as time is not going well

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Why are you going to Barishal?" said father. "I want to buy some important books," said Sa'ad. "Do you need money?" Yes, father." "Don't go alone as time is not going well."

Explanation:
The correct version uses quotation marks around each speaker’s words and the right end punctuation: questions get question marks inside the quotes ("Why are you going to Borsal?"), statements get commas before the reporting verb ("I want to buy some important books," said Saad). Capitalize the first word of the quoted sentence, but common nouns like "father" stay lowercase unless used as a name. Placing reporting verbs (said/asked) after the quoted speech makes who is speaking clear.

Question:
once my mother said to me who came to you my friend rafiq mom she asked what did he want i said his mother is ill he needs some money i have given him five hundred taka my mother said wonderful

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Once my mother said to me, "Who came to you?" "My friend, Rafiq, Mom." She asked, "What did he want?" I said, "His mother is ill. He needs some money. I have given him five hundred taka." My mother said, "Wonderful!"

Explanation:
This passage is converted into reported speech, so verbs shift back (present → past, past → past perfect where needed), pronouns are adjusted, and quotation marks are removed. Thus "his mother is ill; he needs some money; I have given him five hundred taka" becomes "his mother was ill; he needed some money; I had given him five hundred taka," and "my mother said wonderful" becomes "my mother said it was wonderful."

Question:

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Robert Bruce, the king of Scotland, was defeated at a war and failed to regain his country's freedom several times. Naturally he was in a very dejected mood. Sitting in his hideout, he lost himself in deep thought.

Explanation:
The correct answer is right because repeated defeats and failed attempts naturally make the king feel sad and hopeless, and his sitting alone in a hideout and losing himself in deep thought shows a brooding, dejected mood. From context clues—defeat, isolation, and inward reflection—we infer his emotional state (dejection/pensiveness).

"Where are you going now?" Karim said. "I am going to hospital. My brother is ill. I've to stay with him in the hospital." ("আপনি এখন কোথায় যাচ্ছেন?" করিম বলল। "আমি হাসপাতালে যাচ্ছি। আমার ভাই অসুস্থ। আমাকে তার সাথে হাসপাতালে থাকতে হবে।")

Explanation:
"Where are you going now, Karim?" I said. "I am going to the hospital. My brother is ill. I have to stay with him in the hospital."

Use a question mark for the direct question and a comma before the name being addressed (vocative), end statements with periods and capitalize "I"; also prefer "I have to" and "the hospital" for standard English.

once my mother said to me who came to you my friend rafiq mom she asked what did he want i said his mother is ill he needs some money i have given him five hundred taka my mother said wonderful

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Punctuation :

Once my mother said to me, "Who came to you?" "My friend Rafiq, mom." She asked, "What did he want?" I said, "His mother is ill. He needs some money. I have given him five hundred taka." My mother said, "Wonderful!” (একবার আমার মা আমাকে বললেন, "তোমার কাছে কে এসেছিলো?" "আমার বন্ধু, রফিক, মা।" তিনি জিজ্ঞেস করলেন, "সে কী চেয়েছিল?” আমি বললাম, "তার মা অসুস্থ। তার কিছু টাকা দরকার। আমি তাকে পাঁচশ টাকা দিয়েছি।" মা বললেন, "চমৎকার!")

Explanation:
Capitalize the first word of each sentence and proper nouns (e.g., "Rafiq"), enclose spoken words in quotation marks and use commas to introduce them (She asked, "What did he want?"), and use question marks for direct questions and periods for statements. Also separate clauses with commas where needed (I said, "His mother is ill; he needs some money.") to make the meaning clear.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Punctuation:

"Why are you putting the foods in your pocket, sir? Why don't you eat?" asked the nobleman.."I'm doing the right thing. My dress deserves these rich dishes," replied Sheikh Sa'adi. "I'm sorry. I don't understand what you mean to say," said the nobleman. ("আপনি খাবারগুলো পকেটে রাখছেন কেন, স্যার? আপনি খান না কেন?” সম্ভ্রান্ত লোকটি জিজ্ঞেস করলেন। "আমি ঠিক কাজটি করছি। আমার পোশাক এই উন্নতমানের/দামি খাবারের যোগ্য," শেখ সা'দী উত্তর দিলেন। "আমি দুঃখিত। আমি বুঝতে পারছি না আপনি কী বলতে চাচ্ছেন," সম্ভ্রান্ত লোকটি বললেন।)

Explanation:
The correct version encloses each spoken sentence in quotation marks and places the punctuation (question mark, comma, or period) inside those quotes, with a comma before the dialogue tag when the tag follows a quotation (e.g., "Why are you putting the foods in your pocket, sir?" asked the nobleman). Each new speaker begins a new sentence so attributions like "asked the nobleman" or "replied Sheikh Sa'adi" are clearly separated from the quoted speech, making the dialogue clear and grammatically correct.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Punctuation:

Mainul Islam is a qualified farmer in Naogaon. He lives in his village with his two brothers. When he was asked, "What makes you decide to stay here in this village?" He replied, "Look, it's true that we could leave this village for a city life, but it didn't attract us." (মইনুল ইসলাম নওগাঁর একজন দক্ষ কৃষক। তিনি তার দুই ভাইকে নিয়ে গ্রামে থাকেন। যখন তাকে জিজ্ঞেস করা হল, "কী আপনাকে এই গ্রামে থাকতে সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়ায়?" তিনি উত্তর দিলেন, "দেখুন, এটা সত্য যে আমরা শহরের জীবনের জন্য এই গ্রাম ছেড়ে যেতে পারতাম, কিন্তু এটি আমাদের আকর্ষণ করেনি।")

Explanation:
Punctuation clarifies sentence boundaries and speech: use periods for statements, commas after introductory phrases and to separate clauses, a question mark for direct questions, quotation marks for spoken words, and apostrophes for contractions. Correctly punctuated: When he was asked, "What makes you decide to stay here in this village?" he replied, "Look, it's true that we could leave this village for a city life, but it didn't attract us."

My dear friends I am here to tell you about an important discovery said the cunning fox I have discovered that our tails are unnecessary How strange Is it unnecessary said the other foxes

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Punctuation:

"My dear friends, I am here to tell you about an important discovery," said the cunning fox. "I have discovered that our tails are unnecessary." "How strange! Is it unnecessary?" said the other foxes. ("প্রিয় বন্ধুরা, আমি এখানে তোমাদেরকে একটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ আবিষ্কার সম্পর্কে বলতে এসেছি," ধূর্ত শিয়ালটি বলল, "আমি আবিষ্কার করেছি যে আমাদের লেজগুলো অপ্রয়োজনীয়।" "কী অদ্ভুত। এটা কি অপ্রয়োজনীয়?" অন্য শিয়ালগুলো বলল।)

Explanation:
"My dear friends, I am here to tell you about an important discovery," said the cunning fox. "I have discovered that our tails are unnecessary." "How strange! Is it unnecessary?" said the other foxes.

This punctuation marks direct speech with commas and quotation marks, uses a comma after the vocative "My dear friends," ends declarative sentences inside quotes with periods, and uses an exclamation mark and question mark to show surprise and a question.

"Why aren't you going to school?" said mother to her son. He said, "I am waiting for my friend to come and go to school together." ("তুমি স্কুলে যাচ্ছ না কেন?" মা তার ছেলেকে বললেন। সে বলল, "আমি আমার বন্ধুর আসার এবং একসাথে স্কুলে যাওয়ার জন্য অপেক্ষা করছি।")

Explanation:
"Mother asked her son, 'Why are you not going to school?' He said, 'I am waiting for my friend to come so that we can go to school together.'"

Capitalize the first word of each sentence and the pronoun "I", use quotation marks for direct speech with the question mark inside the mother's quote, and separate the speech from the tag with a comma and a new capitalized sentence for the reply.

Explanation:
Each independent sentence needs an end punctuation (a period or a question mark), and direct speech should be enclosed in quotation marks with the question mark placed inside the quotes for a spoken question. Commas separate introductory words (e.g., "Look,") and clauses, and contractions require apostrophes (e.g., "didn't", "it's"), so the corrected text uses periods, commas, quotation marks, a question mark, and apostrophes accordingly.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Have you killed the rats?" said the mayor. "Yes, I have," replied the piper. "Give me the promised money." "How funny you are!" said the mayor, "Take only fifty."

Explanation:
The correct answer punctuates each speaker’s words with quotation marks, starts each quoted sentence with a capital letter, and uses the proper end punctuation (a question mark inside the quotes for questions and a comma before the reporting verb when the sentence continues). So it should read: "Have you killed the rats?" said the mayor. "Yes, I have," replied the piper. "Give me the promised money." "How funny you are!" said the mayor. "Take only fifth."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Sohel asked Alam, "Friend, have you ever visited The National Memorial at Savar in Dhaka? Wow! How splendid it is!" "Yes. I haven't yet gone there," said Alam.

[Note: As there is a negative sentence after yes, yes is considered as a sentence.]

Explanation:
The correct version uses quotation marks and appropriate punctuation because Sohel's words are a question ("Have you ever visited...?"), the reaction is an exclamation ("How splendid it is!"), and Alam's reply is a negative statement with the present perfect to show experience up to now ("I haven't yet gone there."). Using these forms and punctuation makes the meaning clear and fits the rules for direct speech and tense (present perfect for past experience).

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
I said to the old man, "What are you doing?" "I am watching the boy swimming in the pond," he said. "How happy they are! May Allah bless them." "Let me sit by you and enjoy the scene." I said.

Explanation:
Explanation: In direct speech, each speaker’s words are enclosed in quotation marks and any question marks, exclamation marks or periods that end the spoken sentence go inside the quotes; reporting verbs like "said" or "replied" are separated from the quote by a comma when the quote continues and the quoted sentence begins with a capital letter. Hence the sentence is correctly punctuated as: I said to the old man, "What are you doing?" He said, "I am watching the boy swimming in the pond." He added, "How happy they are! May Allah bless them. Let me sit by you and enjoy the scene."

Solution:
My mother said to me, "Where are you going?" "I am going to school," said I. "Did you go to school yesterday?"

Explanation:
Correct indirect speech: My mother asked me where I was going; I said (that) I was going to school; she asked whether I had gone to school the day before. Explanation: In reported speech we backshift tenses (am going → was going, did go → had gone), change yes/no questions to use "whether/if", and change time words (yesterday → the day before) and pronouns as needed.

Monira said to Protiva, "How does the question seem to you? Have you got everything common?” “No, one item is uncommon to me. What about you?" said Protiva. "I'm in the same position like you," replied Monira.

Explanation:
The sentences should be corrected to: "Nothing is unfamiliar to me" (or "No item is uncommon to me") because "no one item" is ungrammatical—use "nothing" or "no + singular noun." Also say "I'm in the same position as you" (not "like you") because after "same" we use "as" to compare.

The corrected version is right because it follows direct-speech rules: each spoken sentence is enclosed in quotation marks, a question ends with a question mark, and reporting clauses use commas and proper capitalization. Remember to place commas before the closing quote when the speaker tag follows (for example, "Yes, Sir," said the girl), use a question mark for questions, and capitalize proper nouns like "Allah" and titles when appropriate.

Question:
bangladesh is a small country with a population of about sixteen crores she can hardly make headway so we should work hard to keep pace with the rest of the world

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Bangladesh is a small country. With a population of about sixteen crore, she can hardly make headway. So, we should work hard to keep pace with the rest of the world.

Explanation:
The sentence has capitalization, punctuation and clarity issues: begin with a capital "Bangladesh", avoid a run-on by separating clauses, and prefer the neutral pronoun "it" in formal writing. Also express the population clearly (e.g., "about sixteen crore" or "about 160 million"). Corrected example: "Bangladesh is a small country with a population of about sixteen crore (about 160 million); it can hardly make headway, so we should work hard to keep pace with the rest of the world."

Question:
stop you are eating all our bread shouted the two rats I am doing my best but I have told you that its difficult said the monkey give us that little piece said the rats this is my piece havent I laboured a lot for you replied the Monkey how foolish we are believing you said the two rats

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer encloses each spoken sentence in quotation marks and attributes it to the right speaker, because these are direct speeches by the two rats and the monkey. Use a comma before the reporting verb when the speech continues into the tag (e.g., "…," shouted the two rats), capitalize the first word inside the quotes, and fix contractions/punctuation (e.g., "it's", "haven't") so the meaning and grammar are clear.

Question:
whats your programme after the examination asked ratul nabil said i havent yet decided can you suggest any lets go on a picnic said ratul what an excellent idea

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"What's your programme after the examination?" asked Ratul. Nabil said, "I haven't yet decided. Can you suggest any?" "Let's go on a picnic," said Ratul. "What an excellent idea!"

Explanation:
The corrected version is right because it uses quotation marks to show spoken words, capital letters for names and sentence beginnings, and correct punctuation marks (question mark for questions, comma before a reporting clause, exclamation for strong feeling). It also uses apostrophes in contractions (e.g., "haven't") and places each speaker’s words as a separate sentence followed by the reporting phrase (e.g., "asked Ratul", "said Nabil").

Question:
the teacher said to me dont you like to practise english its an important subject and you should be more careful about it

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The teacher said to me, "Don't you like to practise English? It's an important subject, and you should be more careful about it."

Explanation:
The correct reported form is: The teacher asked me if I liked to practise English, said it was an important subject, and told me to be more careful about it. This is because questions use "if/whether" in reported speech and present simple [math]"don't like"[/math] backshifts to past [math]"liked"[/math], statements like [math]"it's"[/math] become [math]"it was"[/math], and advice is reported as "told/ advised me to..."

Question:

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
In a certain school, a student once found a one hundred taka note in the playground. He took it to his teacher. "What shall I do with it?", asked the teacher.

Explanation:
The right action is to give the note to the teacher or school office and try to find its owner, because keeping it would be taking someone else’s property and the teacher can safeguard it until the rightful owner claims it. This follows the principles of honesty and responsibility, teaching respect for others’ belongings and setting a good example.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Why are you putting up the food in your pocket? Why don't you eat?" asked the nobleman. "I am doing the right thing." replied Sheikh Sa'adi.

Explanation:
The correct answer is right because Sheikh Sadi is not selfishly hiding food but saving it—likely to give to someone in need or to prevent waste—so his reply “I am doing the right thing” shows charity and foresight. This teaches the moral idea that self-restraint and thinking of others (or avoiding waste) can be more virtuous than immediate personal gratification.

Question:

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Why don't you attend classes regularly?" the teacher said to the boy. "You can't expect good, results unless you attend classes. Be regular in class."

Explanation:
The teacher asked the boy why he did not attend classes regularly, told him that he could not expect good results unless he attended classes, and advised him to be regular in class. We backshift verbs in reported speech (don't → did not, cannot → could not), change pronouns (you → he), and turn the imperative into a reporting verb + to‑infinitive (be regular → advised him to be regular).

Question:
my sons listen to me said rahman an old farmer a great treasure lies hidden in the land there i am going to leave it for you the sons asked how shall we find it

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"My sons, listen to me," said Rahman, an old farmer. "A great treasure lies hidden in the land there. I am going to leave it for you." The sons asked, "How shall we find it?"

Explanation:
The sentence is direct speech, so each spoken line must be enclosed in quotation marks with commas or other punctuation before or after the speech tag; for example: "My sons, listen to me," said Rahman, an old farmer. "A great treasure lies hidden in the land there; I am going to leave it for you." The sons asked, "How shall we find it?" This is correct because commas separate the speech tag, the semicolon links the two related clauses, and the question mark marks the sons' question.

Question:

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Oh, my Lord! please don't kill the child," said the first woman to King Solomon. "Let her have it." King Solomon said to them, "Now everything is clear to me." Pointing the first woman, he said to the servant, "Give her the child. She is the mother of the baby."

Explanation:
The first woman’s plea to spare the child showed she valued the baby’s life above winning the dispute, a reaction a true mother would have; Solomon used that compassionate response as evidence of real motherhood and therefore gave her the child.

Question:
the teacher said to the boy where are you going now i am going to school said the boy did you go to school yesterday no the boy replied why did you not go i was suffering from fever said the boy

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The teacher said to the boy, "Where are you going now?" "I am going to school," said the boy. "Did you go to school yesterday?" "No," the boy replied. "Why did you not go?" "I was suffering from fever, said the boy.

Explanation:
Because the reporting verb is in the past ("said"), all present and past tenses backshift: "are going" becomes "was going" and "I was suffering" becomes "he had been suffering." Yes/no questions are introduced with if/whether and past simple ("Did you go yesterday?") becomes past perfect ("if/whether he had gone the day before"), and time words change ("now" → "then", "yesterday" → "the day before").

Question:
the man said to me where are you going i am going to school said i did you go to school yesterday no i replied why didn’t you go i was very busy said i

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The man said to me. "Where are you going?" "I am going to school," said I. "Did you go to school yesterday?" "No," I replied. "Why didn't you go?" "I was very busy," said I.

Explanation:
In reported speech we backshift tenses, change pronouns and keep question word order as a statement. So "Where are you going?" becomes "He asked me where I was going," "I am going to school" → "I said (that) I was going to school," "Did you go to school yesterday?" → "He asked if I had gone to school yesterday," "No" → "I replied that I had not," "Why didn’t you go?" → "He asked why I hadn’t gone," and "I was very busy" → "I said (that) I had been very busy."

Explanation:

Solution:
"Give me a few grains of corns. I am dying of hunger," said the grasshopper. "But what did you do in the summer? Didn't you store any grain?" the ant remarked, "I was too busy singing."

Explanation:
The ant’s response is right because the grasshopper spent the summer singing instead of storing food, so he failed to prepare and cannot expect help now. The story teaches the importance of foresight, hard work, and personal responsibility to avoid hardship.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Are you ill?" he said coldly. "No", I said. "Then why are you sitting when all others are working? Go out at once and give them a hand."

Explanation:
The correct punctuation is: "Are you ill?" he said coldly. "No," I said. "Then why are you sitting when all others are working? Go out at once and give them a hand." This is right because direct speech needs quotation marks, questions keep the question mark inside the quotes, a comma follows quoted short answers before the speaker tag, and the speaker tag is not capitalized when it continues the sentence.

Solution:
"Did people use stamps in those days?" asked Rafiq. "Yes," answered Mr. Jamal. The first stamps were used in 1840." "Are they easy to get now?" asked Rafiq. "They are very difficult to get," his uncle replied.

Explanation:
The corrected version is right because each spoken sentence needs proper punctuation and capitalization: questions end with a question mark and statements with a period. When a speaker tag follows, use a comma before the closing quote (e.g., "Yes," answered Mr. Jamal), and begin each quoted sentence with a capital letter.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
My dear Mother,

Your letter is just to hand. It seems to me that you are anxious for me. Why? You need not think about me.

Explanation:
The corrected sentence is: "My dear mother, your letter is just to hand. It seems to me that you are anxious for me, but you need not think about me." This is right because splitting into two sentences and adding "but" makes the contrast clear, and "need not" is a modal phrase that reassures her there is no necessity to worry.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
After supper when I began to set out, Lucy trembled in fear and said, "Alfred dear, are you quite sure that the letter really came from your chief?" I laughed, told her not to be afraid and hurried out of the room and walked down the street.

Explanation:
The correct version capitalizes the sentence start and proper names and puts Lucy’s spoken words in quotation marks with a question mark because she is asking a question. Commas are used to set off the introductory clause and the speech tag, and commas/conjunctions join the narrator’s actions to avoid a run‑on sentence.

The lion roared, "How dare you wake me up! I'll kill you." The mouse cried, "Please, let me go. I didn't mean to wake you up."

Explanation:
Explanation: The lines are direct speech, so each speaker’s words must be enclosed in quotation marks with proper punctuation inside (a question mark for "How dare you…?", an exclamation for "I'll kill you!").

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Thomas Alva Edison, a great scientist, was born in 1847 in Ohio, America. As a little boy, he was very inquisitive. He always wanted to know how things were done. Very early in life, he showed that he was full of curiosity, a quality which is so important to inventors.

Explanation:
His constant curiosity made him observe problems, ask questions, and try many experiments, which led to useful inventions—this is why calling Edison a great scientist is correct. Curiosity is the key trait for inventors because it motivates investigation, repeated testing, and learning from failures until a solution is found.
