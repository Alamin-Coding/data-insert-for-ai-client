Question:
why are you going to barishal said father i want to buy some important books said saad do you need money yes father dont go alone as time is not going well.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct version uses quotation marks with question marks for questions, a comma before the dialogue tag when the quote continues with “said…”, capitalization for sentence starts and proper nouns like [math]Barishal[/math] and forms of address (e.g., Father), and an apostrophe in contractions like “Don’t.” These rules make who speaks and the sentence type clear, for example: “Why are you going to Barishal?” said Father. “I want to buy some important books,” said Saad. “Do you need money?” “Yes, Father. Don’t go alone, as times are not going well.”

Question:
will you please tell me one reason of air pollution yes the smoke from our household activities vehicles factories etc is mainly causing air pollution

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Yes — smoke from household activities, vehicles, and factories is a major cause of air pollution because burning fuels releases harmful gases (like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide) and tiny particles (particulate matter) into the air. These pollutants build up, lower air quality, and harm human health, plants, and the environment.

Question:
my dear mother your letter is just to hand it seems to me that you are anxious for me but you need not think about me

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
You should write it as two sentences with a comma for direct address: "My dear mother, your letter is just to hand." Here "to hand" means "has just arrived." Then: "It seems to me that you are anxious for me, but you need not think about me." The comma before "but" links two independent clauses, and the sentence reassures the mother not to worry.

Question:
is there anybody here who has ever crossed a river by boat i have teacher i clearly remember what happened in that journey said jamal

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Correct reported speech: Jamal told the teacher that he had crossed a river by boat and that he clearly remembered what had happened on that journey. Reason: converting a question and present perfect into indirect speech requires changing the question into a statement, backshifting the tense ([has crossed] → [had crossed]), changing deictic words (this → that), and using "told the teacher" to show the indirect report.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct version uses quotation marks to separate each speaker’s words, capitalizes the first word of each quoted sentence, and places the appropriate comma or question mark before the reporting clause so we know who is speaking. Correct form: Mr. Rahman said, "How is your father, Bilkis?" Bilkis replied, "He is very well." "Thank you," Bilkis added. "I am glad to hear that he is in good health," said Mr. Rahman.

Question:
do not worry about a few mistakes said the teacher you can learn a lot through your mistakes do we learn from our mistakes asked the boy

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct punctuation puts each speaker’s exact words in quotation marks with the right end punctuation: "Do not worry about a few mistakes," said the teacher; "You can learn a lot through your mistakes." and "Do we learn from our mistakes?" asked the boy. This follows direct-speech rules: capitalize the first word inside quotes, keep commas/periods/question marks inside the quotation marks, and place the reporting clause (said/asked the teacher/boy) after the quoted sentence.

Question:
have you heard the name of alexander asked mr ahmed no sir razu replied how strange it is said he will you tell me about alexander please well he was the great king of macedonia

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The corrected version capitalizes proper nouns (Alexander, Mr. Ahmed, Razu, Macedonia) and the first word of each spoken sentence, and uses quotation marks to show direct speech with question marks or exclamation marks placed inside the quotes when the speaker asks or exclaims. Also, when a reporting verb follows the quoted words, use a comma before the closing quotation mark (e.g., "No, sir," Razu replied) rather than a period.

Question:
go to bed now mother said you can complete your assignment in the morning no mom ill finish it now

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct formatting puts each speaker’s words inside quotation marks and uses commas or periods as needed: “Go to bed now,” Mother said. “You can complete your assignment in the morning.” “No, Mom. I’ll finish it now.”  
This is right because quotation marks show spoken words, a comma separates the speech from the reporting clause, and capitalization and a comma after the vocative “Mom” follow standard punctuation rules.

Question:
dont you have any relative here to stay with no sir so i need a transfer certificate to be admitted there

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The answer is correct because if the student has no relative to stay with locally, the new school will require an official Transfer Certificate from the current school to complete admission. A Transfer Certificate is a formal document that proves a student has left their previous school and provides academic and conduct details needed by the admitting school.

Question:
why are you late always try to attend the class regularly yes sir the student said to the teacher

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Correct reported form: The teacher asked the student why he was always late and told him to attend class regularly; the student replied, “Yes, sir.” This is because in reported speech the present tense shifts to past (are → was), questions become “asked why …”, imperatives are reported as “told/asked + to‑infinitive,” and a short affirmative reply is reported as an agreement.

Question:
zaman can you tell me what i am teaching the teacher asked im sorry sir i can’t follow replied zaman you can’t because you are not attentive the teacher said

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The teacher’s remark is correct because Zaman said he couldn’t follow, and the teacher gave the reason—Zaman was not attentive—so the refusal and cause match. In reported speech the meaning stays the same but pronouns and tenses shift (e.g., “I can’t” → “he couldn’t”) to fit the reporting context.
