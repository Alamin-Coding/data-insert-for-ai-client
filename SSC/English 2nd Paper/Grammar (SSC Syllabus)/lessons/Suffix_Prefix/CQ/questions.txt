Question:
Everybody knows that (a)---- (smoke) is a (b)---- (danger) bad habit. It is (c)---- (harm) to health. It is also (d)---- (cost). A (e)---- (smoke) should not smoke (f)---- (public). Smoking creates (g)---- (pollute). A single puff of cigarette contains. (h)---- (numerable) harmful particles that cause many (i)---- (respirator) diseases which are incurable. But there are many people who are (j)---- (aware) of the bad effects of smoking.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) smoking; (b) dangerous; (c) harmful; (d) costly; (e) smoker; (f) publicly; (g) pollution; (h) innumerable; (i) respiratory; (j) unaware.

Explanation:
Use 'smoking' (a gerund) because we need the noun for the habit; 'dangerous' (b), 'harmful' (c) and 'costly' (d) are the adjective forms that correctly describe the habit and its effects. 'Smoker' (e) names the person who smokes, 'in public' (f) is the proper prepositional phrase, 'pollution' (g) is the noun from 'pollute', and 'numerous' (h) is the correct adjective meaning many. 'Respiratory' (i) is the adjective relating to breathing, and 'unaware' (j) correctly shows people who do not know the bad effects.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Adding suffix, prefix or both:

(a) networking; (b) popularity; (c) generation; (d) valuable; (e) browsing; (f) supervision; (g) define; (h) embarrassing; (i) invasion; (j) personal; (k) significant; (1) socialization; (m) natural; (n) cooperation.

Explanation:
Facebook is a social networking (network) site. It has gained much popularity (popular) among the young generation (generate). Sometimes, our young generation waste their valuable (value) time by browsing (browse) Facebook. So, in this respect parental supervision (supervise) is a must. Many people define (fine) Facebook as an embarrassing (embarrass) invasion (invade) of others' personal (person) privacy. However, it plays a significant (signify) role in socialization (socialize) as well as natural (nature) understanding and cooperation (operation).

Explanation:
I changed word forms by adding appropriate prefixes/suffixes so each word fits the sentence grammatically (e.g., verbs to nouns: "popularity", "invasion"; verb to gerund: "browsing"; noun to adjective: "personal", "natural"). Prefixes like "de-" and "co-" create correct meanings ("define", "cooperation"), and adjectival endings like "-ing" or "-able" make words modify nouns properly ("networking", "valuable").

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Adding suffix, prefix or both:

(a) riverine; (b) agricultural; (c) Majority; (d) Unfortunately; (e) unsatisfactory; (f) hardly; (g) disadvantages; (h) properly; (i) financial; (j) technological; (k) government; (1) conventional; (m) gradually; (n) effective.

Explanation:
Explanation: Use the correct word-forms (adjective, noun or adverb) made by adding suitable prefixes/suffixes to fit the grammar and meaning. For example, "riverine" and "agricultural" are adjectives describing the country, and "majority" is the noun meaning most people. Negative ideas use the prefix "un-" or "dis-" as in "unfortunately," "unsatisfactory," and "disadvantages"; adverbs take "-ly" (e.g., "hardly," "properly," "gradually"). Other common suffixes produce adjectives or nouns: "financial," "technological," "government" (from govern + -ment), "conventional," and "effective," which all match the roles required in the sentences.

In ancient time, textbook was the most (a)________ (resource)_________ thing for a student. (b)_________ (teach)__________were only guides and source of (c)__________ (inform)_________ The students had to collect all (d)_________(inform)___________ news from their teachers.

Teachers also maintained an ever bond of (m)___________ (friend)__________with their (n)__________ (affection)__________ students.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Adding suffix, prefix or both:

(a) resourceful; (b) Teachers; (c) information; (d) informative; (e) reference; (f) delivery; (g) dependence; (h) proficiency; (i) immeasurable; (j) popularity; (k) devotion; (1) honourable; (m) friendship; (n) affectionate.

Explanation:
Explanation: The blanks are filled by changing the root words into the grammatical form required by the sentence using common suffixes and prefixes: use [-er] to form agent nouns (teach → teachers), [-ion]/[-ation] to make abstract nouns (inform → information; devote → devotion), [-ful]/[-ive] to make adjectives (resource → resourceful; inform → informative), and [-ship], [-ity], [-ence]/[-ance] to make friendship, popularity, dependence respectively. Use the negative prefix im- with an adjective-forming suffix to negate a root when needed (measure → immeasurable). Choosing these forms makes the sentence grammatically correct because each blank requires either a noun, adjective, or agent noun that matches the surrounding words.

These follow basic word‑formation rules: prefixes (en-, un-) change meaning, and suffixes (-ly, -al, -ic, -ed, -ous, -ency/-ity/-ion) change word class so each word fits grammatically and semantically in the sentence.

ঝ "covered" — 'cover' এর past participle 'covered' ব্যবহার করে অবস্থা (remains covered with fog) বোঝানো হয়।  
ট "greatly" — 'great' থেকে adverb 'greatly' হয়ে 'suffer' ক্রিয়াকে পরিমাপ করে (ভেবে বড় কষ্ট ভোগ করা)।

(d)----- (monotony) work hinders the (e)---- (smooth) of work. Leisure (f)---- (rich) our spirit to work. Everybody knows that (g)---- (work) is (h)---- (harm). Leisure does not mean (i)---- (idle). It gives freshness to (j)----- (create) our energy.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) relaxation; (b) charmless; (c) beautiful; (d) Monotonous; (e) smoothness; (f) enriches; (g) overwork; (h) harmful; (i) idleness; (j) recreate.

Explanation:
Leisure and relaxation are both nouns, so (a) relaxation fits; life described as lacking appeal is "charmless" and the things of nature are "beautiful," so (b) charmless and (c) beautiful. Repetition needs adjectives/nouns: (d) monotonous (adj) work hinders the (e) smoothness (noun) of work. 

(f) "Leisure enriches" uses the correct verb form; (g) overwork is the single-word noun for excessive work and (h) harmful is the adjective from harm; (i) idleness (noun) means being idle; and (j) recreate (verb) means to renew or restore our energy.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
ক "writers" — কারণ এখানে 'books of famous ...' মানে বহু লেখকের বই, তাই ক্রিয়া 'write' থেকে নামবাচক বহুবচন 'writers' ব্যবহার করতে হবে।  
খ "visitors" — এখানে যারা মেলা দেখে তাদের উদ্দেশ্য, সেক্ষেত্রে 'visit' থেকে নামবাচক বহুবচন 'visitors' সঠিক।  
গ "publications" — 'publish' থেকে উৎপন্ন নামবাচক 'publication(s)' হলো বিক্রয়ের জন্য থাকা বিভিন্ন প্রকাশনা, অতএব 'publications' মানানসই।  
ঘ "buyers" — এখানে যারা কেনে তাদের বোঝাতে 'buy' থেকে নামবাচক 'buyers' (বহুবচন) ব্যবহার করা হয়।  
ঙ "crowded" — মেলার বর্ণনায় এটি একটি অবস্থা, তাই ক্রিয়ার অতীত অংশ 'crowded' অব্যয় (adjective) হিসেবে ব্যবহার করে।  
চ "various" — 'vary' থেকে গঠিত বিশেষণ 'various' ব্যবহার করলে অনেক ধরন/বিবিধ বই বোঝানো যায়।  
ছ "displayed" — এখানে বইগুলো প্রদর্শিত হওয়ার কথা বলছে, তাই passive participle 'displayed' (প্রদর্শিত) সঠিক।  
জ "chosen" — 'choose' এর অতীতভাগ 'chosen' ব্যবহার করে বোঝানো হচ্ছে দীর্ঘ অনুসন্ধানের পরে নির্বাচিত বই।  
ঝ "unavailable" — বাক্য অনুযায়ী এই সুবিধা অন্য কোথাও নেই, তাই 'available' এর নেগেটিভ রূপ 'unavailable' দরকার।  
ঞ "welcome" — 'come' থেকে গঠিত 'welcome' এখানে বিশেষণ হিসেবে ব্যবহৃত হবে: মেলা শিক্ষার্থীর কাছে সবসময় स्वागतযোগ্য/গৃহীত।

They have little (f) — (realize) of the (g) — (bounded) sufferings of the poor. They remain indifferent to their (h) — (suffer). They feel (i) — (comfort) to work for their (j) — (better).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Each blank takes the correct derived form: "luxurious" (adj from luxury), "indifferent" (negative adjective), "amusement" and "merriment" (nouns for enjoyment), "self-centered" (adj), "realization" (noun), "boundless" (opposite of bounded), "sufferings" (noun), "comfortable" (adj) and "betterment" (noun). Use adjective forms when describing people or attitudes and noun forms when naming states or things, and apply common prefixes/suffixes (in-, -ous, -ion, -ment, -less) to make the meanings fit the sentence.

Question:
In ancient time, textbook was the most (a) — (resource) thing for the students. Teachers were the only guides and source of information. The students had to collect all the (b) — (inform) from the lecture of their (c) — (teach). There was no guidebook or other (d) — (refer) books in the market. During that period a teacher had to deliver a lecture by (e) — (study) the textbook. Because of the (f) — (situate) the students used to depend on the teachers (g) — (complete). As a result, there was a great (h) — (relate) between a (i) — (teach) and a student. Their (j) — (popular) existed among the students in the society.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "resourceful" — we need an adjective from "resource" to describe the textbook as rich in resources/information.  
(b) "information" — the noun form of "inform" fits "collect all the ___."  
(c) "teacher" — the noun form of "teach" names the person giving the lecture.  
(d) "reference" — used before "books," the noun/adjective "reference" denotes books for consultation.  
(e) "studying" — the gerund form fits after "by" to show how the teacher prepared the lecture.  
(f) "situation" — the noun form of "situate" refers to the context or condition causing dependence.  
(g) "completely" — the adverb form of "complete" modifies "depend" to show extent.  
(h) "relationship" — a noun from "relate" that expresses the connection between teacher and student.  
(i) "teacher" — again the correct noun form of "teach" for the person.  
(j) "popularity" — the noun form of "popular" shows how well liked they were among students.

Question:
Success in life depends on the proper (a) — (utilize) of time. Those who waste their (b) — (value) time in (c) — (idle), reduce the time of their important work. (d) — (punctual) is another great virtue of human beings that (e) — (rich) the (f) — (man) life. If one takes lesson from the (g) — (biography) of successful persons, one will learn that they never kept any work (h) — (do) for the next day. (i) — (obvious), they were true to their words. So, they got a (j) — (respect) position in the society.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Use the correct noun/adjective forms: "utilization" is the noun after "proper", "valuable" describes time, "idleness" fits after "in", and "Punctuality" is the noun name of the virtue. Choose forms that match grammar and agreement: "enriches" agrees with the singular subject "Punctuality", "human" is the adjective for "life", "biographies" is the correct plural, and "undone" is the past-participle used as an adjective. Finally, "Obviously" is the adverb modifying the clause and "respectable" is the adjective describing "position", making the whole sentence grammatically and meaningfully correct.

a "relaxation" (noun) fits "Life without ... is dull"; b "charmless" (adjective) means lacking charm; c "beautiful" (adjective) modifies "objects"; d "monotonous" (adjective) describes work; e "smoothness" (noun) fits "hinders the ... of work"; f "renews" (verb) agrees with subject "Leisure"; g "overwork" (noun) and h "harmful" (adjective) give the correct meaning; i "idleness" (noun) contrasts with leisure; j "freshness" (noun) completes "gives ... to our mind."

Question:
People are (a) — (general) fond of glittering things. They are the (b) — (love) of the surface. They are concerned with the (c) — (out) show of things and beings. They (d) — (hard) bother about intrinsic value. Gold is a very (e) — (value) thing. But there are (f) —(vary) metals in nature that look like gold. They fade soon and become less (g) — (beauty). So the surface of anything should not be the key for its (h) — (measure). We all should be (i) — (care) about this truth. Otherwise, we will have to be (j) — (repent) in the long run.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) generally; (b) lovers; (c) outward/outer; (d) hardly; (e) valuable; (f) various; (g) beautiful; (h) measurement; (i) careful; (j) repentant.

Explanation:
Explanation: Choose the word form that fits the sentence grammatically and semantically. The correct words — generally, lovers, outward, hardly, valuable, various, beautiful, measurement, careful, repentant — match the required parts of speech (adverb, noun, adjective, etc.) and the intended meanings in each context.

Question:
Early rising is the habit of (a) — (get) up from bed early in the morning. An early (b) — (rise) can enjoy the (c) — (fresh) of the morning air. He can hear the (d) — (melody) songs of the birds. Again, he can start his day’s work (e) — (early) than others. An early riser does not suffer from (f) — (physic) problems very often. So, he need not go to any (g) — (physic) (h) — (frequent). Thus, an early riser enjoys (i) — (vary) benefits and leads a (j) — (peace) life.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) getting; (b) riser; (c) freshness; (d) melodious; (e) earlier; (f) physical; (g) physician; (h) frequently; (i) various; (j) peaceful.

Explanation:
Explanation: After "habit of" we use a gerund, so (a) is "getting"; a person who rises is a noun, so (b) "riser"; quality/state nouns use "-ness", so (c) "freshness"; songs need an adjective, so (d) "melodious". For comparison use the comparative "earlier" for (e); health uses the adjective "physical" for (f); one visits a doctor (noun) so (g) "physician" and the action needs an adverb "frequently" for (h). For (i) we use the adjective "various" to describe "benefits", and for (j) the adjective "peaceful" describes "life".

Question:
Flowers are the symbol of love and (a) — (pure). They are (b) — (know) for their beauty and fragrance. Some flowers are (c) — (note) for their fragrance and same are for their beauty. But the rose is favourite to us for its colour and beauty. Its mother place is the city of Paris. The (d) — (japan) are exceptionally famous for its (e) — (cultivate). At present most of the countries grow rose in plenty. It (f) — (general) grows from June to November. Its scent makes us (g) — (cheer). It makes people lively, lovely, (h) — (affection) and so on. By (i) — (grow) roses in plenty, we can export them and solve our (j) — (employ) problem.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) purity (b) known; (c) noted/notable; (d) Japanese; (e) cultivation; (f) generally; (g) cheerful; (h) affectionate; (i) growing: (j) unemployment.

Explanation:
(a) purity, (b) known, (c) noted, (d) Japanese, (e) cultivation, (f) generally, (g) cheerful, (h) affectionate, (i) growing, (j) employment.  
These forms are chosen because abstract qualities need nouns (purity, cultivation, employment), past participles act as adjectives (known, noted), nationality uses the adjective/noun "Japanese", manner needs an adverb (generally), emotions need adjectives (cheerful, affectionate), and after "By" we use a gerund (growing).

(d) — (monotony) work hinders the (e) — (smooth) of work. Leisure (f) — (rich) our sprit to work. Everybody knows that (g) — (work) is (h) — (harm). Leisure does not mean (i) — (idle).

Solution:
(a) relaxation; (b) charmless; (c) beautiful; (d) monotonous; (e) smoothness; (f) enriches; (g) overwork/ overworking: (h) harmful; (i) idleness; (j) creating.

Explanation:
Answers: a relaxation; b charmless; c beautiful; d monotonous; e smoothness; f enriches; g overwork; h harmful; i idleness; final verb: create.

Why these are correct: choose the part of speech that fits the sentence—nouns (e.g., [math]relaxation[/math], [math]idleness[/math], [math]overwork[/math], [math]smoothness[/math]) where a thing/state is needed, adjectives (e.g., [math]charmless[/math], [math]beautiful[/math], [math]monotonous[/math], [math]harmful[/math]) to describe, and verbs (e.g., [math]enriches[/math], [math]create[/math]) for actions. This matching of form to grammatical role makes each blank grammatically and meaningfully correct.

(d) "greedy" and (f) "dishonest" are adjectives (one from "greed", one the opposite of "honest"), and (e) "wickedness" is the noun form of "wicked."  
(g) "really" and (i) "Hopefully" are adverbs modifying the clause, (h) "At present" is a time phrase, and (j) "practice" is the correct noun.

So tree (g) — (plant) programme should be extended for a better, (h) — (happy), (i) — (healthy) life and (j) — (peace) environment.

Explanation:
Explanation:
Correct words: (a) useful, (b) impossible, (c) natural, (d) strengthens, (e) indiscriminately, (f) imbalance, (g) planting, (h) happier, (i) healthier, (j) peaceful.

Use these because adjectives like "useful", "natural" and "peaceful" modify nouns; "impossible" uses the negative prefix im- to mean not possible; "strengthens" is the correct third-person singular verb form for "It"; "indiscriminately" is an adverb (‑ly) describing how we cut; "imbalance" is the noun meaning lack of balance; "planting" is the noun/gerund used in the collocation "tree planting programme"; and "happier" and "healthier" are comparative adjectives that pair with "better" to describe life.

Explanation:
Use the correct word forms: adverbs modify verbs so (a) "seriously" (hampered), (d) "honestly" and (e) "frugally" (use electricity), and (i) the verb "upgrade" (improve power stations). Adjectives describe nouns so (c) "industrial", (g) "national", and (h) "effective" are needed, while noun forms express states or problems so (b) "difficulties" and (f) "awareness" fit best. Finally, (j) should be "disadvantages" to mean the harms we must mitigate.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক এখানে ক্রিয়াপদ "buy"‑এর উদ্দেশ্যে নাম (object) লাগবে; "happy" বিশেষণ, তাই নামবাচক রূপ "happiness" ব্যবহৃত হবে।  
খ "necessary" একটি বিশেষণ, এটিকে বর্ণনা করার জন্য ক্রিয়া বা বিশেষণের ওপর কাজ করে এমন ক্রিয়াবিশেষণ (adverb) লাগবে — তাই "obviously" সঠিক।  
গ "brings"‑কে বা পুরো ভাবকে নির্দেশ করার জন্য adverb প্রয়োজন; "necessarily" এই কাজে উপযুক্ত।  
ঘ এখানে বলা হচ্ছে সুখ মূলত মানসিক বিষয়, তাই তা বর্ণনা করতে "primarily" (অর্থাৎ প্রধানত/মূলত) ব্যবহার করা হয়।  
ঙ "the name of a ..." পর নেওয়ার জন্য名詞 প্রয়োজন; অনুভূতির অর্থে "feeling" সঠিক নামবাচক শব্দ।  
চ "content of mind" বলতে মনের সন্তুষ্টি বোঝাতে নামবাচক রূপ "contentment" প্রয়োজন।  
ছ "mental ..." বলতে মানসিক সন্তুষ্টির কথা, তাই ক্রিয়ার পরিবর্তে নাম "satisfaction" সঠিক।  
জ "a lot of ..." এর পরে বস্তুবাচক শবদ চাই; "rich" বিশেষণ, তাই বস্তুবাচক "riches" অর্থাৎ ধন-সম্পদ ব্যবহার হবে।  
ঝ "the cause of ..." পর সাধারণত নাম লাগে এবং "happy"‑এর বিপরীত বোঝাতে "unhappiness" যথাযথ।  
ঞ "suffer from" এর পরে ক্রিয়া নয় বরং নাম/ক্রিয়ানাম (gerund) লাগে; ফলে "suffering" ব্যবহার করা হয়।

He never tells a lie. He is always (f) — (response) to his duty. We should follow the path of (g) — (honest) and leave the path of (h) — (honesty). In that case, you will be (i) — (love) by all and will be able to reach the path of (j) — (prosper).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) dishonesty; (b) harmful; (c) injustice; (d) immoral; (e) uncomfortable; (f) responsible; (g) honesty; (h) dishonesty; (i) loved; (f) prosperity.

Explanation:
Use common prefixes and suffixes to form correct opposites and grammatical forms: "dis-" makes the opposite so (a) and (h) are "dishonesty"; "in-"/ "im-" make negatives so (c) = "injustice" and (d) = "immoral", while "un-" makes (e) = "uncomfortable"; "-ful" makes (b) = "harmful".  
(f) is "responsible" meaning dutiful, (g) is the noun "honesty" from "honest", (i) is the past participle "loved", and (j) is the noun "prosperity" from "prosper".  
These examples show how prefixes (dis-, in-, im-, un-) and suffixes (-ful, -ity, -ed) change word meaning and form.

Happiness cannot be bought — (a) "happiness" is the noun naming the thing. The sentence needs proper word forms: (b) "absolutely" (an adverb) to modify "is", (c) "psychological" (an adjective) to describe "thing", (d) "feeling" and (e) "contentment" are nouns for inner states, (f) "satisfied" is the adjectival past participle, (g) "really" is an adverb modifying "is", (h) "worldly" and (j) "dignified" are adjectives describing nouns, and (i) "eternally" is an adverb showing duration; in short, choose nouns for objects/states, adjectives to describe nouns, and adverbs/participles to modify verbs or show condition.

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) "writings" — From "write", the noun "writings" means written works, which fits as the subject being sold.  
(b) "visitors" — "Visitor" is the noun form of "visit"; most people who come to a fair are called visitors.  
(c) "publications" — From "publish", "publications" refers to different printed works (books, magazines), so it fits here.  
(d) "buyers" — "Buyer" is the noun form of "buy"; it correctly names the people who purchase items.  
(e) "crowded" — "Crowded" is the adjective describing a place full of people, so it suits "Our book fair is always ...".  
(f) "various" — "Various" (from "vary") is an adjective meaning different kinds of, matching "books".  
(g) "displayed" — From "display" (contains "play"), "displayed" describes how books are shown at the fair.  
(h) "chosen" — "Chosen" is the past participle of "choose" used as an adjective for the books buyers select.  
(i) "unavailable" — "Unavailable" (not available) correctly states that this facility cannot be found elsewhere.  
(j) "welcome" — From "come" the word "welcome" fits idiomatically: the fair is a welcome event (a benefit) to students.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) dangerous; (b) economic: (c) addiction; (d) addicted; (e) awareness; (f) discourage; (g) impossible; (h) united; (i) Unfortunately; (j) unwise.

Explanation:
(a) dangerous — "effects" needs an adjective, so "dangerous" describes harmful effects.  
(b) economic — "loss" takes the adjective "economic" (not "economical").  
(c) addiction — "a kind of" requires a noun, so the noun "addiction" fits.  
(d) addicted — after "become" we use the past participle "addicted" (to drugs).  
(e) awareness — we "raise awareness" (noun) among people.  
(f) discourage — to stop others we "discourage" them (verb formed with dis-).  
(g) impossible — the opposite of "possible" is needed: "It is impossible to stop..."  
(h) united — "efforts" is modified by the adjective "united."  
(i) unfortunately — a sentence adverb is required, so "unfortunately" fits.  
(j) unwise — those who do foolish things are "unwise" (adjective).

Question:
Man is (a) — (nature) curious to know the unknown. Newspaper is the best medium to satisfy this (b) — (curious). It tells us what is (c) — (happen) around the world. It is the (d) — (supply) of all sorts of news and views. A newspaper is a (e) — (power) instrument of publicity. Government (f) — (notify) are given publicly through it. It is a good (g) — (company) in our solitary hours. It helps the (h) — (grow) of public opinion. But it is not an (i) — (mix) blessing. However, newspaper has made the world (j) — (small) and help one nation to understand the other.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) naturally; (b) curiosity; (c) happening; (d) supplier; (e) powerful; (f) notifications; (g) companion; (h) growth; (i) unmixed; (j) smaller.

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) by nature — "by nature" is the correct adverbial phrase that modifies "is curious" and means "by instinct."  
(b) curiosity — a noun is needed as the object of "satisfy," so "curiosity" fits.  
(c) happening — the present participle shows ongoing events: "what is happening around the world."  
(d) source — "source" (origin) is the natural collocation: "the source of all sorts of news and views."  
(e) powerful — an adjective is needed to describe "instrument," so "powerful instrument" is correct.  
(f) notifications — the plural noun "notifications" names the official announcements given by the government.  
(g) companion — "companion" (not "company") means something that keeps you company in solitary hours.  
(h) growth — the noun "growth" correctly completes "helps the growth of public opinion."  
(i) unmixed — the idiom "not an unmixed blessing" means it is not wholly good, so "unmixed" is required.  
(j) smaller — the comparative "smaller" correctly expresses that newspapers have made the world more connected.

Explanation:
Choose the form that fits the grammar: noun where a thing is needed, adjective/adverb where something is described, and verb where an action is meant. For example, (a) "education" is a noun (the aim of something), (b) "useful" is an adjective after "be", (c) "truly" is an adverb modifying "educated", (d) "personal", (e) "thoughtful", (f) "truthful", (g) "dutiful" and (h) "prosperous" are adjectives describing nouns, (i) "remove" is the verb meaning "take away", and (j) "self-reliance" is a noun. Changing roots with the right prefixes/suffixes makes them the correct parts of speech and keeps the sentence grammatically correct.

(a) illiterate; (b) ignorant; (c) cultivation; (d) gambling; (e) famine; (f) impossible; (g) poverty/ poorness; (h) scientific; (i) available; (j) irrigation.

Explanation:

ঘ is the phrase "a gamble", ঙ should be "famine" (the correct noun) and চ is "impossible" (negative adjective formed with "im-"); ছ is the noun "poverty".  
জ requires the adjective "scientific" to modify "tools", ঝ is "available" (adjective) and ञ is the noun "irrigation".
