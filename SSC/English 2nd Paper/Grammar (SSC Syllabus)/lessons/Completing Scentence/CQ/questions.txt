Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক "because" একটি কারণ দেখায়, তাই বাক্যের প্রধান ক্রিয়ার সঙ্গে সময় মিল রেখে কারণটি অতীত কালেই দিতে হবে (উদাহরণ: "because my alarm didn't ring" বা "কারণ আমি বেশি ঘুমিয়ে ছিলাম")।

খ "As soon as" দুটি কাজের তাত্ক্ষণিক ক্রম প্রকাশ করে; তাই উভয় ক্রিয়াই সাধারণত অতীত কালেই থাকে (উদাহরণ: "As soon as I got up from bed, I brushed my teeth")।

গ "Since" কারণ নির্দেশ করে; কারণবাচক ক্লজের পরে ফলাফল দিতেই হবে এবং সময়一致 রাখতে উভয় ক্লজের কাল মিলতে হবে (উদাহরণ: "Since I could not avail the bus, I walked to school")।

ঘ "lest" নেতিবাচক উদ্দেশ্য প্রকাশ করে—কিছু ঘটাবার প্রতিরোধে—এবং পরে প্রায়শই subjunctive বা "should" আসে (উদাহরণ: "I walked fast lest I should be late")।

ঙ "If I reached late" একটি শর্তমূলক বাক্য শুরু করে; বাস্তব বা অভ্যাসজনিত গত প্রেক্ষাপটে ফলাফল দেখাতে প্রধান ক্লজে অতীতকাল বা "would/used to" ব্যবহার করা হয় (উদাহরণ: "If I reached late, the teacher would scold me" বা অভ্যাসে "If I reached late, the teacher used to scold me")।

Question:
(a) It is said that —.

(b) In youth the mind is soft that —.

(c) If we lose the morning hours of life —.

(d) We will reap good harvest —.

(e) On the other hand, if we remain lazy —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) It is said that youth is the best part of our life .

(b) In youth the mind is so soft that we can shape it according to our wish .

(c) If we lose the morning hours of life, we can't reach the goal of life .

(d) We will reap good harvest if we sow the good seeds with proper nursing .

(e) On the other hand, if we remain lazy, we must suffer in the long run .

Explanation:
(a) The correct completion is a proverb about early rising and disciplined habits: it says that regular, orderly routines (like rising early) promote health, efficiency and success. This is right because habits formed by discipline produce better physical and mental results over time.

(b) The right idea is that a young mind is pliable and easily shaped by teaching and example. That’s why education and good influence in youth have a lasting effect on character and behaviour.

(c) The sentence means that once the early, most productive years are wasted they cannot be recovered. It’s correct because time is irreversible, so losing youthful opportunities reduces future potential.

(d) This completes the cause–effect idea: if we sow good work or habits, we will reap a good harvest (good results). It’s true because effort and wise choices tend to produce corresponding positive outcomes.

(e) The contrast shows that laziness brings failure or loss of opportunities. This is right because inactivity and neglect prevent progress, so one cannot expect good results without effort.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Cricket is a game which is full of thrill and excitement .

(b) Boys and girls of our country are very fond of cricket .

(c) Though cricket is a costly game, it is played all over the world .

(d) Bangladesh is a test playing country but its standard is not so high .

(e) Our players are trying hard to upgrade the standard.

Explanation:
(a) "Cricket is a game of skill."  
It requires batting, bowling, fielding techniques and tactical judgment, so "of skill" correctly describes its nature.

(b) "Boys and girls of our country play cricket."  
Cricket is very popular among both boys and girls in schools and communities, so "play cricket" completes the idea.

(c) "Though cricket is a costly game, many people play it."  
Despite the expense of formal equipment, informal street or backyard cricket and strong popularity lead many people to play.

(d) "Bangladesh is a test playing country now."  
Bangladesh gained Test status (in 2000) and participates in Test matches, so "now" correctly indicates its current status.

(e) "Steps should be taken to upgrade the standard."  
To raise the level of cricket, planned actions like better coaching, facilities and training are needed, so "steps should be taken" fits.

ক "তারা এতই গরীব যে মৌলিক চাহিদাও পূরণ করতে পারে না।" — কারণ 'so ... that' কাঠামোর বাংলা প্রকাশে 'এত ... যে' ব্যবহার করে পরিণতি বোঝানো যায়।  
খ "সেখানে তারা অমানবিক অবস্থায় থাকায় অসুস্থতা ও অপর্যাপ্ত পরিষ্কার-পরিচ্ছন্নতার শিকার হয়।" — 'As' এখানে কারণ দেখায়, তাই 'কারণ/এতে' ধরনের অনুবাদ উপযুক্ত।  
গ "তারা ভোর থেকে সন্ধ্যা পর্যন্ত কঠোর পরিশ্রম করলেও মজুরি খুবই কম পায়।" — 'Although' বিরোধসূচক, তাই 'তবুও/তবৎ' জনিত বিরোধ নির্দেশ করে এমন রূপ ব্যবহার করা হয়।  
ঘ "আমরা তাদের সাহায্যে এগিয়ে আসবো, নতুবা তারা আরও দারিদ্র্যে পতিত হবে।" — 'lest' নেতিবাচক ফল এড়াতে বলে; বাংলা অনুবাদে 'নতুবা/নাহলে' যথোপযুক্ত।  
ঙ "শুধু তখনই তারা স্বনির্ভর হয়ে জীবনের মান উন্নত করতে পারবে।" — 'Only then' একটি শর্ত-ফল সম্পর্ক দেখায়, তাই ফল হিসেবে স্বনির্ভরতা বলা যায়।

Question:
(a) Five years have passed since —

(b) Hardly had the assembly began —

(c) — lest you should miss the plane.

(d) Danger often comes —

(e) The lady speaks as if —

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Five years have passed since I saw you last .

(b) Hardly had the assembly begun when an unknown person entered the assembly house .

(c) Drive fast/Hurry up/Walk fast/Run fast . lest you should miss the plane.

(d) Danger often comes where it is leared.

(e) The lady speaks as if she knew everything well .

Explanation:
(a) Five years have passed since I left school.  
Explanation: With a present-perfect time span like "have passed," "since" introduces a point in the past, so we use simple past ("I left") to mark the starting point.

(b) Hardly had the assembly begun when the principal arrived.  
Explanation: "Hardly" requires inversion with the past perfect ("had begun" — past participle), and "when" links the shortly following event.

(c) Leave early, lest you should miss the plane.  
Explanation: "Lest" expresses prevention and is followed formally by "should" + base verb ("should miss") to show what to avoid.

(d) Danger often comes when we least expect it.  
Explanation: "When we least expect it" is the correct adverbial time clause meaning danger arrives at unexpected moments.

(e) The lady speaks as if she were an expert.  
Explanation: "As if" with an unreal or hypothetical idea takes the subjunctive ("were") to show she is not actually an expert.

(b) The people of Bangladesh are friendly though —.

(c) When anyone falls in danger, others —.

(d) We love and help one another as if —.

(e) We work seriously in order that Bangladesh —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) This is Bangladesh which is our motherland .

(b) The people of Bangladesh are friendly though they are not rich .

(c) When anyone falls in danger, others come forward to help him/her .

(d) We love and help one another as if we were brothers .

(e) We work seriously in order that Bangladesh can prosper day by day .

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) The blank needs a relative clause of place introduced by "where" (e.g. "This is Bangladesh where I was born") because "Bangladesh" is a place.  
(b) "Though" shows contrast, so it should be followed by a contrasting fact or clause (e.g. "though many are poor" or "though not wealthy").  
(c) This is a general truth, so use the simple present with the plural subject "others" (e.g. "others help him/her").  
(d) "As if" makes a comparison and for an unreal or emphatic comparison we use the subjunctive/past form: "as if we were brothers."  
(e) "In order that" expresses purpose and is usually followed by "may/might" + verb (e.g. "in order that Bangladesh may prosper").

Question:
(a) He pretends as if —.

(b) It is high time —.

(c) Walk slowly lest —.

(d) — cannot succeed.

(e) Had I seen you before —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) He pretends as if he were mad .

(b) It is high time we did the task .

(c) Walk slowly lest you should/might fall down .

(d) Those who are idle , cannot succeed.

(e) Had I seen you before, I would have given you some money .

Explanation:
a After "as if" we use a past tense (or past perfect) to show something is unreal or contrary to fact, e.g. "He pretends as if he knew everything" — the past form "knew" shows the pretence, not reality.

b "It is high time" is followed by a past simple to express that something should happen now, e.g. "It is high time you went" — the past verb "went" functions like a subjunctive expressing present necessity.

c "Lest" introduces a negative purpose and takes a subjunctive or "should" form, e.g. "Walk slowly lest you fall" (or "lest you should fall") — it warns against an expected undesirable outcome.

d Use a negative pronoun with a positive auxiliary to avoid a double negative, e.g. "No one can succeed" (not "No one cannot succeed"); "cannot" pairs with an affirmative subject like "he" or "they."

e "Had I seen you before" uses inversion for the third conditional; it means "If I had seen you before, I would have told you," so the inverted "Had I..." replaces "If I had..." to show the unreal past condition.

(b) Many people go on smoking though —.

(c) —, we will suffer a lot.

(d) People can’t give up smoking easily because —.

(e) So attempts must be taken by us to —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Smoking is a habit which is harmful to health/causes fatal diseases .

(b) Many people go on smoking though they know its adverse effect/it is dangerous .

(c) If we do not give up smoking , we will suffer a lot.

(d) People cannot give up smoking easily because they become addicted to it .

(e) So attempts must be taken by us to avoid smoking so that we can keep fit .

Explanation:
(a) The correct completion is "is injurious to health" because the relative clause introduced by "which" should describe the habit; smoking damages lungs and causes serious diseases. 

(b) "Many people go on smoking though it is harmful/addictive" fits because despite knowing the harm, social pressures and addiction make them continue. 

(c) "If we smoke, we will suffer a lot" shows the direct consequence: continued smoking leads to health problems and suffering. 

(d) "People can’t give up smoking easily because it is addictive" is right since nicotine creates physical and psychological dependence that makes quitting hard. 

(e) "So attempts must be taken by us to discourage smoking / help people quit" is appropriate because prevention, awareness and support are needed to reduce smoking and its harm.

ক "'because' কারণ বোঝায়, তাই বাক্যের শেষ অংশে আঘাতের কারণ বলা উচিত; উদাহরণ: 'Acid rain is harmful because it damages plants, corrodes buildings and harms aquatic life.' এটি কারণ‑বর্ণনা দেয়, তাই সঠিক।  

খ "'so ... that' ফল‑প্রকাশ করে: প্রথম অংশে মাত্রা/পরিমাণ এবং পরে 'that' দিয়ে তার ফল বলা হয়; উদাহরণ: 'The wind was so strong that it blew the roof off.'  

গ "Had he been a little careful ..." হল অতীতের আনরিয়াল শর্ত (inversion of 'if he had...') যা অতীতের ভিন্ন ফলাফল ধরে; পূরণ হবে: '...he would not have made that mistake.'  

ঘ "They were frightened when ..."‑এ 'when' সময়/ঘটনা জানায় যা ভয়ের কারণ; উদাহরণ: 'They were frightened when they saw the snake.' এটি কারণ ও সময় সঠিকভাবে সংযুক্ত করে।  

ঙ "Take your umbrella lest ..."‑এ 'lest' নেগেটিভ উদ্দেশ্য বা সতর্কতা বোঝায় (মানে 'so that ... not'); সাধারণ পূরণ: 'Take your umbrella lest you get wet' বা পুরানো রীতি মতে 'lest you should get wet.'

(d) He told me that honesty is the best policy .

(e) Where there is a will , there is a way.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক He asked me where I was going. — প্রতিবেদিত প্রশ্নে প্রশ্নবোধক শব্দ (where) রাখা হয় কিন্তু বাক্যক্রম সাধারণ অর্থাৎ subject + verb হয় এবং tense অনুসারে পরিবর্তিত হয় (go → was going).

খ He showed me how it can be done. — 'how' দিয়ে শুরু হওয়া clause টি একধরণের object-clause, তাই 'how + subject + modal/verb' ক্রম বজায় থাকে এবং এটি কাজটি কীভাবে করা যায় তা বোঝায়।

গ Hardly had he started for school when it began to rain. — 'Hardly/Scarcely … when' конструкশনে inversion (Had he started) লাগে এবং এরপর সাধারণত 'when' দিয়ে দ্বিতীয় ঘটনা শুরু হয় (began to rain)।

(c) as they are too busy with studies or lack the habit. Many students prioritize academic work or have little time or interest, so they don’t read newspapers regularly.

(d) by working in the newspaper industry (as journalists, printers, vendors, etc.). The newspaper business provides various jobs—reporting, editing, printing and selling—that people depend on for income.

(c) He can't cut a good figure in the exam because he is not attentive to study.

(d) Be truthful if you want to be successful in life .

(e) His silence proves that he agrees to do this work .

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক 1971 হল সেই সাল যখন বাংলাদেশ স্বাধীনতা অর্জন করে; এটি ঐতিহাসিকভাবে সঠিক কারণ 1971 সালের স্বাধীনতা-যুদ্ধের মাধ্যমে দেশটি পাকিস্তান থেকে মুক্তি পায়।  

খ যদিও বাংলাদেশের প্রাকৃতিক সম্পদ সীমিত, তবু দেশের মানবসম্পদ (জনশক্তি), কৃষি ও উদ্যোগ তাকে উন্নয়নে সহায়তা করে; তাই সীমিত প্রাকৃতিক সম্পদের পরেও অগ্রগতি সম্ভব।  

গ সে ফেল করেছে কারণ সে পড়াশোনায় মনোযোগী নয়—এখানে 'because' একটি কারণ-ব্যাখ্যার শব্দ যা ফল (ফেল) ও কারণ (মনোযোগী না হওয়া) যোগ করে।  

ঘ সততা বজায় রাখো যদি তুমি বিশ্বাস বা সম্মান পেতে চাও; 'if' শর্ত বোঝায়—বিশ্বাস পাওয়ার শর্ত হিসেবে সত্য बोलাকে নির্দেশ করে।  

ঙ তার নীরবতা প্রমাণ করে যে সে সম্মত; সাধারণ বিবেচনায় নীরবতা অনেক সময় সম্মতি বোঝায় ("silence implies consent")।

(c) Time is so valuable that we should not waste it .

(d) Those who idle away their time , cannot shine in life.

(e) If you make the best use of time , you must be successful.

Explanation:
(a) "There goes a proverb that time and tide wait for none" — This proverb is correct because time moves on regardless of our wishes; it teaches that we must act promptly since opportunities do not pause.

(b) "Though lost wealth can be regained by hard work, lost time cannot be regained" — Time is irreversible, so once it is gone it cannot be recovered, which is why we should value and use it wisely.

(c) "Time is so valuable that we must not waste a single moment" — This emphasizes that every moment has potential value for work or learning, so wasting time reduces our chances of progress.

(d) "Those who waste time cannot shine in life" — Habitual procrastination or idleness prevents steady effort and skill-building, so such people miss the consistent work needed for success.

(e) "Use your time well, and you must be successful" — Good time management increases productivity and creates opportunities, making success far more likely.

(b) It is a matter of sorrow that------.

(c) I tried to write to you but------.

(d) In fact, we all are always------.

(e) We hope that we-----.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Five years have passed since we met last .

(b) It is a matter of sorrow that you do not utilize your time .

(c) I tried to write to you but failed due to my tight schedule .

(d) In fact, we all are always gifted with Almighty's blessings .

(e) We hope that we will succeed in the exam .

Explanation:
(a) "Five years have passed since I last saw him." — Present perfect ([math]have\ passed[/math]) is used to show time elapsed up to now, and "since" introduces the past point ("I last saw him").

(b) "It is a matter of sorrow that he died." — The structure "It is a matter of sorrow that + clause" introduces a regretful fact; the clause after "that" reports the sorrowful event in the appropriate tense.

(c) "I tried to write to you but I couldn't." — "Tried" (past) shows an attempt, and "but" contrasts it with the result; a negative like "couldn't" or "was unable to" completes the idea of failure.

(d) "In fact, we all are always learning." — "Are always" + present participle expresses a continued or habitual action; this structure emphasizes that learning is ongoing.

(e) "We hope that we will succeed." — "Hope" expresses a desire about the future, so it is natural to use "that" plus a future tense ("we will succeed") to state the expected outcome.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Many people cut trees as they do not know their importance .

(b) Trees cause rainfall which is needed for our cultivation/is essential for our agriculture .

(c) If we cut trees at random, one day our country will turn into a desert/one day there will be no trees left .

(d) Trees supply oxygen which we take in.

(e) Since trees help us in many ways, we should plant more and more trees .

Explanation:
(a) Many people cut trees for timber, fuel and to clear land. This completion shows purpose — the sentence needs a phrase explaining why people cut trees.

(b) Trees cause rainfall which helps maintain soil moisture and supports agriculture. The relative clause introduced by "which" should describe the beneficial effect of that rainfall.

(c) If we cut trees at random, soil erosion and floods will increase. This is a cause–effect conditional: removing trees causes loss of root binding, so erosion and flooding follow.

(d) Trees supply oxygen essential for human and animal life. This states a factual result of photosynthesis, so the completion should name the life-supporting role of oxygen.

(e) Since trees help us in many ways, we must protect and plant more of them. The sentence gives a reason, so the natural completion is a conclusion or recommendation based on that reason.

Explanation:
ক ফুল ভালোবাসা, সৌন্দর্য ও পবিত্রতার প্রতীক হওয়ায় মানুষের চোখে তা বিশেষ সুন্দর ও প্রশংসনীয়—তাই এটি সকলের কাছে আকর্ষণীয় বা প্রশংসিত।

খ প্রায় সবাই ফুল পছন্দ করে; তাই বলা হয় যে কমই এমন মানুষ আছে যিনি ফুল পছন্দ করেন না—এটি সাধারণ মানুষের স্বভাবগত রুচি নির্দেশ করে।

গ শত্রুকে বন্ধু করা যায় যদি আমরা সদয়তা, ক্ষমা বা মমত্ব প্রদর্শন করি; ভালো আচরণ অন্যের মন বদলে দিতে সাহায্য করে।

ঘ যারা ফুল পছন্দ করে না তাদের সম্পর্কে বলা হয় যে তাদের হৃদয়ে কোমলতা বা সৌন্দর্যের অনুভূতি কম—এটি ফুলপ্রতি অনুরাগকে মানবিক কোমলতার প্রতীক হিসেবে দেখায়।

ঙ অনেকেই ফুল চাষ করে কারণ ফুল পরিবেশ সুন্দর করে, খুশি দেয় এবং ব্যবসায়িক বা আয়-উৎস হিসেবে কার্যকর—এই কারণে ফুলের চাহিদা ও গুরুত্ব বেশি।

Question:
(a) If you do not waste time —.

(b) This is the boy —.

(c) — I were a child.

(d) United we stand, —.

(e) The boy is so weak in mathematics —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) If you do not waste your time, you will shine in life .

(b) This is the boy who secured the first place in the exam .

(c) I wish I were a child.

(d) United we stand, divided we fall .

(e) The boy is so weak in mathematics that he can never pass in it in the exams .

Explanation:
(a) "If you do not waste time, you will succeed." — This is a first conditional: the if-clause uses the present simple and the main clause uses "will" to show a likely future result.

(b) "This is the boy who helped me." — Use "who" for people when the relative clause is the subject (he helped), so "who" correctly introduces the clause.

(c) "If only I were a child." — "If only" expresses a wish about an unreal present situation; the subjunctive "were" is used after wishes (not "was").

(d) "United we stand, divided we fall." — This is a fixed proverb showing contrast; "divided we fall" completes the balanced antithesis to "united we stand."

(e) "The boy is so weak in mathematics that he cannot solve the problem." — The "so... that" pattern links degree to result: his weakness is the cause and the inability to solve the problem is the result.

(b) A man who —- cannot shine in life.

(c) It is hard labour that —-

(d) The idle cannot reach their target because —-

(e) —- unless you work hard.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) We must work hard in order that we can succeed in life .

(b) A man who wastes time in idleness , cannot shine in life.

(c) It is hard labour that helps a man to reach his goal .

(d) The idle cannot reach their target because they waste their valuable time .

(e) You will suffer in the long run unless you work hard.

Explanation:
(a) We must work hard in order that we may succeed.
Explanation: "In order that" expresses purpose and is followed by a clause showing the intended result; "may succeed" correctly shows the goal of working hard.

(b) A man who does not work hard cannot shine in life.
Explanation: The relative clause "who does not work hard" defines the kind of man, and the negative shows the consequence that he cannot succeed or "shine."

(c) It is hard labour that brings success.
Explanation: This cleft sentence ("It is ... that") emphasizes the cause; it shows that hard labour is the key factor producing success.

(d) The idle cannot reach their target because they do not work hard.
Explanation: "Because" gives the reason — idleness (not working hard) is the cause of failing to reach targets.

(e) Nothing can be achieved unless you work hard.
Explanation: "Unless" means "if not," so this conditional states that without hard work, achievement is impossible.

(c) As I could not hire a rickshaw, —–.

(d) On the way to school I walked fast lest —-.

(e) If I reached late, —-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Yesterday I did not get up early from bed because I was ill/I went to bed late .

(b) As soon as I got up from bed, mother told me to take breakfast/I noticed that it was 9 o'clock/I saw that I was late to go to school .

(c) As I could not hire a rickshaw, I began to walk fast/I became awful .

(d) On the way to school I walked fast lest I should miss the class/I should miss an important class .

(e) If I reached late, I would be punished/I should miss an important class/I would miss the first period .

Explanation:
ক কারণ (because) ভাগের সাথে কারণ দেই, তাই একই কাল (অতীত) ব্যবহার করতে হবে — উদাহরণ: “because I was feeling unwell” বা “because I was very tired” যেন বাক্যটির বদ্দলটি ঘটনার সময়ের সাথে মিল থাকে। 

খ “As soon as” সময় নির্দেশ করে এবং সঙ্গে সঙ্গে ঘটা ক্রিয়ার কথা বলে, তাই সাধারণত সরাসরি অতীত কালের ক্রিয়া লাগে — উদাহরণ: “I brushed my teeth” বা “I had my breakfast.” 

গ এখানে “As I could not hire a rickshaw” কারণ দেখায়, ফলে ফলাফল শুদ্ধভাবে অতীতে বলা হবে, যেমন “I had to walk to school” বা “I walked to school.” 

ঘ “lest” মানে ‘ভয়ে যাতে না’ — এটি সাধারণত ‘should’ + মূল ক্রিয়া বা ‘may/might’ দিয়ে পাছার উদ্দেশ্য/ভয় বোঝায়; সঠিক: “lest I should be late” (অথবা “lest I be late”)। 

ঙ “If I reached late” হলে ফলাফল দুইভাবে লেখা যায়: যদি সাধারণ অতীত অভিজ্ঞতা বোঝাতে চান তবে ফলাফলও অতীতে রাখবেন (“my teacher scolded me”); যদি সম্ভাব্য পরিণতি বোঝাতে চান তবে শর্তাধীন ফলাফল gebruikt=”would” (“I would be punished”).

(c) Unless you are united, you will be destroyed by your enemics/you cannot be successful/cannot succeed/you will fail/you can't prosper in life .

(d) Do you/Who does not know this wise saying?

(c) The story of the old man and his sons teaches us that unity is strength/unity/to be united .

Explanation:
(a) United we stand, divided we fall.  
Explanation: This is a fixed proverb contrasting unity and disunity; it means people succeed when they are united and fail when they are divided.

(b) It is high time we left.  
Explanation: After "It is high time" English uses a past-tense verb (here "left") to express that something should happen immediately or is overdue.

(c) Unless you are united, you will fail.  
Explanation: "Unless" introduces the negative condition (if you are not united); the result clause states the consequence of that condition.

(d) Who does not know this wise saying?  
Explanation: This rhetorical question uses the negative form to imply that the saying is very well known; "Who doesn't know...?" is a common idiom.

(e) The story of the old man and his sons teaches us that unity is strength.  
Explanation: The tale shows that individual sticks are weak but together they are strong, so its moral is that unity brings strength.

Question:
(a) No sooner had I reached home than-------.

(b) He was so lazy that-------.

(c) It is health which-------.

(d) He succeeded though-------.

(e) As our elders love us,---------.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) No sooner had I reached home than it started raining .

(b) He was so lazy that he could not finish the job in time .

(c) It is health which is wealth .

(d) He succeeded though he did not work hard .

(e) As our elders love us, we should obey them .

Explanation:
(a) No sooner had I reached home than it began to rain.
Explanation: "No sooner ... than" shows that one event happened immediately after another and requires inversion (auxiliary before subject) in the first clause.

(b) He was so lazy that he did not finish his work.
Explanation: "So ... that" expresses a cause–result relationship: the adjective "lazy" is the cause and the clause after "that" gives the consequence.

(c) It is health which makes life worth living.
Explanation: This is a cleft/relative structure emphasizing "health"; "which" introduces the clause that describes the role or importance of health.

(d) He succeeded though he had little experience.
Explanation: "Though" introduces a concession meaning "in spite of"; it contrasts the unexpected success with the limiting condition.

(e) As our elders love us, we should respect them.
Explanation: "As" gives a reason (because), so the main clause expresses the appropriate response or consequence to that reason.

(b) The answer that he ------.

(c) Finishing the work,------.

(d) I saw my mother------.

(e) To walk in the morning------.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) would be present there if he told me.

(b) The answer that he gave me was not satisfactory .

(c) Finishing the work, I went to market .

(d) I saw my mother cooking food in the kitchen .

(e) To walk in the morning is good for health .

Explanation:
(a) "I would help him if he told me." — This is a second conditional: the if-clause uses past simple "told" to show a hypothetical situation, so the main clause uses "would" + base verb ("would help").

(b) "The answer that he gave." — The relative clause uses past simple "gave" because it refers to a completed action in the past.

(c) "Finishing the work, he went home." — A participle clause ("Finishing the work") shows an action done just before the main action; the subject of the participle is the same as the subject of the main clause ("he").

(d) "I saw my mother crossing the road." — After perception verbs you can use "object + -ing" to show an ongoing action; you can also say "I saw my mother cross the road" (bare infinitive) to mean you witnessed the whole action.

(e) "To walk in the morning is healthy." — An infinitive phrase acts as the subject here, so it takes a singular verb ("is") and expresses a general truth or habit.

(e) I saw a bird flying in the sky. (আমি একটি পাখিকে আকাশে উড়তে দেখলাম।)

Explanation:
(a) If the sky is cloudy, it will probably rain.
Explanation: This is a real conditional about weather, so we use present tense in the if-clause and "will" + base verb in the main clause to show a likely future result.

(b) There are some habits which should be given up.
Explanation: "There are some…" introduces existence, and the relative clause "which should be given up" specifies those habits that ought to be abandoned.

(c) Man is curious by nature.
Explanation: "By nature" is a fixed phrase expressing a general truth about people, so this sentence states a habitual/characteristic quality.

(d) If I had seen him, I would have spoken to him.
Explanation: This is a third conditional (unreal past): "If" + past perfect in the if-clause and "would have" + past participle in the result clause to show an action that did not happen.

(e) I saw a bird flying.
Explanation: Simple past "saw" reports a past observation, and the present participle "flying" describes what the bird was doing at that time.

(e) Telling a lie is a great sin. (মিথ্যা বলা মহাপাপ।)

Explanation:
(a) If you eat a balanced diet, you will stay healthy.  
This is a first conditional: the if-clause uses present simple ("eat") for a real possibility, and the main clause uses "will" for the result.

(b) If I were invited, I would join the party.  
This is a second conditional for an unreal or unlikely situation: use the past subjunctive ("were") in the if-clause and "would" in the main clause.

(c) Walking is a good exercise.  
"Walking" is a gerund (verb+ing) functioning as a noun and the subject of the sentence.

(d) His syllabus is well designed.  
"Designed" is a past participle used adjectivally (with "well") to describe the syllabus.

(e) Lying is a great sin.  
"Lying" is a gerund naming the action and acting as the subject, which is common when talking about general moral statements.

Explanation:
(a) I feel like going for a walk.
Explanation: "Feel like" is followed by a gerund to express a desire or inclination, so "going" (gerund) is correct.

(b) Babies do not know right from wrong.
Explanation: This noun phrase shows that infants haven’t developed moral judgment yet; "do not know" correctly takes the noun phrase "right from wrong."

(c) I saw a beggar sitting by the road.
Explanation: With verbs of perception like "saw," use object + present participle to describe the action you observed ("saw someone sitting").

(d) Were I a rich man, I would travel the world.
Explanation: This is an inverted subjunctive conditional (equivalent to "If I were...") used for hypothetical situations; the main clause uses "would."

(e) If you do not work hard, you will fail the exam.
Explanation: This is a first conditional: present simple in the "if" clause with "will" in the main clause to express a likely future consequence.

Question:
(a) No sooner had we reached the school —.

(b) Unless you study attentively —.

(c) Scarcely had the party begun —.

(d) If I had known his mobile number, —.

(e) Work hard provided that —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) No sooner had we reached the school —.
The correct continuation uses "than" with inversion, e.g. "No sooner had we reached the school than the bell rang." This structure (No sooner + auxiliary + subject + past participle ... than ...) shows one action immediately followed another.

(b) Unless you study attentively —.
"Unless" means "if not," so the main clause normally uses the future: "Unless you study attentively, you will fail the exam." It expresses a negative condition: success depends on studying.

(c) Scarcely had the party begun —.
This pairs with "when" (or "before") and uses inversion, e.g. "Scarcely had the party begun when it started to rain." "Scarcely/hardly ... when" indicates one event happened immediately after another.

(d) If I had known his mobile number, —.
This is a third‑conditional (past unreal): "If I had known his mobile number, I would have called him." Form: If + past perfect, ... would have + past participle (an unreal past result).

(e) Work hard provided that —.
"Provided that" means "on condition that," so complete with a condition: "Work hard provided that you want to succeed." It sets a requirement — you should work hard only if that condition holds (or it explains the reason/condition for the advice).

Question:
(a) I am looking for Raihan. If I had seen him, —.

(b) Shila seemed upset. She talked as if —.

(c) Yesterday we were at our office. Scarcely had we finished our duty —.

(d) We are not free from danger. Danger often comes where —.

(e) Restless life is risky. We have to take rest —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) If I had seen him, I would have told you.
Explanation: This is a past unreal (third) conditional: "If" + past perfect ("had seen") with "would have" + past participle to show a hypothetical past action that did not happen.

(b) She talked as if she were upset.
Explanation: After "as if" to describe an unreal or hypothetical state we use the subjunctive "were" (even with past narration), so "as if she were upset" fits the meaning that she appeared upset.

(c) Scarcely had we finished our duty when the bell rang.
Explanation: "Scarcely... when" shows one action immediately followed another; inversion ("Scarcely had we...") is required after "scarcely" in this structure.

(d) Danger often comes where we least expect it.
Explanation: This is a common idiom meaning danger appears unexpectedly; "where we least expect it" completes the thought naturally and idiomatically.

(e) We have to take rest from time to time.
Explanation: "From time to time" (or "occasionally") expresses the idea of taking periodic rest, which matches the warning that a restless life is risky.

(c) As the people of Bangladesh are hard-working, —.

(d) But now she has made a remarkable development in her GDP —.

(e) So, it is our bounden duty to —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "Where there is a will, there is a way." — This proverb means that firm determination leads people to find solutions; if someone truly wants to achieve something, they will overcome obstacles.

(b) "If a man does not work hard, he will not succeed." — Success generally follows effort; without persistent hard work one cannot expect to achieve goals or rewards.

(c) "As the people of Bangladesh are hard-working, the country is developing steadily." — A diligent workforce raises productivity and investment, so collective hard work contributes directly to national development.

(d) "But now she has made a remarkable development in her GDP, indicating significant economic growth." — An increasing GDP reflects higher production, incomes and investment, so a notable GDP rise shows the economy is expanding.

(e) "So, it is our bounden duty to work for the country's progress and safeguard its achievements." — Citizens’ responsibility is to contribute through hard work, honesty and protection of resources so that development is sustained.

ক লেজার বা অবসর বলতে সেই সময়কে বোঝায় যখন কোন কাজের বাধ্যবাধকতা নেই এবং ব্যক্তি বিশ্রাম ও বিনোদনের জন্য ফ্রি থাকে।  
খ আমরা ভৌতবাদের যুগে বসবাস করি বলে মানুষ প্রায়ই পদার্থিক সমৃদ্ধি অর্জনের দিকে মনোযোগ দেয় এবং জীবনের অন্যান্য দিক ভুলে যেতে পারে।  
গ কিন্তু মনে রাখতে হবে যে অবসরকে সৎ ও উপযোগী কাজে ব্যয় করতে হবে; অবসর কেবল অলসতার জন্য হওয়া উচিত নয়।  
ঘ কারণ কেউ কাজের পর বিশ্রাম না নিলে তার ক্লান্তি বাড়ে এবং কাজের দক্ষতা ও স্বাস্থ্যের ক্ষতি হয়।  
ঙ তাই আমাদের বিশ্রাম নেওয়া উচিত যাতে শরীর-মন সুস্থ থাকে এবং পরবর্তীতে কার্যকারীভাবে কাজ করা যায়।

(b) It is so delicious that —.

(c) Rajshahi is the place where —.

(d) If you visit Rajshahi, Bogura and Dinajpur —.

(e) People of this area produce a huge amount of mangoes and —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:

(a) The mango is a fruit which is rich in vitamins. — "which" introduces a relative clause giving more information about "fruit."

(b) It is so delicious that everyone likes it. — "so ... that" expresses a result; "that" introduces the result clause (everyone likes it).

(c) Rajshahi is the place where many mangoes are grown. — "where" links the noun "place" to a clause describing what happens in that place (in which many mangoes are grown).

(d) If you visit Rajshahi, Bogura and Dinajpur, you will see large mango orchards. — A real conditional: present tense in the "if" clause plus "will" in the main clause shows a likely future result.

(e) People of this area produce a huge amount of mangoes and export them. — "and" connects two related actions (producing and exporting) to complete the idea.

Question:
(a) It is English which —.

(b) But most of the students don’t know how —.

(c) If a student wants to do well in English —.

(d) Unless he/she practices it, —.

(e) It is high time —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) It is English which can help us for global communication .

(b) But most of the students don't know how to learn English .

(c) If a student wants to do well in English s/he has to practise it .

(d) Unless s/he practises it, it will be difficult for her/him to learn it .

(e) It is high time we had a sound knowledge of English .

Explanation:
(a) This is a cleft construction where "which" introduces a relative clause referring back to "English"; complete it with a clause like "which I enjoy most" so the relative pronoun has a verb and object.  
(b) After "how" use an indirect-question or an infinitival phrase: e.g., "how to study" or "how they can improve"; for instructions prefer "how to + base verb."  
(c) This begins a first‑conditional idea: use "If + present simple, ... will/should/can + base verb" (e.g., "If a student wants to do well in English, he/she should practise regularly").  
(d) "Unless" means "if not," so follow it with present simple and a result clause (often future): e.g., "Unless he/she practices it, he/she won't improve."  
(e) After "It is high time" use a past tense/subjunctive to show something should already happen: e.g., "It is high time you started working harder."
