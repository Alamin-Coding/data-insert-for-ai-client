Explanation:
Filled answers: (a) depends, (b) lead, (c) build, (d) work, (e) noted, (f) waste, (g) will fall, (h) remains, (i) reaches, (j) follow.

Solution:
Right form of verbs:

(a) observe; (b) make; (c) waste; (d) fall; (e) are; (f) know; (g) do; (h) utilize; (i) is; (j) follow.

Explanation:
Explanation: Use the base form after a modal like "should", so (a) "imitate", (h) "use" and (l) "follow". Use the simple present for habitual/general truths: (b) "make" (good use), (c) "waste" and (d) "fall". For states use the verb "be" → (e) "are"; after "can" use the base verb → (g) "do"; and since "punctuality" is singular, (i) is "is".

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Right form of verbs:

(a) originate; (b) are; (c) killing; (d) do not have; (e) seen; (f) making; (g) throw; (h) living; (i) worked; (j) ensured.

Explanation:
Explanation: (a) uses the simple present "flow" because rivers generally do this as a fact; (b) needs the verb "are" to show state; (c) is present continuous "are polluting" to show an ongoing harmful action. (d) "have no" expresses lack of facilities; (e) and (f) are parallel actions so present participles "releasing" and "making" (or "polluting") show ongoing processes; (g) uses simple present "throw" for a habitual action. (h) requires the adjective "alive" to describe the state of fishes; (i) uses the past form "came" after "it is high time" to express urgency (subjunctive sense); (j) needs a past participle like "created" (or "ensured") in passive to show the environment cannot be brought into existence.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Right form of verbs:

(a) is caused; (b) named; (c) causes; (d) die; (e) go; (f) are needed; (g) get; (h) should make; (i) be destroyed; (j) keeping.

Explanation:
We use the passive "is caused" in (a) because dengue results from mosquito bites, and "called" in (b) names the mosquito; (c) takes "is a" to state a general fact. The simple present "die" (d) and "fall" (e) form a zero‑conditional showing a general cause–effect. "Are needed" (f) agrees with the plural idea "much care and proper treatment," while "in order to" requires the infinitive "keep" (g) and habitual action uses simple present "keep" (h). "Should be destroyed" (i) uses passive to show a recommended action, and "with a view to" requires the gerund "keeping" (j).

As he is free now, he thinks that he___________ (h)_________the island now. (i)_________ this he becomes so excited that he (j)_____________ his friends to a meeting.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Right form of verbs:

(a) appears; (b) lives; (c) has been living; (d) did not visit; (e) hears/has heard; (f) Hearing; (g) to pay; (h) should visit; (i) Thinking; (j) calls;

Explanation:
(a) uses the present continuous "is appearing" because the exam is happening this year (an ongoing action); (b) uses simple present "lives" for a permanent fact; (c) uses present perfect "has lived" with "since his birth" to show an action continuing up to now.  
(d) is negative present perfect "has not visited" with "yet" to say the experience hasn’t happened; (e) is present perfect "has heard" for experience/information received.  
(f) is a linking phrase like "Because of this" and (g) takes the infinitive "to pay" after "eager" ("eager to pay a visit").  
(h) uses a modal like "should visit" (expressing his decision/plan) and (i)/(j) ("On this" / "calls") show the immediate result — he becomes excited and calls his friends.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Right form of verbs:

(a) possess; (b) claim; (c) brings; (d) is; (e) lost; (f) spent; (g) paid; (h) neglected; (i) lost; (j) neglected.

Explanation:
Most answers are chosen for meaning, collocation and tense/agreement: "hold" collocates with "mentality"; "believe/think" is the reporting verb for an opinion; "brings" agrees with the singular subject "possession"; "is" is the correct copula; "have sacrificed" shows past action affecting the present so "sacrificed" fits; "spend" follows as a habitual/resulting action; "paid" matches the idiom "paid high prices"; "lost" fits the consequence for friends/family; "missed" collocates with "opportunities"; and "lost" (peace) correctly expresses the lack of inner calm. Focus on collocations (common verb + noun pairs), subject‑verb agreement, and tense consistency to choose the right verb forms.

A proverb goes that a man without an aim is a ship without a rudder. Likewise, a man without an aim (a)_________ reach his goal. He (b)________ in his way of life. So everyman should (c)_________ a definite aim. But nothing is more difficult than the choice of profession. Students (d)_________ it very difficult to choose a suitable__________ profession. Choosing profession becomes very difficult because there (e)__________ many paths and courses open to them. They should (f)__________ their aim according to the abilities they are (g)_________ with. All (h)_________ the same abilities and aptitude. Students may (i)________ their teachers who are able to (j)__________ their abilities.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Right form of verbs:

(a) cannot; (b) stumbles; (c) have; (d) find; (e) are; (f) fix; (g) endowed; (h) do not possess; (i) consult; (j) evaluate.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) cannot, (b) drifts, (c) have, (d) find, (e) are, (f) choose, (g) endowed, (h) do not have, (i) consult, (j) judge. 

Use "cannot" to show inability; third-person singular verbs take -s ("drifts"); "should" is followed by the base form ("have"); "find it difficult" is the correct collocation; "there are" expresses plural existence. "Choose" matches the meaning of selecting an aim, "endowed with" correctly describes possessed abilities, "do not have" negates possession for all, and students "consult" teachers who can "judge" their abilities.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Right form of verbs:

(a) refers; (b) reflects; (c) has; (d) obeying; (e) was; (f) respect; (g) hampered; (h) ensuring; (i) required; (j) expect.

Explanation:
Social value (a) "relates to" is correct because we use "relate/pertain to" to show connection with customs, beliefs, practices and norms. "Reflects" for (b) is right since social values show or mirror a nation's culture, and "has" for (c) shows possession of educative value. In the rest: "maintaining" (d) follows "conscious of" (a gerund is needed), "was" (e) agrees with the singular "each and every person", "pay (due) respect" (f) is the fixed expression, "hampered" (g) is the past-participle/adjective meaning affected, "maintain" (h) expresses purpose, "needed" (i) shows necessity, and "lead" (j) is the verb used with "life" (we "lead a life").
