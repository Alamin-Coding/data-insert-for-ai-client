Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) the; (b) in; (c) x; (d) with; (e) The; (f) a; (g) an; (h) x; (i) A; (j) an.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) the; (b) on the; (c) x; (d) with; (e) the; (f) a; (g) an; (h) x; (i) a; (j) an.

Explanation: Use a "the" in (a) because "one of the most" requires the definite article with a superlative, and in (e) because specific hills of the town are meant. Use "on the" in (b) for location with "western bank," and "with" in (d) to show accompaniment. Use "a"/"an" for single countable nouns ((f), (i), (g), (j)) choosing "an" before a vowel sound; omit the article (x) after a possessive ("its" in (c)) and after a quantifier ("several" in (h)).

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Gap filling with articles or prepositions:

(a) the; (b) x; (c) x; (d) for; (e) the; (f) the; (g) of; (h) in; (i) to; (j) at.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) the, (b) one's, (c) — (no word), (d) for, (e) the, (f) the, (g) of, (h) in, (i) to, (j) at.

Explanation: Use "the" for specific nouns ("the best time", "the maxim", "the seeds") and "one's" to show possession of "life"; no article is needed before "most important" because it's a predicate adjective. "For" introduces the logical subject ("for one to remember"), "of" shows what the seeds consist of, "in this season" gives the time/place of sowing, "to reap" indicates purpose, and "at this time" denotes when something takes root.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) to, (b) at, (c) for, (d) an, (e) the, (f) the, (g) on, (h) his, (i) a, (j) an.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Gap filling with articles or prepositions:

'(a) an; (b) from; (c) in; (d) for; (e) x; (f) among; (g) for; (h) to; (i) x; (j) of.

Explanation:
(a) "an" — because we need the singular form "an infectious disease" and "infectious" begins with a vowel sound.  
(b) "around" — "around the world" is the common preposition meaning everywhere in the world.  
(c) "in" — "in many countries" shows where the economic crisis exists.  
(d) "for" — "a great disaster for the people" indicates who is affected.  
(e) "x" (no article) — no article is used before the adjective "deadly" in the predicate "is very deadly."  
(f) "among" — "awareness among mass people" (better: "among the masses") shows awareness within a group.  
(g) "from" — "learnt many things from it" shows the source of learning.  
(h) "to" — "indifferent to some rules" is the correct idiom.  
(i) "x" (no article) — no article is needed when talking generally about "massive gatherings" in plural.  
(j) "of" — the phrase is "a habit of washing hands," so "of" links habit and action.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Gap filling with articles or prepositions:

(a) of; (b) a; (c) with; (d) the; (e) a; (f) a; (g) with; (h) in; (i) on; (j) an.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) of, (b) a, (c) — (no word), (d) be a, (e) a, (f) a, (g) in, (h) in, (i) on, (j) an.

Use 'of' after "types"; use 'a' or 'an' with singular countable nouns (e.g., "a dream," "a future plan," "a must," "an aim"); (c) needs no article or preposition because "meet it" is complete. Use 'in' for being within a field or showing interest ("in the working field," "interest in action"), and 'on' for dependence ("depends on a real dream"); 'to be a' is the correct infinitive phrase in (d).

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Gap filling with articles or prepositions:

(a) the; (b) x; (c) x; (d) for; (e) the; (f) the; (g) of; (h) in; (i) to; (j).at.

Explanation:
Explanation: a "the" is required because "best" is a superlative and takes the definite article; b is a cross (x) because "life" is used in a general sense and needs no article.  
c is x (no word) because "most important" works as the predicate adjective; d "for" introduces who should act ("one"); e "the" specifies that particular maxim.  
f "the" and g "of" form the phrase "the seeds of …"; h "in" indicates the season (time) when they are sown and i "to" shows purpose ("to reap"); j "during" correctly denotes the period when something takes root.
