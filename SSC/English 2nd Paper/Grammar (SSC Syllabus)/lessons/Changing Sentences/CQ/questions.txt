Question:
(a) Patriotism is a noble virtue. (Interrogative)

(b) It is the greatest of all virtues in a man’s life. (Comparative)

(c) It persuades a man to do everything just. (Negative)

(d) This quality highly motivates á man so that he can sacrifice his life for the country. (Simple)

(e) What an outstanding quality it is! (Assertive)

(f) A man having patriotic zeal is called a patriot. (Complex)

(g) A patriot fears none but the Creator. (Affirmative)

(h) By paying taxes he obeys the law. (Compound)

(i) He is respected by all. (Active)

(j) So we should be patriots. (Imperative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) The sentence is a declarative (assertive) simple sentence because it states a fact: subject + verb + complement, with no question or command.  
(b) This is a superlative (not comparative) declarative sentence because the word "greatest" shows the highest degree among all.  
(c) The sentence is affirmative (positive) and declarative because it affirms an action; there is no negation word like "not" or "never."  
(d) This is a complex sentence: the main clause ("This quality highly motivates a man") is followed by a subordinate purpose clause ("so that he can sacrifice his life for the country").  
(e) It is exclamatory because it expresses strong feeling using "What ...!" rather than making a plain statement.  
(f) Grammatically this is a simple sentence with a participial phrase ("having patriotic zeal") modifying "a man"; it does not contain a separate clause, so it is not complex.  
(g) The sentence is negative in meaning because "none" (no one) negates the verb—so it expresses negation rather than being purely affirmative.  
(h) This is a simple sentence: a single independent clause with an introductory adverbial phrase ("By paying taxes"); it is not two independent clauses joined, so it is not compound.  
(i) The sentence is passive voice because the subject ("He") receives the action ("is respected") rather than doing it; the active form would be "All respect him."  
(j) This is a declarative suggestion (modal statement) using "should," not an imperative command; an imperative would be "Be patriots."

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Changing Sentences:

(a) What a virtue simplicity is! (সরলতা কী যে এক গুণ!)

(b) There is nobody but appreciates this quality. (এমন কেউ নেই যে এই গুণের প্রশংসা করে না।)

Or, There is nobody who does not appreciate this quality. (অথবা, এমন কেউ নেই যে এই গুণের প্রশংসা করে না।)

(c) Very few qualities are as good as it. (খুব কম গুণই এর মতো ভালো।)

(d) This virtue should be practised. (এই গুণের অনুশীলন করা উচিত।)

(e) A simple man is happier than most other men. (একজন সরল মানুষ অন্য অধিকাংশ মানুষের চেয়ে বেশি সুখী।)

(f) Without practising simplicity, none can earn people's favour. (সরলতার চর্চা না করে কেউই মানুষের অনুগ্রহ অর্জন করতে পারে না।)

(g) What a carefree life a simple man leads! (একজন সরল মানুষ কতই না দুশ্চিন্তামুক্ত জীবনযাপন করে।)

(h) A simple man is the happiest person among us. (একজন সরল মানুষ আমাদের মধ্যে সবচেয়ে সুখী ব্যক্তি।)

(i) Let everybody like simplicity. (সবাই সরলতা পছন্দ করুক।)

(j) So, all should lead a simple life. (তাই, সকলের উচিত সরল জীবনযাপন করা।)

Explanation:
(a) What a great virtue simplicity is!
Explanation: Exclamatory sentences use "What" (noun phrase + subject + verb) to express strong feeling; here the structure emphasizes the praise of simplicity.

(b) Nobody fails to appreciate this quality.
Explanation: To convert to a negative without changing the meaning, use "nobody fails to…" which keeps the original affirmative sense that all appreciate it.

(c) It is a very good quality.
Explanation: Changing from superlative ("one of the best") to the positive degree removes comparison; "very good" gives the plain positive form.

(d) This virtue should be practised.
Explanation: Passive voice with a modal uses "should be" + past participle, so the object ("this virtue") becomes the subject of the passive sentence.

(e) A simple man is happier than most men.
Explanation: Comparative degree uses "happier than" to compare two groups; this conveys the same idea as "very few men are as happy as…".

(f) By practising simplicity one cannot fail to earn people's favour.
Explanation: Using "cannot fail to" is a negative form that preserves the original meaning (that practising simplicity will certainly earn favour).

(g) What a very carefree life a simple man leads!
Explanation: Exclamatory form with "What" + noun phrase + subject + verb expresses surprise or strong feeling about the carefree life.

(h) A simple man is the happiest person among us.
Explanation: Superlative uses "the + adjective + noun" to show the highest degree of happiness within the group.

(i) Let everyone like simplicity.
Explanation: Imperative for a general command or wish uses "Let" + object (everyone) + base verb to address all persons.

(j) So, everyone should lead a simple life.
Explanation: Active voice makes "everyone" the subject performing the action; it changes "should be led by all" into the corresponding active form.

Question #3 (ID: 481354)

Type: CQ | Book: English 2nd Paper | Years: 2022 | Boards: Dhaka Board | Tags: Dhaka Board

Question:
(a) Bangladesh is a low-lying country. (Change it into Interrogative)

(b) Every year natural disasters visit us. (Change it into passive voice)

(c) Who does not know the consequence of Tsunami? (Change it into Assertive sentence)

(d) The recent flood was very devastating. (Change it into Exclamatory sentence) 

(e) Dhaka is the most risky city in the earthquake zone. (Change it into positive degree)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Isn't Bangladesh a low-lying country?

(b) We are visited by natural disasters every year.

(c) Everyone/Everybody knows the consequence of Tsunami.

Or, All know the consequence of Tsunami.

(d) How devastating the recent food was!

(e) No other city is as risky as Dhaka in the earthquake zone.

Or, No other city in the earthquake zone is as risky as Dhaka.

Explanation:
(a) "Is Bangladesh a low-lying country?"  
To form an interrogative in present simple, invert the auxiliary verb "is" and the subject "Bangladesh."

(b) "Every year we are visited by natural disasters."  
In passive voice the object "us" becomes the subject "we" and the active verb "visit" becomes "are visited" to match present simple tense.

(c) "Everyone knows the consequences of a tsunami."  
An assertive sentence states the idea directly; replace the interrogative "Who does not know..." with the universal affirmative "Everyone knows..."

(d) "How devastating the recent flood was!"  
For exclamation with an adjective use "How + adjective + subject + verb" to show strong feeling about how devastating the flood was.

(e) "Dhaka is a risky city in the earthquake zone."  
Change the superlative "the most risky" to the positive degree "risky"; the sentence then simply states the quality without comparison.

Question:
(a) Computer is one of the greatest inventions of modern science. (Make it positive)

(b) In fact, it is a blessing of science. (Make it negative without changing the original meaning.)

(c) It has facilitated the world very greatly. (Make it exclamatory)

(d) Moreover, it has lessened our workloads. (Make it passive)

(e) So, we should use it in our everyday life. (Make it imperative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Very few inventions of modern science are as great as computer.

(b) In fact, it is not a curse of science.

(c) How greatly it has facilitated the world!

(d) Moreover, our workloads have been lessened by it.

(e) So, let us use it in our everyday life.

Explanation:
ক The computer is one of the greatest inventions of modern science. Explanation: The sentence is already positive (affirmative); adding "The" makes it grammatically complete and natural.

খ In fact, it is not a curse of science. Explanation: A negative form using the antonym "curse" preserves the original positive meaning by denying the opposite.

গ How greatly it has facilitated the world! Explanation: An exclamatory sentence uses "How" + subject + verb to express strong feeling about the degree of facilitation.

ঘ Moreover, our workloads have been lessened by the computer. Explanation: In passive voice the object ("our workloads") becomes the subject and the verb changes to "have been lessened," with the agent introduced by "by."

ঙ Use it in your everyday life. Explanation: An imperative sentence gives a direct command; the subject "you" is omitted and the verb starts the sentence.

(b) The province of a powerful prince was once attacked by young Taimur. (Active)

(c) He captured a large village. (Passive)

(d) The army killed Taimur's all soldires. (Negative)

(e) He did not disguise himself as a rich traveller to survive. (Affirmative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Taimur was one of the greatest conquerors of the world.

(b) Once young Taimur attacked the provinces of a powerful prince.

(c) A large village was captured by him.

(d) The army did not leave Taimur's any soldiers.

Or, No soldier of Taimur could escape being killed by the army.

(e) He disguised himself as a poor traveler to survive.

Explanation:
(a) "Taimur was one of the greatest conquerors of the world." — এখানে অর্থটি বোঝাতে আমরা "one of the + plural superlative (greatest)" ব্যবহার করি, কারণ বাক্যটি বলে যে খুব কম জয়ী তার সমান।

(b) "Young Taimur once attacked the province of a powerful prince." — passive থেকে active তে রূপান্তর করতে করেছে যিনি কাজটি করেছেন (Taimur) তাকে subject করে verb‑টাইম একই রেখে বাক্য সাজানো হয়েছে।

(c) "A large village was captured by him." (বা "A large village was captured by Taimur.") — passive বানাতে object‑কে subject করা হয় এবং মূল verb কে past participle দিয়ে "was + past participle" ব্যবহার করা হয়।

(d) "The army did not kill all of Taimur's soldiers." — negative past simple গঠনের জন্য "did not" + base verb (kill) ব্যবহার করা হয়; এছাড়া "soldires" → "soldiers" এবং "all of" সঠিক ক্রমানুসারে বসানো হয়েছে।

(e) "He disguised himself as a rich traveller to survive." — affirmative তৈরি করতে "not" সরিয়ে দিয়েছেন এবং past simple form "disguised" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।

Question:
(a) Only you can do the work. (Negative)

(b) No other friend is as great as books. (Superlative)

(c) The rose is a very nice flower. (Exclamatory)

(d) We should be patriots. (Imperative)

(e) He called it laurel. (Passive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) None but you can do the work.

(b) Books are the greatest friend.

(c) What a nice flower the rose is!

(d) Let us be patriots.

(e) It was called laurel by him.

Explanation:
(a) Only you can do the work. (Negative)  
The word "only" excludes all others and gives the sentence a negative sense equivalent to "No one else can do the work," so it functions as a negative (restrictive) form.

(b) No other friend is as great as books. (Superlative)  
"No other" plus the comparison shows that none equals books, implying books are the greatest among friends, so the sentence conveys a superlative idea.

(c) The rose is a very nice flower. (Exclamatory)  
When expressed with strong feeling or an exclamation intonation (or recast as "What a very nice flower the rose is!"), the sentence becomes exclamatory because it emphasizes admiration.

(d) We should be patriots. (Imperative)  
Although it uses "should," the sentence gives a moral instruction or urging to a group (hortatory sense), so it functions as an imperative/advisory sentence.

(e) He called it laurel. (Passive)  
To make this passive you promote the object to subject: "It was called laurel by him." The sentence can therefore be expressed in passive voice by using "be" + past participle.

Question:
(a) The government has almost completed the construction of the Padma Bridge. (Passive)

(b) This is the largest bridge of Bangladesh. (Comparative degree)

(c) The countrymen will be very happy when it will be opened for use. (Exclamatory)

(d) It is a mega project. (Negative)

(b) This is larger than any other bridge of Bangladesh.

(c) How happy the countrymen will be when it will be opened for use!

(d) It's not a small project.

(e) Let us go to visit it.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক The construction of the Padma Bridge has almost been completed by the government. Passive করতে কৃতকারক (the government) কে "by" নিয়ে বাক্যের শেষে রাখা হয় এবং মূল বাক্যের অবজেক্ট (the construction) কে সাবজেক্ট করা হয়; টেন্স অর্থাৎ present perfect রাখতে "has been completed" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে এবং "almost" যথাযথভাবে "been"–এর আগে রাখা হয়েছে। 

খ This bridge is larger than any other bridge in Bangladesh. Comparative degree এ তুলনা দেখাতে "larger than" ব্যবহৃত হয়—superlative "largest" বদলে comparative দিয়ে দুটি বা ততোধিক বস্তুর মধ্যে তুলনা করা হয়। 

গ How happy the countrymen will be when it is opened for use! Exclamatory sentence তৈরিতে "How + adjective + subject + verb" প্যাটার্ন ব্যবহার করা হয়; পাশাপাশি "when it is opened"—এখানে ভবিষ্যৎকলের জন্য "will" পুনরাবৃত্তি দরকার নেই। 

ঘ It is not a mega project. Negative বানাতে "is" এর পরে "not" যোগ করা হয়ে বাক্যকে নেগেটিভ করা হয়। 

ঙ Let's visit it. Imperative বা আদেশ/পরামর্শ জানাতে প্রথমপদে "Let's" (let us) ব্যবহার করলে "আমরা যাই"—ধরনের অনুরোধ/আদেশ প্রকাশ পায়; সংক্ষিপ্ত করে "Let's visit it." বলা যায়۔

Question:
(a) The freedom fighters are considered to be the real heroes of our country. (Active)

(b) Their contribution will never be forgotten. (Affirmative)

(c) Their sacrifice is greater than any other thing. (Positive)

(d) By taking proper steps, we can improve their condition. (Negative)

(e) We must show proper respect to them. (Passive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) We consider the freedom fighters to be the real heroes of our country.

(b) Their contribution will always be remembered.

(c) No other thing/ Nothing is as great as their sacrifice.

(d) Without taking proper steps, we cannot improve their condition.

(e) Proper respect must be showed to them.

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) Active: Change the passive verb phrase "are considered to be" into an active clause with an agent: "People consider the freedom fighters the real heroes of our country." The subject of the passive becomes the object and a doer (people) is added.

(b) Affirmative: Replace the negative idea "will never be forgotten" with an affirmative equivalent: "People will always remember their contribution." "Never forgotten" ↔ "always remembered" changes negation to affirmation.

(c) Positive: Turn the comparative "is greater than any other thing" into the positive degree: "Their sacrifice is great." This removes the comparative structure and uses the base adjective.

(d) Negative: Introduce negation using an auxiliary or a clause like "unless": "Unless proper steps are taken, we cannot improve their condition." The negative is formed by "cannot" (or by adding "not") and/or by using "unless."

(e) Passive: Make the object the subject and keep the modal verb "must": "They must be shown proper respect." The original object ("them") becomes the subject of the passive and "must" remains with the past participle.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:
ক বাক্যটি কোনো নেতিবাচকতা ছাড়া একটি সাধারণ ঘোষণা/ধনাত্মক বাক্য, তাই "Positive" সঠিক।  
খ বাক্যটিও ধনাত্মক; এতে নেগেটিভ কোনো উপাদান নেই, তাই "Negative" ভুল — সঠিক হলো ধনাত্মক/ঘোষণামূলক।  
গ "We must learn..." একটি বাধ্যতামূলক/দাবি বোঝানো বাক্য (modal/obligation), এটি সরাসরি আদেশ-ধর্মী নির্ম্দেশ নয়, তাই "Imperative" সঠিক নয়।  
ঘ "Computer helps us a lot." এ বাক্যে বিষয় (computer) কাজটি করছে, তাই এটি সক্রিয় কণ্ঠ (active voice); "Passive" ভুল।  
ঙ বাক্যটি কেবল কারণে বোঝাচ্ছে এবং সাধারণ ঘোষণামূলক; আগ্রহ বা বিস্ময়ের চিহ্ন নেই, তাই "Exclamatory" ভুল।

Question:
(a) Honesty is the best way of leading life. (Positive)

(b) This noble virtue is always appreciated. (Active)

(c) Honesty can open a door of peace before a person. (Negative)

(d) Honesty is a very important virtue. (Exclamatory)

(e) So, we should never be dishonest. (Imperative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) No other way of leading life is so/as good as honesty.

(b) People always appreciate this noble virtue

(c) Honesty cannot close a door of peace before a Person.

Or, Can't honesty open a door of peace before a person?

Or, Dishonesty can't open a door of peace before a person?

Or, It is not that honesty can't open a door of peace before a person.

(d) What an important virtue honesty is!

(e) So, let us not ever be dishonest.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক ধনাত্মক (affirmative) বাক্য হলো নেগেটিভ কনট্রাকশন ছাড়া সরাসরি কোনো কথা বলার বাক্য; "Honesty is the best way of leading life." কোনো না নেই, তাই এটি ধনাত্মক বাক্য।  

খ সক্রিয় (active) বাচ্য হলে বিষয়টি কাজ করে; passive "is appreciated" কে active করে বানালে হবে "People always appreciate this noble virtue." — এখানে subject (people) কাজটি করছে, তাই active।  

গ নেতিবাচক (negative) বাক্যে না/কেনই বা বিরোধী অংশ থাকে; "Honesty can open..." এর নেতিবাচক হবে "Honesty cannot open a door of peace before a person." — এখানে "cannot" যোগ হওয়ায় বাক্যটি নেগেটিভ হয়ে গেছে।  

ঘ উত্সাহসূচক (exclamatory) বাক্য অনুভূতি প্রকাশ করে এবং বিস্ময়চিহ্ন (!) দিয়ে শেষ হয়; উদাহরণ: "What a very important virtue honesty is!" — এর ভাষা শক্তভাবে অনুভূতি প্রকাশ করছে, তাই exclamatory।  

ঙ অনুদের (imperative) বাক্য আদেশ বা নির্দেশ দেয় এবং সাধারণত ক্রিয়াপদ দিয়ে শুরু হয়; "Never be dishonest." এভাবে সরাসরি নির্দেশ থাকার কারণে এটি imperative।

Question:
(a) Cricket is a very exciting game. (Exclamatory sentence)

(b) People of all ages enjoy this game. (Passive voice)

(c) It is played all over the world. (Active voice)

(d) At present, it is the most popular game in our country. (Comparative Degree)

(e) Though cricket is a costly game, people of all classes enjoy playing it. (Simple sentence)

(f)The game is played between two teams each consisting of eleven players. (Complex sentence)

(g) There are two umpires who conduct the game. (Simple sentence)

(h) It is full of thrill and excitement for the spectators. (Interrogative sentence)

(i) Bangladesh is a test-playing country developing its standard day by day. (Compound sentence)

(j) We must try our best to improve its present position. (Negative sentence without changing meaning)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
a To make it exclamatory we express strong feeling by using an exclamation or exclamatory structure, e.g. “What an exciting game cricket is!” or “Cricket is a very exciting game!” with an exclamation mark.

b In passive voice the object becomes the subject and we add “by …”, so “People of all ages enjoy this game” becomes “This game is enjoyed by people of all ages,” which shows the action received by the subject.

c Active voice names the doer as the subject; the active form is “People play it all over the world,” where “people” perform the action on “it.”

d Comparative degree uses “more … than” instead of “most,” so say “At present, it is more popular than other games in our country,” which directly compares two or more items.

e A simple sentence contains a single independent clause; combining the ideas without a subordinating conjunction gives a simple form like “Cricket is a costly game enjoyed by people of all classes,” using a participial phrase to keep it one clause.

f A complex sentence has a main clause plus a subordinate clause; for example, “The game is played between two teams, each of which consists of eleven players” has the main idea and a relative clause giving extra information.

g A simple declarative form removes the relative clause: “Two umpires conduct the game.” This is one independent clause stating a single fact.

h An interrogative sentence inverts the auxiliary and subject: “Is it full of thrill and excitement for the spectators?” uses subject–auxiliary inversion and a question mark to ask about the state.

i A compound sentence joins two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction: “Bangladesh is a test-playing country, and it is developing its standard day by day,” which links two equal ideas.

j To make it negative without changing the meaning use a phrase that denies failure, e.g. “We must not fail to try our best to improve its present position,” which keeps the original obligation but in negative form.

(c) Who is not now in the threat of violence? (Assertive)

(d) Terrorism is more disastrous than anything. (Positive)

(e) It is one of the most corrosive problems of the modern world. (Comparative)

(f) Nobody wants his children to be terrorist in future. (Interrogative)

(g) Though there is law to punish the terrorists, it is not properly applied. (Simple)

(h) By applying the law properly, we can get rid of it. (Complex)

(i) We have to create social awareness to fight against corruption. (Compound)

(j) We all should avoid the killers of mankind. (Negative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
ক The sentence is a simple declarative (assertive) statement giving information and ends with a full stop, so it is not exclamatory; an exclamatory sentence would show strong emotion and use an exclamation form. 

খ This is passive voice: the verb phrase "is called" shows the subject receives the action; an active form would be "People call it a challenge." 

গ It is an interrogative sentence because it begins with the question word "Who" and asks a question, so it cannot be classified as assertive. 

ঘ The adjective "more disastrous" expresses comparison, so the sentence is comparative in degree, not positive. 

ঙ The phrase "one of the most corrosive" uses the superlative "most," so this is a superlative-degree expression, not merely comparative. 

চ This is an assertive (declarative) negative idea—"Nobody wants…" states a fact and ends with a period, so it is not interrogative. 

ছ The sentence contains a subordinate clause introduced by "Though…" plus a main clause, so it is a complex sentence rather than a simple one. 

জ Although it begins with a participial phrase ("By applying the law properly"), the structure has only one independent clause ("we can get rid of it"), so grammatically it is a simple sentence. 

ঝ This line expresses a single idea with one independent clause ("We have to create…"), so it is a simple sentence, not a compound sentence. 

ঞ The sentence gives a positive/affirmative instruction ("should avoid"), so it is not negative; a negative sentence would include words like "not" or "never."

Question:
(a) Health is wealth. (Make complex sentence)

(b) A healthy poor man is happier than a sick moneyed man. (Use positive degree)

(c) Though a healthy man is an asset to his family, an unhealthy man is a liability. (Make compound sentence)

(d) He can succeed in life. (Make interrogative sentence)

(e) So, everybody cannot but be conscious of his health. (Make affirmative sentence)

(f) Everybody must take care of his health all the time. (Make negative sentence)

(g) Health can be improved by regular physical exercise and a balanced diet. (Use active voice)

(h) People who are poor cannot afford to take a balanced diet. (Make simple sentences)

(i) They are very concerned with the quantity of food. (Make exclamatory)

(j) Everybody should know it that malnutrition causes weakness. (Use passive voices)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Because health is wealth, one should take care of it.
Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it has a subordinate clause ("Because health is wealth") that gives a reason and a main clause ("one should take care of it").

(b) A healthy poor man is not less happy than a sick moneyed man.
Explanation: The positive degree uses the base adjective "happy"; adding "not less" expresses the same comparison without using the comparative form "happier."

(c) A healthy man is an asset to his family, but an unhealthy man is a liability.
Explanation: This is a compound sentence formed by joining two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction "but."

(d) Can he succeed in life?
Explanation: Forming an interrogative here requires inverting the auxiliary "can" and the subject "he."

(e) So, everybody must be conscious of his health.
Explanation: "Cannot but be conscious" means "must be conscious," so removing the negation yields the affirmative form.

(f) Everybody must not neglect his health at any time.
Explanation: A negative construction that preserves the original meaning uses "must not neglect" to show prohibition/avoidance.

(g) Regular physical exercise and a balanced diet can improve health.
Explanation: Changing to active voice makes the agents ("regular physical exercise and a balanced diet") the subject that performs the action on "health."

(h) People are poor. They cannot afford to take a balanced diet.
Explanation: The relative clause ("who are poor") is split into a simple sentence about people’s condition and a separate simple sentence stating they cannot afford a balanced diet.

(i) How concerned they are about the quantity of food!
Explanation: An exclamatory sentence uses "How" + adjective to express strong feeling about their concern.

(j) It should be known by everybody that weakness is caused by malnutrition.
Explanation: The main clause is put into passive voice ("It should be known by everybody") and the fact is expressed passively ("weakness is caused by malnutrition").

Question:
(a) Wherever we may cast our eyes, we notice the achievement of science. (Make it simple)

(b) The electricity lights both the streets and the houses. (Make it negative)

(c) The radio broadcasts news, songs and lectures. (Make it passive)

(d) There is cinema to delight in the evening. (Make it complex)

(e) Computer is one of the most important inventions of modern science. (Make it positive)

(f) Who can go without it? (Make it assertive)

(g) Internet is as important as computer. (Make it comparative)

(h) It helps us to know about the world. (Make it compound)

(i) It is greater than all other inventions of modern science. (Make it superlative)

(j) The invention of computer is a great miraculous event. (Make it exclamatory)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
a We see the achievements of science everywhere.
Explanation: The complex phrase "Wherever we may cast our eyes" is simplified to the clear subject–verb–adverbial order "We see ... everywhere," keeping the original meaning but using a simple sentence.

b The electricity lights neither the streets nor the houses.
Explanation: To make the sentence negative for both items we use the correlative negative "neither ... nor," which negates lighting of both streets and houses.

c News, songs and lectures are broadcast by the radio.
Explanation: In passive voice the objects ("news, songs and lectures") become the subject, the verb becomes "are broadcast," and the original subject ("the radio") follows with "by."

d There is cinema in the evening that people can enjoy.
Explanation: This makes the sentence complex by adding a subordinate relative clause "that people can enjoy," which gives additional information about the evening cinema.

e The computer is an important invention of modern science.
Explanation: Changing "one of the most important" to "an important" converts the sentence from a superlative/ordinal idea to the positive degree, stating importance simply.

f No one can go without it.
Explanation: An assertive sentence states a fact; replacing the question with the declarative "No one can..." asserts the intended meaning directly.

g The internet is more important than the computer.
Explanation: To make a comparative, use "more ... than" to compare the two items, replacing the equal comparison "as ... as."

h It helps us, and it informs us about the world.
Explanation: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses ("It helps us" and "it informs us about the world") with the coordinating conjunction "and."

i It is the greatest of all the inventions of modern science.
Explanation: To form the superlative, use "the greatest" plus "of all" to show it ranks above every other invention.

j What a great and miraculous event the invention of the computer is!
Explanation: An exclamatory sentence begins with "What" + adjective(s) + noun and then the subject and verb, expressing strong feeling about the event.

Question:
(a) Haji Mohammad Mohsin was more gracious than any other man in this subcontinent. (Positive)

(b) He was born in Hoogli. (Complex)

(c) He inherited a vast property from his father and sister. (Interrogative without changing meaning)

(d) He did not misuse this wealth. (Passive)

(e) He is called a friend of humanity. (Active)

(f)He did not marry. (Affirmative)

(g) During his lifetime, he spent money lavishly to help the poor. (Compound)

(h) He was very kind to the poor: (Negative without changing meaning)

(i)One day when a thief entered his room, he caught him. (Simple)

(j)He caught the thief but did not punish him. (Complex)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) The original uses a comparative ("more ... than any other") which is equivalent to a superlative; to make the positive degree we use the base adjective with an intensifier (e.g. "very gracious"). This keeps the meaning but removes the comparative form.

(b) A complex sentence has a main clause plus a subordinate clause; add a relative or adverbial clause for extra information (e.g. "He was born in Hoogli, which is in Bengal") to make it complex.

(c) Past simple questions use the auxiliary "did" plus the base verb, so the interrogative form is "Did he inherit a vast property from his father and sister?" The main verb becomes the base form "inherit" and "did" marks the past.

(d) Passive of a past simple negative uses "was not" + past participle: "This wealth was not misused by him." The object becomes the subject and the agent is optional with "by."

(e) To change passive to active make the agent the subject: "People call him a friend of humanity." The verb changes accordingly and the object becomes the direct object.

(f) To express the same idea affirmatively without "not," use an adjective: "He remained unmarried." This affirmative form conveys the same meaning as "He did not marry."

(g) A compound sentence joins two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction; e.g. "He spent money lavishly to help the poor, and people benefited greatly from his generosity." This preserves the original idea while adding a second independent clause.

(h) Use the negative of an antonym to keep the meaning: "He was not unkind to the poor." Saying "not unkind" expresses the same positive idea without the original phrasing.

(i) A simple sentence has one subject and one predicate; combine the actions around a single subject: "One day a thief entered his room and was caught." Here "a thief" is the single subject with a compound predicate, making the sentence simple.

(j) Use a subordinating conjunction to form a complex sentence showing contrast: "Although he caught the thief, he did not punish him." The subordinate clause ("Although he caught the thief") plus the main clause make it complex.

Question:
(a) Man is the maker of his own fortune. (Interrogative)

(b) If he makes a proper use of his time, he is sure to prosper in life. (Simple)

(c) The person doing otherwise is sure to repent later. (Complex)

(d) The lazy suffer miserably in the long run. (Exclamatory)

(e)To kill time is to commit suicide. (Interrogative)

(f) Our life is nothing but a sum total of hours, days and years. (Assertive)

(g)Youth is the most valuable season of life. (Positive)

(h) In youth mind is soft and it can be shaped easily. (Simple)

(i) Unless you use the morning hours of life, you have to pay a heavy price afterwards. (Compound)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) This is an assertive (declarative) simple sentence because it states a fact with a single subject–predicate structure and ends with a full stop.

(b) This is a complex sentence: the subordinate conditional clause "If he makes a proper use of his time" depends on the main clause "he is sure to prosper in life," so there are two clauses with a dependent–independent relationship.

(c) This is a simple (assertive) sentence; "doing otherwise" is a participial phrase modifying "person," but the sentence contains only one main clause that makes a statement.

(d) This is an assertive simple sentence because it states a fact about a group in one independent clause; an exclamatory sentence would show strong emotion or use an exclamation mark.

(e) This is an assertive (declarative) sentence: an infinitive phrase serves as subject and predicate ("To kill time" = "to commit suicide"), so it makes a statement, not a question.

(f) This is an assertive (declarative) simple sentence because it gives a single factual statement about life in one main clause.

(g) This is an assertive sentence that uses the superlative degree ("most valuable"); it declares a fact and contains a superlative adjective, so it is not merely the positive degree.

(h) This is a compound sentence: it joins two independent clauses ("mind is soft" and "it can be shaped easily") with the coordinating conjunction "and."

(i) This is a complex sentence because the subordinate concessive/conditional clause "Unless you use the morning hours of life" depends on the main clause "you have to pay a heavy price afterwards," so one clause is dependent on the other.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
(a) Man is the best creation of God. (Comparative)

(b) Isn’t it our responsibility to do good deeds? (Assertive)

(c) Our life is not measured by months or years. (Active)

(d) Honest people lead a happy life. (Complex)

(e) It matters little if a man lives many years or not. (Interrogative)

(f) Nobody is absolutely happy on earth. (Affirmative)

(g)So, we should not waste time in vain. (Passive)

(h) If we use time properly, we can be benefited. (Simple)

(i) All men must die. (Negative)

(j) Though we take utmost care, we cannot avoid death. (Compound)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "Man is the best creation of God." → Comparative: change the superlative "best" to the comparative "better" and add a comparison, e.g. "Man is better than other creations of God." This is because comparative degree (better) compares two or more items and uses "than" to show the comparison.

(b) "Isn’t it our responsibility to do good deeds?" → Assertive: make it a statement: "It is our responsibility to do good deeds." Turn the question into a declarative sentence by removing inversion and the negative auxiliary ("Isn't") and using the affirmative verb form.

(c) "Our life is not measured by months or years." → Active: make the agent the subject, e.g. "Nobody measures our life by months or years." Passive "is measured" becomes active "measures" and you supply a subject (nobody/people) while keeping the negation.

(d) "Honest people lead a happy life." → Complex: add a subordinate clause to show reason or condition, e.g. "Honest people lead a happy life because they have peace of mind." A complex sentence has one independent clause plus a dependent (subordinate) clause like "because…" to show cause or condition.

(e) "It matters little if a man lives many years or not." → Interrogative: form a question: "Does it matter if a man lives many years or not?" Turn the statement into a question by inserting the auxiliary "does" and inverting the subject and auxiliary.

(f) "Nobody is absolutely happy on earth." → Affirmative: express the same idea without a negative word, e.g. "Everyone has some unhappiness on earth." To convert a negative sentence to an affirmative equivalent, replace the negative subject ("nobody") with a positive subject ("everyone") and rephrase the predicate to keep the original meaning.

(g) "So, we should not waste time in vain." → Passive: make "time" the subject, e.g. "So, time should not be wasted in vain (by us)." In passive voice the object of the active sentence becomes the subject, and the verb becomes a form of "be" + past participle; the agent ("by us") is optional.

(h) "If we use time properly, we can be benefited." → Simple: convert to a single independent clause, e.g. "We can benefit by using time properly." A simple sentence has one independent clause, so combine the idea into one clause (using a gerund or rephrasing) and use active verb "benefit."

(i) "All men must die." → Negative: put the statement in negative form, e.g. "All men do not live forever." This negates the predicate ("do not live forever") while preserving the original sense that mortality is inevitable.

(j) "Though we take utmost care, we cannot avoid death." → Compound: join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction, e.g. "We take utmost care, yet we cannot avoid death." A compound sentence links two independent clauses of equal rank using conjunctions like "and," "but," or "yet."

ব্যাখ্যা:

ক সঠিক: এটি একটি ইতিবাচক (affirmative) বাক্য কারণ বাক্যে নেগেশন নেই এবং একটি সরাসরি বক্তব্য করা হয়েছে।  

খ ভুল: বাক্যে কোনো উপনিবেশ (dependent clause) নেই, কেবল একটি প্রধান ক্রিয়া-বাক্য (modal + object) এবং একটি prepositional phrase রয়েছে; তাই এটি জটিল (complex) নয়, এটি সরল/simple বাক্য।  

গ ভুল: বাক্যটি active voice — subject "People" কাজটি করছে; passive হলে হবে "A corrupt man is hated by people." তাই এটি passive নয়।  

ঘ ভুল: "Nobody respects him." একটি ঘোষণামূলক (declarative) বাক্য, প্রশ্নবোধক হলে হবে "Does nobody respect him?" তাই এটি interrogative নয়।  

ঙ ভুল: বাক্যে "who takes bribe" নামধারা (relative clause) আছে, তাই এটি কেবল সরল বাক্য নয়; একটি উপবাক্যসহ হওয়ায় এটি complex sentence হিসেবে গণ্য হবে।  

চ ভুল: "Though we have strict law" একটি অসম্পূর্ণ (subordinate) concessive clause, এবং মূল বাক্য আছে — এটি compound নয়; এটি একটি complex বাক্য (subordinate + main clause)।  

ছ সঠিক: "No other person is as hated as a corrupt man." বাক্যটি তুলনামূলকভাবে সর্বোচ্চ ঘৃণার বিষয়টি প্রকাশ করে এবং অর্থটিতে superlative অর্থ আছে, তাই এটি superlative ধারণ করে।  

জ ভুল: বাক্যে প্রধান ধারা "We hope" এবং একটি that‑clause আছে ("that Bangladesh will be free…"), তাই এটি সরল নয়; এটি complex sentence (main + subordinate)।  

ট ভুল: "Everybody avoids a corrupt man." হল ইতিবাচক/affirmative বাক্য; নেতিবাচক (negative) হলে হবে "Nobody avoids…" বা "Everybody does not avoid…" তাই এটি negative নয়।  

ঠ ভুল: "A corrupt man leads a very unhappy life." একটি সাধারণ ঘোষণামূলক বাক্য;	exclamatory হলে বিশেষভাবে বিস্ময় বা শক্তি দেখাতে চিহ্ন ('How unhappy his life is!') ব্যবহার করা হয়, তাই এটি exclamatory নয়।

(a) Once upon a time there was a little girl and her name was Tarin.

(b) In spite of being a nice little girl, she was not an ordinary child.

(c) Didn't she pass her time in reading and writing?

d) Her parents did not dislike her at all.

e) She was praised by everyone.

f) How attentive she was to her study!

g) She also helped her mother when she was free.

h) Did she ever told a lie?

(i) Very few girls in the school were as intelligent as she.

j) She worked hard so that she could shine in life.

Explanation:
Explanation:
a This is a simple (declarative) sentence because it contains one independent clause; "Once upon a time" is just an introductory phrase, not a second clause.  
b This is a complex sentence because it has a subordinate clause introduced by "Though" ("Though she was a nice little girl") plus a main clause ("she was not an ordinary child"). The subordinate clause depends on the main clause, so the sentence is complex.  
c This is a simple declarative sentence with one independent clause stating an action; it is not a question.  
d This is an affirmative (positive) sentence because it states something directly without negation; the subject "Her parents" performs the action "liked."  
e This is active voice, not passive, because the subject "Everyone" performs the action "praised" rather than receiving it.  
f This is a simple declarative sentence (not exclamatory); it states a fact about her attentiveness in a neutral tone.  
g This is a simple sentence with a single independent clause ("She also helped her mother in her free time"), so it is not complex.  
h This is a negative declarative sentence because the adverb "never" negates the verb "told"; it is not an interrogative (no question form).  
i This expresses a superlative idea ("one of the most intelligent"), so it is not the positive degree; "most" shows a highest degree of comparison.  
j This is a simple sentence: one main clause ("She worked hard") with an infinitive phrase ("to shine in life") as purpose, but no additional clause, so it is not complex.

Question:
(a) Computer is one of the greatest inventions of modern science. (Positive) (b) Computer is a blessing on earth. (Negative) (c) Though it is a blessing, it has dark sides. (Simple) (d) Computers are nowadays being used in almost every sphere of life. (Active) (e) We cannot but depend on it. (Affirmative) (f) No one can deny its necessity.

(Compound) (j) Without computer, we cannot imagine our modern life. (Complex)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Correct: Positive (affirmative declarative). This sentence praises the computer and states a fact without any negation, so it is positive and declarative.  

(b) Correct classification is Positive, not Negative. The sentence expresses a favourable view (“a blessing”) and contains no negation, so it is positive.  

(c) Correct: Complex. The subordinating conjunction "Though" introduces a subordinate clause, so the sentence has a dependent clause plus a main clause, making it complex.  

(d) Correct: Passive. The verb phrase "are being used" is passive voice (the action is received by "computers"), not active.  

(e) Correct as Affirmative in meaning. Although it contains "cannot," the idiom "cannot but depend" means "must depend" (an affirmative meaning), so its force is affirmative.  

(f) Correct classification is Negative (declarative), not Interrogative. "No one" negates the sentence, so it is a negative declarative statement.  

(g) Correct: Superlative, not comparative. The word "most" shows the highest degree (superlative), whereas comparative would use "more."  

(h) Correct: Active. The subject "It" performs the action "helps," so the sentence is in active voice, not passive.  

(i) Correct: Simple (not compound). The sentence has a single independent clause with an adverbial phrase "Because of its usefulness," so it is a simple sentence.  

(j) Correct: Simple (not complex). "Without computer" is an introductory prepositional phrase and the rest is one independent clause, so the whole sentence is a simple declarative sentence.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Correct: Exclamatory. Reason: The sentence expresses strong feeling and would normally end with an exclamation mark, which makes it exclamatory.

(b) Correct label: Declarative (Assertive), not Interrogative. Reason: It states a fact and ends with a full stop, so it is a statement, not a question.

(c) Correct: Comparative. Reason: The structure "as … as" compares two things, showing degree of comparison.

(d) Correct label: Superlative, not Positive. Reason: "one of the most corrosive" uses "most," indicating the highest degree among a group.

(e) Correct label: Passive, not Active. Reason: The subject ("A terrorist") receives the action ("is hated"); the active form would be "People hate a terrorist."

(f) Correct: Interrogative, not Assertive. Reason: It asks a question beginning with "Who," so it is an interrogative sentence.

(g) Correct: Complex, not Compound. Reason: It has a subordinate clause introduced by "Though" plus a main clause, so one dependent and one independent clause (complex).

(h) Correct label: Simple (Declarative), not Complex. Reason: There is a single main clause with a participial phrase ("By applying…")—so it is a simple declarative sentence.

(i) Correct: Exclamatory, not Assertive. Reason: "What a miserable life…!" expresses strong feeling and is an exclamation.

(j) Correct label: Passive, not Active. Reason: The verb phrase "should be brought" is passive (the subject receives the action).

(j) People call it the seedtime of life. (লোকেরা একে জীবনের বীজ বপনের সময় বলে।)

Explanation:
(a) I am not sure that man is the maker of his own fortune.
Explanation: Negation is formed by inserting "not" after the auxiliary "am," which turns the affirmative certainty into its negative form.

(b) Use your time properly to shine in life.
Explanation: An imperative gives a direct command; here the verb "use" is in the base form addressing the reader to make the sentence imperative.

(c) By whom is it not known?
Explanation: To make the question passive, the object ("it") becomes the subject and the agent is expressed with "by," changing the structure while keeping the meaning.

(d) How miserably the lazy suffer in the long run!
Explanation: Exclamatory sentences often begin with "How" or "What" to emphasize feeling; here "How miserably..." expresses strong emotion about their suffering.

(e) Killing time is as harmful as committing suicide.
Explanation: Use of gerunds ("killing," "committing") and the structure "as ... as" makes a comparative of equality, showing two actions are equally harmful.

(f) Our life is not only a sum total of hours, days and years.
Explanation: Changing "only" to "not only" makes the sentence negative while implying there is more to life than just its measurable parts.

(g) Youth is a valuable season of life.
Explanation: Converting the superlative "most valuable" to the positive degree uses the base adjective "valuable," stating the quality without comparison.

(h) We can easily shape our minds in youth.
Explanation: Active voice makes the doer ("we") the subject and uses the verb "shape" directly; adverb placement "easily" modifies the verb.

(i) Utilize your time properly in youth.
Explanation: The imperative form uses the base verb "utilize" (or "use") to give a direct instruction to the reader.

(j) People call it the seedtime of life.
Explanation: To change from passive ("it is called") to active, introduce a subject ("People") who perform the action and use the verb "call."

Changing Sentences:

(a) We are not ungrateful to the freedom fighters. (মুক্তিযোদ্ধাদের প্রতি আমরা অকৃতজ্ঞ নই।)

(b) Their contribution is the greatest thing. (তাদের অবদান সবচেয়ে বড় জিনিস।)

(e) A freedom fighter is greater than any other son of the soil. (একজন মুক্তিযোদ্ধা দেশের যে কোনো সন্তানের চেয়ে বড়।)

(f) Our independence was got by us for their sacrifice. (তাদের আত্মত্যাগের বিনিময়ে আমাদের স্বাধীনতা অর্জিত হয়েছিল।)

(j) Some steps have been taken to improve their condition by the government. (তাদের অবস্থার উন্নতির জন্য সরকার কর্তৃক কিছু পদক্ষেপ গ্রহণ করা হয়েছে।)

Explanation:
(a) "We are not ungrateful to the freedom fighters."  
Explanation: Negation is formed by adding "not" or using the negative adjective "ungrateful"; here "are not ungrateful" expresses the negative of "are grateful."

(b) "Their contribution is the greatest."  
Explanation: Superlative degree uses "the" + adjective + "-est" (or "most"); "greatest" shows their contribution is highest among all.

(c) "Never disrespect or forget our martyrs."  
Explanation: Imperative sentences give commands and drop the subject "you"; the verbs start in base form ("disrespect", "forget") and "never" makes it a negative command.

(d) "They have built the national memorial to pay tribute to their memories."  
Explanation: To change passive to active, introduce the agent ("they") and use an active verb form ("have built") instead of "has been built."

(e) "A freedom fighter is greater than any other son of the soil."  
Explanation: Comparative degree compares two or more items using "greater than"; it replaces the superlative "greatest" with a comparative structure.

(f) "Our independence was won because of their sacrifice."  
Explanation: Passive form emphasizes the object ("our independence") by making it the subject and using a past passive verb phrase ("was won") while the agent may be omitted.

(g) "How bravely they fought to snatch the red sun of independence!"  
Explanation: Exclamatory sentences use "How" (with adverb) or "What" (with noun) + subject + verb to express strong feeling.

(h) "Their courage was powerful."  
Explanation: To put the sentence in the positive degree, remove the comparative "more ... than" and use the base adjective "powerful."

(i) "We will never forget their contribution."  
Explanation: Change passive ("will never be forgotten") to active by adding an agent ("we") and using an active verb ("will never forget").

(j) "Some steps have been taken by the government to improve their condition."  
Explanation: Passive is formed by making the object ("some steps") the subject and using the appropriate form of "be" + past participle ("have been taken"), with the agent added after "by."

Explanation:
Solution:
(a) Honesty cannot open a door of peace before a person.
Explanation: Changing the modal verb "can" to its negative form "cannot" makes the whole sentence negative while keeping the original meaning.

(b) The invitation was accepted by him.
Explanation: In passive voice the object "the invitation" becomes the subject, the verb uses auxiliary "was" + past participle "accepted", and the agent is expressed with "by him."

(c) Reading books is the noblest of all habits.
Explanation: Replace the comparative phrase "nobler than any other" with the superlative form "the noblest" and add "of all" to show it is highest in rank.

(d) What a very essential virtue it is to love one's country!
Explanation: Use the exclamatory "What..." construction plus "it is to..." to turn the statement into an exclamation expressing strong feeling.

(e) We do not measure our lives by months or years.
Explanation: This keeps the active voice with "we" as the subject and corrects to the natural plural "lives," expressing the same negative idea actively.

(f) Industry is more important for success than anything else.
Explanation: Change the superlative "the most important" into a comparative "more important ... than ..." and add a comparison phrase to complete it.

(g) She was very attentive to her studies.
Explanation: Convert the exclamatory "How attentive she was!" into a straightforward declarative sentence to make it assertive.

(h) Terrorism is a very corrosive problem of the modern world.
Explanation: Remove the superlative phrase "one of the most" and use the positive adjective "very corrosive" to express the idea in the positive degree.

(i) Let us do good deeds as our responsibility.
Explanation: Use the imperative-suggestive form "Let us" plus the base verb to turn the sentence into a command/suggestion.

(j) Not everybody is fond of glittering things.
Explanation: Placing "Not" before "everybody" makes the sentence negative without completely reversing the intended scope (unlike "Nobody," which is stronger).

Explanation:
(a) Copying in the exams is one of the greatest social crimes. (Positive Degree)

✅ Transformed: Very few social crimes are as great as copying in the exams.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: “One of the + superlative” → “Very few + plural noun + are as + positive degree + as...”

এখানে "one of the greatest" একটি superlative expression, যেটি positive রূপে রূপান্তর করতে হয় “Very few...” দিয়ে শুরু করে।

(b) It is a very serious crime. (Exclamatory)

✅ Transformed: How serious a crime it is!

📝 Explanation:

Rule: “It is a very + adjective + noun.” → “How + adjective + a + noun + it is!”

এখানে “very serious crime” কে Exclamatory করার জন্য “How” দিয়ে শুরু করে অভিপ্রায় প্রকাশ করা হয়েছে।

(c) A student copying in the exam only deceives himself. (Negative)

✅ Transformed: A student copying in the exam does not deceive anyone but himself.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Affirmative → Negative by using “does not... but” structure

“Only deceives himself” অর্থ বোঝাতে “does not deceive anyone but himself” ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।

(d) Copying in the exam cannot bring any benefit. (Passive)

✅ Transformed: No benefit can be brought by copying in the exam.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Passive Voice: object + auxiliary + be + past participle + by + agent

এখানে “bring” ক্রিয়াটিকে passive করতে “can be brought” করা হয়েছে এবং agent “copying in the exam” যোগ হয়েছে।

(e) What a shameful practice it is! (Assertive)

✅ Transformed: It is a very shameful practice.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Exclamatory → Assertive: “What a/an + adjective + noun it is!” → “It is a very + adjective + noun.”

“What a shameful practice it is!” একটি বিস্ময়বোধক বাক্য, যা assertive এ রূপান্তর করতে "very shameful practice" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।

(f) By resisting this malady, we can strengthen our education. (Passive)

✅ Transformed: Our education can be strengthened by resisting this malady.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Passive: object + can be + past participle + by + agent

"Strengthen" verb-কে passive করতে “can be strengthened” রূপ নেওয়া হয়েছে।

(g) We all should come forward to stop it and save our students. (Imperative)

✅ Transformed: Let us all come forward to stop it and save our students.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Suggestive imperative → “Let us...”

যেহেতু এখানে একটি সমষ্টিগত আহ্বান বা উৎসাহ জ্ঞাপন করা হয়েছে, তাই “Let us...” দিয়ে imperative রূপ করা হয়েছে।

(h) Our examination system should be moderated. (Active)

✅ Transformed: Someone should moderate our examination system.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Passive → Active: subject + modal + base verb + object

(i) Nothing is as hateful as copying in the exam. (Comparative)

✅ Transformed: Copying in the exam is more hateful than anything else.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Positive → Comparative: “Nothing is as + adjective + as...” → “Subject is more + adjective + than anything else.”

“Nothing is as hateful as...” মানে হলো সবকিছুর চেয়ে এটি বেশি ঘৃণ্য — তাই comparative রূপে প্রকাশ করা হয়েছে।

(j) The government is sincere in removing this crime. (Negative)

✅ Transformed: The government is not insincere in removing this crime.

📝 Explanation:

Rule: Affirmative → Negative: “is sincere” → “is not insincere”

Double negative না করে অর্থ অক্ষুন্ন রেখে নেতিবাচক রূপে প্রকাশ করা হয়েছে।

(j) Jackfruits look very beautiful in the trees. (গাছে কাঁঠাল খুব সুন্দর দেখায়।)

Explanation:
Solution:

(a) Jackfruit is a large fruit of Bangladesh.
Explanation: The original superlative phrase "one of the largest" is changed to the positive degree by using the adjective "large" without comparison.

(b) What a very juicy fruit it is!
Explanation: An exclamatory sentence expresses strong feeling; here we use "What a..." structure and an exclamation to show emphasis.

(c) It is considered very sweet.
Explanation: "Taste" as a linking verb does not take a natural passive, so we use "is considered" to form a passive that preserves the original meaning.

(d) It does not contain high calories.
Explanation: To make the sentence negative in the simple present, add the auxiliary "does not" before the base verb.

(e) Does everyone know it as our national fruit?
Explanation: Forming a yes/no question in present simple requires the auxiliary "does" and inversion of subject and verb.

(f) In summer, this fruit is not very available.
Explanation: Make the sentence negative by inserting "not" after the auxiliary verb "is."

(g) People mainly find it in the month of Jaishtha.
Explanation: Change the passive "is found" into an active form by introducing a doer ("people") and using the active verb "find."

(h) It is less costly than the mango.
Explanation: "Not as...as" is changed to a comparative form "less...than" to compare the two items directly.

(i) Eat the fruit to ensure nutrition.
Explanation: An imperative sentence gives a command or advice; remove the subject and use the base verb "eat."

(j) Jackfruits look very beautiful in the trees.
Explanation: Convert the exclamatory sentence into a plain assertive (declarative) sentence by stating the observation without exclamation.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Changing Sentences:

(a) I know the student. (আমি ছাত্রটিকে চিনি।)

(b) An interesting book was given to me by her. (তার দ্বারা আমাকে একটি মজার বই দেওয়া হয়েছিল।)

(c) Magura is not as old as Jashore. (মাগুরা যশোরের মতো পুরাতন নয়।)

(d) Truthfulness is better than any other quality of a person. (সত্যবাদিতা একজন ব্যক্তির অন্য যেকোনো গুণের চেয়ে উত্তম।)

(e) Dhaka is the most populous city in Bangladesh. (ঢাকা বাংলাদেশের সবচেয়ে জনবহুল শহর।)

(h) The student is very bright. (ছাত্রটি খুব মেধাবী।)

(i) Let us obey our teachers. (চলো আমরা শিক্ষকদের মান্য করি।)

(j) Let your health be taken care of. (তোমার স্বাস্থ্যের যত্ন নেওয়া হোক।)

Explanation:
(a) I know the student.
The passive "is known to me" is changed to active by making the agent "I" the subject and using the active verb "know".

(b) An interesting book was given to me by her.
To form the passive, the object "an interesting book" becomes the subject, the verb becomes "was given" and the agent is introduced with "by her".

(c) Jashore is not as young as Magura.
To convert a comparative to the positive form we use "not as + positive adjective + as" so "older than" becomes "not as young as" to keep the same meaning.

(d) Truthfulness is better than any other quality of a person.
"Best" (superlative) changes to comparative by saying "better than any other…" to compare truthfulness with all other qualities.

(e) Dhaka is the most populous city in Bangladesh.
To form the superlative we make the thing compared the subject and use "the most + adjective" to show it exceeds all others.

(f) My friend is never late.
"Always punctual" is expressed negatively by using the opposite adjective ("late") with "never" to keep the same meaning.

(g) What a great fool he is!
Exclamatory sentences with a noun phrase use the structure "What a + adjective + noun + subject + verb" to show strong feeling.

(h) The student is very bright.
An exclamatory "How bright the student is!" becomes an assertive statement by using "very" with the adjective.

(i) Obey your teachers.
To make an imperative, remove "we should" and use the base verb "Obey" addressed to the listener as a command.

(j) Let your health be taken care of.
The imperative "Take care of your health" is made passive by making "your health" the subject and using "let … be + past participle" to retain the command sense.

Question:
(a) Corruption is one of the worst evils. (Positive) (b) A corrupt man can do anything against morality. (Complex) (c) People hate a corrupt man. (Passive) (d) Nobody respects him. (Interrogative) (e) The man who takes bribe, is next to devil. (Simple) (f) Though we have strict law, we are still affected by this evil. (Compound) (g) No other person is as hated as a corrupt man. (Superlative) (h) We hope that Bangladesh will be free from this evil. (Simple) (i) Everybody avoids a corrupt man. (Negative) (j) A corrupt man leads a very unhappy life. (Exclamatory)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) This sentence uses "worst," the superlative form of the adjective "bad," so it expresses the highest degree and is a superlative sentence.  
(b) It is a simple sentence because it has a single independent clause (one subject and one predicate) and no subordinate clauses.  
(c) This is active voice: the subject "People" performs the action "hate"; the passive would be "A corrupt man is hated by people."  
(d) "Nobody respects him" is a negative declarative sentence because "nobody" negates the verb; an interrogative would ask, e.g. "Does anybody respect him?"  
(e) It is a complex sentence because the relative clause "who takes bribe" is a subordinate clause modifying "the man," attached to a main clause.  
(f) This is complex: "Though we have strict law" is a subordinate concessive clause and "we are still affected…" is the main clause, so they form a complex sentence (not a compound).  
(g) The phrase "No other person is as hated as a corrupt man" conveys that he is the most hated, i.e., it expresses a superlative comparison in meaning.  
(h) This is a complex sentence: the main clause "We hope" takes a subordinate noun clause "that Bangladesh will be free…" as its object, so it is not simple.  
(i) "Everybody avoids a corrupt man" is an affirmative simple sentence (one independent clause), so it is not negative.  
(j) This is a declarative/simple sentence stating a fact; an exclamatory version would use an exclamation form (e.g., "What an unhappy life a corrupt man leads!").

(a) Answer: Haji Muhammad Muhsin was generous.
Explanation: "More generous" is comparative; the positive degree uses the base adjective "generous" without comparison.

(b) Answer: He was born in Hoogly, where he spent his early years.
Explanation: This is complex because it has one main clause ("He was born in Hoogly") and one dependent relative clause ("where he spent his early years") that cannot stand alone.

Explanation: Past simple questions are formed by adding the auxiliary "did" and using the base form of the verb ("inherit"), with subject–auxiliary inversion.

Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it begins with a subordinate adverbial clause ("While he was alive") followed by the main clause describing his spending.

(h) Answer: He was kind, and he could not refuse anyone's request.
Explanation: This is a compound sentence: two independent clauses ("He was kind" and "he could not refuse anyone's request") joined by the coordinating conjunction "and."

(i) Answer: One night a thief broke into his room during his prayer.
Explanation: This is a simple sentence with a single independent clause; "during his prayer" is a prepositional phrase, not a subordinate clause.

(j) Answer: Although he caught the thief, he did not punish him.
Explanation: This is complex because it uses a subordinate concessive clause ("Although he caught the thief") plus a main clause ("he did not punish him"), showing contrast.

Explanation:
ক এই বাক্যটি একটি বিবৃতি, প্রশ্ন করে না এবং প্রশ্নচিহ্ন নেই; তাই এটি প্রশ্নবাচক (interrogative) নয়।  
খ বাক্যটি একক স্বাধীন ক্লজ; কোনো উপবাক্য নেই, তাই এটা জটিল (complex) নয়—এটি সরল বিবৃতি।  
গ এখানে নেগেশন নেই; “smooth and rapid” ইতিবাচক বর্ণনা, তাই এটি ঋণাত্মক (negative) বাক্য নয়।  
ঘ ঠিক আছে — একটি বিষয় (A man) ও তার উপর ক্রিয়াসমূহ (has, gets) একই স্বাধীন ক্লজে আছে, ফলে এটি সরল বাক্য।  
ঙ বাক্যটিতে কেবল একটি স্বাধীন ক্লজ আছে এবং কোনো উপবাক্য নেই, তাই এটি জটিল (complex) বাক্য নয়।  
চ এখানে "A student" বিষয় হিসেবে কাজ করে এবং নিজেই ক্রিয়া করে (can visit), তাই এটি সক্রিয় (active) কণ্ঠে; passive হলে হবে যেমন: "All the renowned libraries can be visited by a student."  
ছ এটি সাধারণ বিবৃতি যা পিরিয়াডে শেষ হওয়া উচিত; বিস্ময়বোধ জাগানোর জন্যে exclamatory বাক্যে বিশেষ রূপ বা উদ্ঘাটক চিহ্ন (উদাহরণ: What an…) থাকে, তাই এটি exclamatory নয়।  
জ বাক্যটি ইতিবাচক/affirmative কারণ এতে কোনো negation নেই; “one of the most popular” থাকা সত্ত্বেও বাক্যটি নেগেটিভ নয়।  
ঝ এখানে একমাত্র স্বাধীন ক্লজ আছে; “buy or choose” কেবল যৌগিক ক্রিয়া/বস্তুর অংশ — compound sentence হলে দুটি স্বাধীন ক্লজ থাকা প্রয়োজন।  
ঞ "What an amazing milestone…!" হলো বিস্ময়বোধপূর্ণ উচ্চারণ এবং বিস্ময়বাচক চিহ্ন আছে, তাই এটি exclamatory; assertive (সাধারণ বিবৃতি) নয়।

(j) Would that I could open a Facebook account. (Make it an assertive sentence)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Facebook is not a common social network.
Explanation: Form a negative by placing "not" after the verb "is" to negate the statement.

(b) Now, people are using it all over the world.
Explanation: Change passive to active by supplying a doer ("people") and using the active verb form ("are using").

(c) Does everybody use it?
Explanation: Make a present-simple question by adding the auxiliary "does" before the subject and using the base verb "use."

(d) Every student has a smart phone.
Explanation: Convert the negative expression "no student without" into an affirmative universal statement using "every" and "has."

(e) Nobody dislikes social networks.
Explanation: Change the interrogative "Who does not..." into a declarative by stating the negative in a simple affirmative clause ("Nobody dislikes...").

(f) Facebook is good.
Explanation: Replace the superlative "the best" with the positive (base) adjective "good" to express the positive degree.

(g) It gives pleasure and restricts our freedom to use it.
Explanation: Make a simple sentence by keeping one subject ("It") and giving it a compound predicate ("gives... and restricts..."), so only one independent clause remains.

(h) If you do not use it, you cannot keep pace with the modern world.
Explanation: Form a complex sentence by introducing a dependent conditional clause ("If you do not use it") and linking it to the main clause.

(i) We can get many new pieces of information by using it, and we can share them with others.
Explanation: Create a compound sentence by joining two independent clauses with "and," each clause able to stand alone.

Question #33 (ID: 481318)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type: CQ | Book: English 2nd Paper | Years: 2018 | Boards:  | Tags: All Board
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
(a) Very few conquerors of the world were so great as Taimur. (Superlative)

(b) The province of a powerful prince was once attacked by young Taimur. (Active)

(c) Entering the kingdom of the prince, he captured a large village. (Compound)

(d) The army killed Taimur’s all soldiers. (Passive)

(e) He disguised himself as a poor traveler to survive. (Complex)

(f) He came to a house and asked for something to eat. (Simple)

(g) There lived an old woman in the house. (Complex)

(h) The woman became sympathetic to see Taimur. (Interrogative)

(i) The food was very hot. (Exclamatory)

(j) Taimur was too hungry to wait. (Negative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Taimur was one of the greatest conquerors of the world.

(b) Once young Taimur attacked the province of a powerful prince.

(c) He entered the kingdom of the prince and captured a large village.

(d) Taimur's all soldiers were killed by the army.

(e) He disguised himself as a poor traveller so that he could/might survive.

(f) Coming to a house, he asked for something to eat.

(g) There lived in the house a woman who was old.

(h) In the house, there lived a woman who was old.

(h) Didn't the woman become sympathetic to see Taimur?

(i) How hot the food was!

(j) Taimur was so hungry that he could not wait.

Explanation:
a This expresses a superlative idea because it compares Taimur with almost all other conquerors ("very few ... so great as"), showing he stands at the highest degree of greatness.

b Incorrect — the sentence is passive: the subject ("The province") receives the action and the agent appears after "by" ("by young Taimur"); the active form is "Young Taimur once attacked the province of a powerful prince."

c Incorrect — this is complex, not compound: it has a main clause ("he captured a large village") and a dependent participial clause ("Entering the kingdom of the prince") that modifies it, so one independent plus one subordinate element.

d Incorrect — the sentence is active because "The army" is the doer performing the action "killed"; the passive version would be "All Taimur’s soldiers were killed by the army."

e Correct — it is complex: there is a main clause ("He disguised himself as a poor traveler") and a subordinate infinitive of purpose ("to survive"), so one independent clause plus a dependent purpose phrase.

f Correct — it's a simple sentence with one subject ("He") and a compound predicate ("came ... and asked"), so a single independent clause describing two actions by the same subject.

g Incorrect — this is simple, not complex: "There lived an old woman in the house" is a single independent clause (existential construction) with no subordinate clause.

h Incorrect — the sentence is declarative, not interrogative: it states a fact ("The woman became sympathetic...") and does not ask a question; an interrogative would use question word/order or a question mark.

i Incorrect — as written it is a declarative statement describing the food; an exclamatory sentence would show strong feeling or use exclamatory form (e.g., "How hot the food was!").

j Incorrect — the sentence uses the "too ... to ..." degree construction (affirmative) to show excess, not negation; a negative sentence would include "not" or another negative word.

(i) Every year a lot of people come here and (they) visit it.

(j) I wish I could visit the sea-beach.

Explanation:
(a) My friend invited me to pay a visit to Cox’s Bazar, which I gladly accepted.
Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it joins a main clause with a relative clause "which I gladly accepted," adding extra information about the invitation.

(b) I was not very glad.
Explanation: Adding "not" makes the sentence negative while keeping the same tense and subject.

(c) The invitation was accepted by me.
Explanation: Passive voice is formed by making the object ("the invitation") the subject and using the auxiliary "was" + past participle "accepted."

(d) My friend received me cordially.
Explanation: This is a simple sentence with one independent clause expressing a single complete idea.

(e) How excited I was to see the sea beach!
Explanation: An exclamatory sentence uses "How" + adjective to express strong feeling or surprise.

(f) It is a very large sea beach.
Explanation: The positive degree uses the base adjective "large" (here strengthened by "very") instead of the superlative "largest."

(g) It is more beautiful than many other sea beaches in the world.
Explanation: The comparative degree is formed with "more" + adjective and "than" to compare it with other beaches.

(h) People call it the pleasure seekers’ paradise.
Explanation: Active voice uses a clear subject ("People") performing the action ("call") on the object ("it").

(i) Every year a lot of people come to visit it, and they enjoy the beach.
Explanation: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses ("a lot of people come..." and "they enjoy...") with the coordinating conjunction "and."

(j) I wish I could visit the sea beach.
Explanation: This assertive (declarative) sentence states the speaker’s wish directly instead of the exclamatory form.

Explanation: Converted the passive "is respected by everybody" into active voice by making "everybody" the subject and "respects" the verb.

(i) Their contribution will always/ever be remembered.

(j) Some steps to improve their condition have been taken by the government.

or, Some steps have been taken by the government to improve their condition.

Explanation:
(a) "We are not grateful to the freedom fighters."  
Explanation: This is the negative form of the affirmative sentence; adding "not" after the verb "are" makes the sentence negative.

(b) "No other thing is as great as their contribution."  
Explanation: To change a superlative/comparative into the positive degree we use the structure "as + adjective + as"; this shows equality in positive form.

(c) "Some freedom fighters died in the Liberation War, and they are called martyrs."  
Explanation: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses ("Some freedom fighters died..." and "they are called martyrs") with a coordinating conjunction "and."

(d) "The National Memorial has been built so that people may pay tribute to their memories."  
Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it has a main clause and a subordinate purpose clause ("so that...") showing why the memorial was built.

(e) "A freedom fighter is greater than any other son of the soil."  
Explanation: A comparative sentence uses "greater than" to compare one thing with others, replacing the superlative "greatest."

(f) "They fought bravely and snatched the red sun of independence."  
Explanation: This is a simple sentence with one subject "They" and a compound predicate ("fought... and snatched..."), so it remains simple.

(g) "What a passionate woman Mother Teresa was!"  
Explanation: An exclamatory sentence expresses strong feeling; beginning with "What" and reordering the clause makes it exclamatory.

(h) "Their weapons were ordinary, but they had much courage in their minds."  
Explanation: Turning the subordinate contrast into two independent clauses joined by "but" makes it a compound sentence that shows contrast.

(i) "People will always remember their contribution."  
Explanation: To make the sentence affirmative, remove the negation "never" and use a positive adverb "always," here with an active subject "People."

(j) "Some steps have been taken by the government to improve the condition."  
Explanation: Converting the active sentence to passive makes the object "some steps" the subject and uses the correct tense form "have been taken" to match present perfect.

(h) How interesting some books are!

(i) If we read books, we can build up a developed society.

(j) Only books can remove the darkness of ignorance.

Explanation:
(a) We should read books because they help us gain knowledge.
Explanation: Using "because" joins an independent clause and a subordinate clause, so the sentence becomes complex and shows reason.

(b) We are introduced to the realm of knowledge by books.
Explanation: The object "us" becomes the subject and the doer "books" is placed after "by", forming the passive voice.

(c) Do the books of great writers contain noble thoughts and great ideas?
Explanation: For present simple questions we add the auxiliary "do" before the subject to form an interrogative sentence.

(d) Reading books enriches our minds.
Explanation: This is a single independent clause with a gerund subject, so it is a simple sentence expressing one complete idea.

(e) Books are great friends.
Explanation: Replacing the superlative "greatest" with the positive degree "great" produces the positive form.

(f) They do not give us either knowledge or pleasure.
Explanation: To make a negative of "both ... and" we use "do not" plus "either ... or" to negate the two items.

(g) They are our real friends, and they remain with us in time of danger.
Explanation: Two independent clauses are joined with the coordinating conjunction "and," making the sentence compound.

(h) How interesting some books are!
Explanation: Using "How" + adjective + subject + verb forms an exclamatory sentence showing strong feeling.

(i) If we read books, we can build up a developed society.
Explanation: Beginning with "if" creates a subordinate (conditional) clause plus a main clause, so the sentence becomes complex.

(j) Only books can remove the darkness of ignorance.
Explanation: Replacing the negative phrase "Nothing but" with the affirmative limiter "Only" produces an affirmative sentence.

Question:
(a) There was an old man in a village. (Interrogative) (b) He was very poor but honest. (Complex) (c) He was one of the best cap makers with palm leaves. (Positive) (d) He sold them in the neighbouring market. (Voice change) (e) Earning money in this way, he thus maintained his family. (Compound) (f) One day he could not but go to a market. (Affirmative) (g) The market was far from his house. (Negative) (h) He had a basket full of caps. (Complex) (i) He was too tired to walk. (Compound) (j) He sat under the tree and fell asleep. (Simple)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Wasn't there an old man in a village?

(b) Though he was very poor, he was honest.

(c) Very few cap makers with palm leaves were so/as good as he.

(d) They were sold in the neighbouring market by him.

(e) He earned money in this way and thus maintained his family.

(f) One day he had to go to a market.

(g) The market was not near his house.

(h) He had a basket which was full of caps.

(i) He was very tired and could not walk.

(j) Sitting under the tree, he fell asleep.

Explanation:
(a) Was there an old man in the village? — Change to a question by inverting the auxiliary verb "was" before the subject; "There was..." becomes "Was there...?" to form an interrogative.

(b) Though he was very poor, he was honest. — This is complex because a subordinate clause ("Though he was very poor") is joined to the main clause to show contrast, so one clause depends on the other.

(c) He was a good cap maker with palm leaves. — "One of the best" is a superlative; the positive degree replaces it with "good" to state the quality without comparison.

(d) They were sold by him in the neighbouring market. — Passive voice makes the object ("them") the subject and uses the appropriate auxiliary + past participle, with the agent added by "by him."

(e) He earned money in this way, and thus he maintained his family. — Two independent clauses ("He earned..." and "he maintained...") are joined with the coordinating conjunction "and," making a compound sentence.

(f) One day he had to go to a market. — "Could not but go" is a negative idiom meaning necessity; the affirmative equivalent is "had to go," keeping the same meaning in positive form.

(g) The market was not near his house. — To make it negative, negate the statement by inserting "not" and restating the idea in opposite terms while keeping tense and subject.

(h) He had a basket that was full of caps. — A relative clause ("that was full of caps") modifies "basket," creating a complex sentence with a main clause plus a dependent clause.

(i) He was too tired, so he could not walk. — Two related independent clauses expressing cause and effect are joined by "so," forming a compound sentence.

(j) He sat under the tree and fell asleep. — This is a simple sentence because it has one subject ("He") with a compound predicate ("sat... and fell asleep"), so it remains a single independent clause.

(b) The examinees/The students should not elaborate any answer in the examination.

(c) After getting/Getting the question paper, he should read it carefully.

(d) At first glance, the questions may not seem easy.

(e) A student should attempt to answer all the questions so that s/he can/may get good marks.

(f) Seeing answering all the question by an examinee, the examiner become glad.

(g) But not answering at all is not as/so good as it.

(h) How sensible it is!

(i) Time by doing it should not be wasted by the examinee.

(j) Follow this process or you cannot bring a good result in an examination.

Explanation:
(a) The label “Comparative” is incorrect; the sentence uses the superlative phrase “most important,” so it is a superlative statement, not comparative—comparative would use “more important.”

(b) The label “Active” is incorrect; “should not be elaborated” is passive voice (modal + past participle). An active form would be “You should not elaborate any answer.”

(c) This is a complex sentence because it has a subordinate adverbial clause “When he gets the question paper” plus the main clause “he should read it carefully,” so there are two clauses with a dependent–independent relationship.

(d) The label “Negative” is wrong; the sentence is affirmative (positive) in meaning—“may seem difficult” expresses a possibility, not a negation.

(e) The label “Complex” is incorrect; this is a simple sentence with one finite verb phrase “should attempt” and an infinitive phrase of purpose “to get good marks,” so it contains only one independent clause.

(f) The label “Simple” is incorrect; this is a complex sentence because it begins with the conditional subordinate clause “If an examinee answers all the questions” followed by the main clause “the examiner becomes glad to see that.”

(g) The label “Positive” is acceptable: the sentence is affirmative (not negative). Although it contains a comparative “better than,” it is a positive/affirmative statement rather than a negative one.

(h) The label “Exclamatory” is incorrect; the sentence is a plain declarative statement (“It is really sensible”), not formed or punctuated as an exclamation.

(i) The label “Passive” is incorrect; this is an active sentence with a modal verb (“should not waste”) where the subject “The examinee” performs the action—passive would be “Time should not be wasted by the examinee.”

(j) The label “Compound” is incorrect; the sentence is simple: it has one independent clause “you cannot bring a good result in an examination” with a prepositional/participial phrase “Without following this process” serving as an adverbial modifier, not a second independent clause.

(h) He was very kind to the poor. (Negative)

(i) One night when he was saying his prayer, a theif broke into his room. (Simple)

(j) He caught the thief but didn’t punish him. (Complex)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) No other man in this subcontinent was so/as generous as Haji Muhammad Mohsin.

(b) It is Hoogly where he was born. / Hoogly is the place where he was born.

(c) Didn't he inherit a vast property from his father and sister?

or. Did he not inherit a vast property from his father and sister?

(d) This wealth was not misused by him.

(e) People/We call him a friend of humanity.

(f) He was unmarried.

Or, He was a bachelor.

Or. He was single.

(g) During his lifetime, he spent money lavishly and helped the poor.

Or, He wanted to help the poor and so he spent money lavishly during his life time.

(h) He was not at all cruel/unkind to the poor.

(i) One night, at the time of his saying prayer, a thief broke into his room.

Or, One night during his prayer, a thief broke into his room.

(j) Though/Although he caught the thief, he did not punish him.

Explanation:
a Correct classification: Superlative. The sentence compares him with every other man ("more ... than any other"), which expresses the highest degree; the positive degree would be just "generous" without comparison.

b Correct classification: Simple sentence. It has a single independent clause ("He was born in Hoogly") with no subordinate clause or coordinated clause, so it is simple rather than complex.

c Correct classification: Declarative (statement). The sentence states a fact; an interrogative would be formed as "Did he inherit a vast property...?" so the given form is not a question.

d Correct classification: Active (negative). The subject "He" performs the action ("did not misuse"), so it is active voice with negation; the passive would be "This wealth was not misused by him."

e Correct classification: Passive. "He is called a friend of humanity" shows the subject receiving the action (being called), so it is passive, not active.

f Correct classification: Negative. "He didn't marry" contains negation ("didn't"), so it is a negative sentence; the affirmative form would be "He married."

g Correct classification: Simple sentence. It contains one main clause with adverbials ("During his life time, he spent...") and no second independent clause, so it is not compound.

h Correct classification: Affirmative. "He was very kind to the poor" affirms a quality and contains no negation, so it is affirmative, not negative.

i Correct classification: Complex sentence. It has a main clause ("a thief broke into his room") plus a subordinate time clause ("when he was saying his prayer"), so it is complex.

j Correct classification: Compound sentence. It joins two independent clauses ("He caught the thief" and "didn’t punish him") with the conjunction "but," so it is compound rather than complex.

Question:
(a) Who does not want to succeed in life? (Assertive)

(b) It is not an easy thing. (Affirmative)

(c) Being industrious, everyone can prosper in life. (Negative)

(d) The idle always lag behind. (complex)

(e) We must work hard so that we can earn money. (simple)

(f) By working hard, we can improve our lot. (compound)

(g) The light of prosperity can be seen by a hard working person. (Active)

(h) Women should work as much as men. (comparative)

(i) We should remember that industry is the key to success. (passive)

(j) An idle man leads a very miserable life. (Exclamatory)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Everybody wants to succeed in life.

Or, There is nobody but wants to succeed in life.

(b) It is a difficult thing.

(c) Without being industrious, no one can prosper in life.

Or, Being lazy/idle, none can prosper in life.

(d) Those who are idle, always lag behind.

(e) We must work hard to earn money.

(f) We will work hard and thus we can improve our lot.

(g) A hard-working person can see the light of prosperity.

(h) Women should not work less than men.

(i) It should be remembered by us that industry is the key to success.

Or, That industry is the key to success should be remembered by us.

(j) What a miserable life an idle man leads!

Explanation:
(a) Who does not want to succeed in life? — This is an interrogative sentence because it asks a question beginning with the question word "Who", so it is not assertive.

(b) It is not an easy thing. — This is negative: the word "not" negates the statement, so it is not an affirmative sentence.

(c) Being industrious, everyone can prosper in life. — This is affirmative because the main clause ("everyone can prosper") affirms a positive possibility; the opening participle phrase does not make it negative.

(d) The idle always lag behind. — This is a simple declarative sentence with one subject and one predicate, so it is simple rather than complex.

(e) We must work hard so that we can earn money. — This is complex because it has a main clause ("We must work hard") plus a subordinate purpose clause ("so that we can earn money").

(f) By working hard, we can improve our lot. — This is a simple sentence: one main clause with an introductory participial phrase, not a compound (which would have two independent clauses).

(g) The light of prosperity can be seen by a hard working person. — This is passive voice because the subject ("the light of prosperity") receives the action and the agent appears in a "by" phrase; the active form would be "A hard-working person can see the light of prosperity."

(h) Women should work as much as men. — This is comparative (equality) because "as much as" compares the amount of work between women and men.

(i) We should remember that industry is the key to success. — This is active voice: the subject "we" performs the action "should remember"; it is not passive.

(j) An idle man leads a very miserable life. — This is a declarative/affirmative (assertive) sentence stating a fact; it is not exclamatory, which would express strong emotion or use an exclamation.

Question:
how dare you are to wake me up the lion roared i shall kill you for that please let me go the mouse cried i did not mean to wake you up

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"How daring you are to wake me up?" the lion roared. "I shall kill you for that." "Please, let me go." the mouse cried, "I did not mean to wake you up."

Explanation:
The correction is right because each spoken line is written as direct speech in quotation marks, begins with a capital letter, and ends with punctuation that matches the tone (an exclamation for anger, a period for a statement). When a speech tag follows in the same sentence, put a comma inside the closing quote before the tag (for example, "Please let me go," the mouse cried), but if the speech ends with an exclamation or question mark the strong punctuation stays inside the quotes and the tag is lowercased (for example, "How dare you wake me up!" the lion roared). These punctuation rules make it clear who is speaking and preserve the intended emotion.

Question:
(a) We should read books to acquire knowledge. (Make complex sentence)

(b) Books introduce us to the realm of knowledge. (Use passive voice)

(c) The books of great writers contain noble thoughts and great ideas. (Make interrogative sentence)

(d) By reading good books, we can enrich our mind. (Make compound sentence)

(e) Reading books is a very good habit. (Make exclamatory sentence)

(f) This habit is rarely disliked. (Affirmative)

(g) More and more books should be read. (Use active voice)

(h) No other thing is as interesting as reading books. (Use comparative degree)

(i) When we read good books, we discover new worlds. (Make simple sentence)

(f) Very few friends are as great as a good book. (Make superlative degree)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) We should read books so that we can acquire knowledge.

(b) We are introduced to the realm of knowledge by books.

(c) Don't the books of great writers contain noble thoughts and great ideas?

(d) We read books and we can enrich our mind.

(e) What a good habit reading books is!

(f) This habit is always/mostly/commonly/often liked.

(g) We should read more and more books.

(h) Reading books is more interesting than any other thing/anything.

(i) By reading good books, we discover new worlds.

Or. At the time of reading good books, we can discover new worlds.

(j) A good book is one of the greatest friends.

Explanation:
(a) We should read books so that we may acquire knowledge.  
This is a complex sentence because it has a main clause ("We should read books") and a subordinate purpose clause ("so that we may acquire knowledge").

(b) We are introduced to the realm of knowledge by books.  
Passive voice is formed with a form of "be" + past participle; the original object ("us"/"we") becomes the subject and "books" becomes the agent introduced by "by."

(c) Do the books of great writers contain noble thoughts and great ideas?  
To make it interrogative, place the auxiliary "do" before the subject ("the books") and keep the main verb in base form.

(d) By reading good books, we can enrich our mind, and we can broaden our knowledge.  
This is a compound sentence because it joins two independent clauses ("we can enrich our mind" and "we can broaden our knowledge") with the coordinating conjunction "and."

(e) What a very good habit reading books is!  
An exclamatory sentence uses "What..." (or "How...") to show strong feeling and inverts the usual order for emphasis.

(f) Most people like this habit.  
To make it affirmative, express the idea positively: "rarely disliked" becomes "liked by most people" (here phrased as "Most people like this habit").

(g) People should read more and more books.  
Active voice makes the doer ("People") the subject who performs the action, instead of the passive "books should be read."

(h) Reading books is more interesting than anything else.  
Use the comparative form "more ... than" to compare reading books with other things.

(i) Reading good books opens up new worlds.  
A simple sentence has a single independent clause; here "Reading good books" is the subject and "opens up new worlds" is the predicate.

(f) A good book is the best of friends.  
To form the superlative, use "best" to show the highest degree, replacing the comparative idea "as great as."

(j) The bear went away and he escaped himself. (Make it a complex sentence)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Once upon a time, there were two friends who were passing by a forest.

(b) Weren't they talking about their love for each other?"

(c) Suddenly they saw a bear coming towards them.

(d) It was the first friend who climbed up a tree.

(e) The latter was unable to climb up a tree.

(f) No way was found by him.

(g) Lying down on the ground, he feigned death.

(h) His ears, nose and face were smelt by the bear.

(i) He was thought that he was dead/The bear thought that he was dead/It was he who was thought to be dead.

(j) When the bear went away, he escaped himself.

Explanation:
(a) Complex sentence: Once upon a time, two friends were passing by a forest when they heard a rustling sound.
Explanation: This is complex because it has an independent clause ("two friends were passing by a forest") and a dependent time clause introduced by "when"; the dependent clause adds extra information and makes the sentence complex.

(b) Interrogative: Were they talking about their love for each other?
Explanation: Forming a question requires inversion of the auxiliary verb and the subject ("Were" + "they"), which turns the statement into an interrogative.

(c) Simple sentence: Suddenly, they saw a bear approaching.
Explanation: The simple sentence contains a single main clause with one verb phrase ("saw a bear approaching"); removing the relative clause makes it one independent clause.

(d) Complex sentence: When the bear appeared, the first friend climbed up a tree.
Explanation: This is complex because it joins a subordinate time clause ("When the bear appeared") to the main clause, so there is a dependent clause plus an independent clause.

(e) Affirmative sentence: The latter failed to climb up the tree.
Explanation: This affirmative form conveys the same idea without using "not" by using a positive verb ("failed") to express inability.

(f) Passive voice: No way was found by him.
Explanation: In passive voice the object ("no way") becomes the subject and the verb uses a form of "to be" + past participle ("was found"), with the agent optionally added ("by him").

(g) Simple sentence: He lay on the ground, feigning death.
Explanation: Using the participle phrase "feigning death" attaches information to the main clause without adding another clause, so the sentence remains one simple clause.

(h) Passive voice: His ears, nose, and face were smelled by the bear.
Explanation: The object(s) ("his ears, nose, and face") become the subject of the passive clause, followed by "were" + past participle ("smelled"), and the agent is introduced with "by the bear."

(i) Complex sentence: Because he lay motionless, people thought that he was dead.
Explanation: This is complex because it contains a subordinate reason clause ("Because he lay motionless") plus the main clause; the subordinate clause explains why the main clause happened.

(j) Complex sentence: After the bear went away, he escaped.
Explanation: The time clause "After the bear went away" is a dependent clause joined to the main clause "he escaped," making the sentence complex.

Question:
(a) Mr. Rahim, one of my cousins is a good teacher. (Complex)

(b) He is older than I. (Positive degree)

(c) He wants his students to be good citizen. (Complex)

(d) He leaves no stone unturned to teach them morality. (Affirmative)

(e) He becomes very happy when the students achieve good results in public examinations. (Exclamatory)

(f) Mr. Rahim is not only punctual but also sincere. (Simple)

(g) He is the best teacher in our area. (Negative)

(h) He cannot remain sitting in the class. (Affirmative)

(i) He goes to class after taking preparation. (Compound)

(j) All the students respect him very much. (Passive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Mr. Rahim, who is a good teacher, is one of my cousins.

Or, Mr. Rahim, who is one of my cousins, is a good teacher.

or, Mr. Rahim is a good teacher who is one of my cousins.

(b) I am not as old as he.

(c) He wants that his students will/may/should be good citizens.

(d) He tries his best to teach them morality.

(e) How happy he becomes when the students achieve good results in public examinations!

(f) Besides being punctual Mr. Rahim is sincere.

(g) No other teacher in our area is so/as good as he.

(h) He is unable to remain sitting in the class.

or, Can he remain sitting in the class?.

(i) He takes preparation and goes to class.

(j) He is very much respected by all the students.

Explanation:
(a) This is a simple sentence with an appositive phrase "one of my cousins" giving extra information about the subject; there is only one finite verb ("is"), so it's simple.

(b) "Older" is the comparative degree of "old" used to compare two people, so the sentence shows a comparative degree.

(c) This is a simple sentence: one main clause ("He wants") with an object phrase ("his students to be good citizens"); the infinitive phrase does not make a separate clause.

(d) It is affirmative because it states a positive action (he tries very hard); there is no negation.

(e) This is a complex sentence: it has a main clause ("He becomes very happy") and a subordinate adverbial clause introduced by "when" ("when the students achieve good results"), so there are two parts with different roles.

(f) It is simple: one subject and one finite verb ("is"), with two linked adjectives joined by the correlative pair "not only... but also," so still a single clause.

(g) "Best" is the superlative degree of "good/good," showing the highest degree among more than two, so the sentence expresses a superlative.

(h) This is negative because it contains the negative auxiliary "cannot," indicating inability or impossibility.

(i) It is a complex sentence because the main action ("He goes to class") is followed by a subordinate time/condition phrase ("after taking preparation"), forming a main clause plus a subordinate element.

(j) The sentence is active voice: the subject ("All the students") performs the action ("respect him"); the passive form would be "He is respected by all the students."

Question:
(a) William Wordsworth is one of the best well-known poets in English literature (Positive).

(b) He was the second of his father’s five sons (Negative).

(c) He was born at Cumberland on April 4, 1770 (Complex).

(j) This book brought a huge name and fame in his life (Exclamatory).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Very few well-known poets in English literature are as/so good as William Wordsworth.

(b) Wasn't he the second of his father's five sons?

Or. He was none but the second of his father's five sons.

(c) Cumberland was the place where he was born on April 4, 1770.

Or, He was born in Cumberland when it was April 4, 1770.

Or, When it was April 4, 1770, he was born in Cumberland.

(d) His mother died at his eight years old.

Or. At his eight years old his mother died.

(e) In the same year he was sent to the Grammar School of Hawkshead and he was educated there.

(f) Wasn't he only 13 years old when his father died?

(g) The teachers had given him fundamental education at the school.

(h) The education learnt from this institution played better role in his life.

(i) A new edition of his famous book, "The Lyrical Ballads" was called for by the readers in 1800.

(j) What a name and fame this book brought in his life!

Explanation:
Explanation:

a Correctly called “Positive” because it is an affirmative (declarative) sentence stating a fact about Wordsworth without any negation or question.

b This is not a negative sentence; it is an affirmative declarative stating a fact. A negative sentence would include words like “not” or other negators.

c The sentence is not complex; it is a simple declarative with a time phrase [math]“on April 4, 1770”[/math] rather than a subordinate clause. A complex sentence needs a dependent clause with its own subject and verb.

d This is actually complex, not simple, because it begins with the subordinate clause [math]“When he was eight years old”[/math] (it has its own subject and verb) followed by the main clause “his mother died.”

e This is not compound but a simple sentence: it contains a single independent clause describing an action in that year, with no second independent clause joined by a conjunction.

f It is not interrogative; it is a declarative sentence. It is complex because the phrase [math]“when his father died”[/math] is a subordinate clause attached to the main clause.

g This sentence is passive (the action is received: “had been given to him”); the active form would be “The school had given him fundamental education.” Therefore labeling it “Active” is incorrect.

h This is complex, not simple, because it contains a relative (dependent) clause [math]“that he learnt from this institution”[/math] modifying “The education,” so there is more than one clause.

i The sentence is active: “The readers” is the subject performing the action “called for.” The passive version would be “A new edition was called for by the readers,” so labeling it “Passive” is wrong.

j This is a declarative sentence, not exclamatory; an exclamatory sentence would show strong emotion and typically use an exclamation form (e.g., “What a famous book this was!”).

(j) Everybody should know it that malnutrition causes weakness. (Use passive voice)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) It is health which is wealth.

(b) A sick moneyed man is not as/so happy as a healthy poor man.

(c) A healthy man is an asset to his family but an unhealthy man is a liability.

(d) Can't he succeed in life?

(e) So, everybody must be conscious of his health.

(f) Everybody cannot but take care of his health all the time.

(g) Regular physical exercise and a balanced diet can improve health.

(h) The poor people cannot afford to take a balanced diet.

Or. The people being poor can't afford to take a balanced diet.

(i) How concerned they are with the quantity of food!

Or. How concerned with the quantity of food they are!

(j) It should be known to everybody that weakness is caused by malnutrition.

Explanation:
(a) Since health is wealth, one should take care of it.
Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it has a main clause and a subordinate clause introduced by "since," which shows reason.

(b) A sick moneyed man is not as happy as a healthy poor man.
Explanation: The comparative "happier than" is changed to the positive-degree form "not as ... as," keeping the same meaning while using the base adjective "happy."

(c) A healthy man is an asset to his family, but an unhealthy man is a liability.
Explanation: Two independent clauses are joined by the coordinating conjunction "but," making a compound sentence.

(d) Can he succeed in life?
Explanation: Forming an interrogative with a modal verb requires inverting the subject and the auxiliary: "can" + subject + main verb.

(e) So, everybody must be conscious of his health.
Explanation: "Cannot but be" means "must be," so the affirmative form uses "must" + adjective to express the same idea.

(f) Everybody must not neglect to take care of his health all the time.
Explanation: This negative sentence uses "must not neglect to..." to express the required obligation in a negated form while preserving the original meaning.

(g) Regular physical exercise and a balanced diet can improve health.
Explanation: Convert the passive "Health can be improved by..." into active voice by making the agents the subject and the action active.

(h) Poor people cannot afford a balanced diet.
Explanation: The relative clause "who are poor" is reduced to the simple noun phrase "poor people," forming a simple sentence with one subject and one predicate.

(i) How concerned they are with the quantity of food!
Explanation: An exclamatory sentence is formed with "How" plus adjective and subject to express strong feeling.

(j) It should be known by everybody that weakness is caused by malnutrition.
Explanation: "Everybody should know" is changed to passive "It should be known by everybody," and "malnutrition causes weakness" is converted to the passive "weakness is caused by malnutrition."

(h) Again he believed that only the West would be more receptive to his creative genius.

(i) Wasn't he an ardent follower of Lord Byron?

(j) Going to Europe, he started composing poems.

Explanation:
(a) What a popular poet Madhusudan Dutt was!  
This is exclamatory: "What" + noun phrase + subject + verb expresses strong feeling.

(b) He was a great dramatist in Bangla literature.  
Positive degree uses the base adjective "great" instead of the superlative/comparative phrase "one of the greatest."

(c) He was born at Sagordari, which lies on the bank of the Kapotaksho.  
This is a complex sentence because it has an independent clause ("He was born at Sagordari") plus a dependent relative clause ("which lies on the bank of the Kapotaksho") that adds extra information.

(d) As a boy he desired to be an Englishman.  
A simple sentence with one independent clause stating the subject, time phrase, and action.

(e) His teachers recognised him as a precious child.  
Active voice: the doer ("his teachers") is the subject and performs the verb "recognised" on the object "him."

(f) Did he think that he was born on the wrong side of the planet?  
Formed as an interrogative by using the auxiliary "did" for past tense and placing it before the subject.

(g) He also thought that his society did not appreciate his intellect.  
Negative sentence: "did not" negates the verb "appreciate," conveying the same idea as "was unable to appreciate."

(h) Again he believed that only the West would be more receptive to his creative genius.  
Affirmative form replaces the negative phrase "none but" with the positive word "only."

(i) Was he an ardent follower of Lord Byron?  
Interrogative formed by inverting the auxiliary "was" and the subject "he."

(j) He went to Europe and began composing poems.  
A simple sentence with one subject doing two actions (compound predicate) within a single independent clause.

Question:
(a) The students studying regularly can expect a good result.(Make it a complex sentence)

(b) But most of our students are inattentive to their studies.(Make it a negative sentence without changing the meaning)

(c) They waste their valuable time idly.(Use passive voice)

(d) Wasting time is harmful for them.(Make it an interrogative sentence)

(e) By repeating this activity they make a poor result.(Make it a complex sentence)

(f) Who loves them then?(Make it a assertive sentence without changing the original meaning)

(g) They are treated badly even by their family members.(Use active voice)

(h) If a student fails in the examination, he suffers from inferiority complex.(Make simple sentence)

(i) No other student in the class is as bad as a failed student.(Use superlative)

(j) So a student should be aware of studying regularly and attentively so that he can do well in the examination.(Make it a simple sentence)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) The students who study regularly can expect a good result.

(b) But most of our students are not attentive to their studies.

(c) Their valuable time is wasted idly by them.

(d) Isn't wasting time harmful to them?

(e) When as they repeat this activity, they make a poor result.

Or. If they repeat this activity, they will make a poor result.

(f) Everybody hates them then.

Or, Nobody loves them then.

(g) Even their family members treat them badly.

(h) By failing in the examination, a student suffers from inferiority complex.

(i) A failed student is the worst in the class.

(j) So a student should be aware of studying regularly and attentively, to do well in the examination.

Explanation:
(a) "If students study regularly, they can expect a good result."  
Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it has a subordinate clause ("If students study regularly") that conditionally supports the main clause ("they can expect a good result"), showing cause and result.

(b) "Most of our students are not attentive to their studies."  
Explanation: Changing "inattentive" to "not attentive" keeps the original negative meaning while using an explicit negative form.

(c) "Their valuable time is wasted idly by them."  
Explanation: The verb phrase is made passive ("is wasted"), moving the focus from the doer to the object ("their valuable time"); the agent "by them" shows who causes it.

(d) "Is wasting time harmful for them?"  
Explanation: To form the question, the auxiliary "is" is placed before the subject phrase "wasting time," turning the statement into an interrogative.

(e) "If they repeat this activity, they will make poor results."  
Explanation: This is a complex sentence: the conditional subordinate clause ("If they repeat this activity") leads to the main clause expressing the consequence ("they will make poor results"), showing cause and effect. (You can also say "they will get poor results" for more natural wording.)

(f) "No one loves them then."  
Explanation: The interrogative "Who loves them then?" implies a negative answer; converting it to an assertive sentence uses "No one" to state that directly while preserving meaning.

(g) "Even their family members treat them badly."  
Explanation: Active voice makes the agent ("their family members") the subject performing the action ("treat them badly"), which reverses the original passive structure.

(h) "A failed student suffers from an inferiority complex."  
Explanation: This simple sentence condenses the conditional idea into a single statement by using "failed" as an adjective describing the student.

(i) "A failed student is the worst in the class."  
Explanation: The comparative idea ("No other student ... is as bad") is changed to a superlative form ("the worst") to show that the failed student ranks lowest among all students.

(j) "A student should study regularly and attentively to do well in the examination."  
Explanation: The complex original is simplified by combining purpose into an infinitive phrase ("to do well"), making one clear simple sentence that states duty and result.

Question:
(a) Haji Mohammad Muhsin was not an unkind man at all. (Affirmative)

(b) He inherited vast proerty from his father and sister. (Interrogative)

(c) He was unmarried. (Negative)

(d) During his lifetime, he spent money lavishly to help the poor. (Complex)

(e) One night when he was saying his prayer, a thief broke into his room. (Simple)

(f) Seeing Muhsin the thief cried. (compound)

(g) The thief was caught. (Active)

(h) How needy the thief was! (Assertive)

(i) He gave the thief some food and money. (Passive)

(j) Muhsin was one of the best philanthropists in the world. (Positive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Haji Mohammad Muhsin was a very kind man.

(b) Didn't he inherit vast property from his father and sister?

(c) He was not married/He did not marry.

(d) When he was alive, he spent money lavishly to help the poor.

Or. It was his lifetime when he spent money lavishly to help the poor room.

(e) One night at the time of saying his prayer, a thief broke into his room.

Or. One night while praying a thief broke into his room.

Or. One night during the time of saying his prayer, a thief broke into his room.

(f) The thief saw Muhsin and cried.

(g) Muhsin/He caught the thief.

(h) The thief was very needy.

(i) Some food and money were given to the thief by him.

Or, The thief was given some food and money by him.

(j) Very few philanthropists in the world were so/as good as Muhsin.

Explanation:
(a) The sentence uses litotes (“not unkind”) but conveys a positive meaning; the clear affirmative form is “Haji Mohammad Muhsin was a kind man.” Affirmative sentences state something positively rather than denying it.

(b) To make it interrogative use the auxiliary + subject + base verb pattern: “Did he inherit vast property from his father and sister?” Interrogative sentences are formed by inversion and end with a question mark.

(c) “He was unmarried” is negative because the prefix “un-” shows negation (not married); you can also write it as “He was not married.” Negative sentences express non-existence or denial.

(d) It’s complex because it has a main clause “he spent money lavishly” plus a subordinate purpose clause “to help the poor” (and a temporal phrase “During his lifetime”). A complex sentence contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause or phrase.

(e) A simple sentence has one independent clause expressing a single idea; the simple version is “One night a thief broke into his room.” It contains one main verb and one complete thought.

(f) A compound sentence joins two independent clauses of equal weight; e.g. “Muhsin saw the thief, and the thief cried.” Use a coordinating conjunction or semicolon to link the clauses.

(g) Active voice places the doer before the verb; the active form is “Someone caught the thief.” Convert passive to active by making the agent the subject and using the main verb in the appropriate tense.

(h) An assertive (declarative) sentence states a fact; the assertive form is “The thief was very needy.” It simply declares the thief’s condition without exclamation.

(i) Passive voice makes the object the subject: “Some food and money were given to the thief by him.” Form the passive with the correct form of “be” + past participle, and optionally include the agent with “by.”

(j) The sentence praises Muhsin, so it is positive in tone: it affirms a good quality (“one of the best philanthropists in the world”). Positive sentences state affirming information rather than negation.

(c) Flowers are used on different occasions.(Active)

(d) We present flower to our nearest and dearest person.(Passive)

(e) We need flowers to decorate a place.(Complex)

(f) The rose is the best of all flowers.(Positive)

(g) Having sweet scent and beauty we love it very much.(Compound)

(h) It is lovelier than all other flowers.(Superlative)

(i) The rose is a very nice flower.(Exclamatory)

(j) As the demand for flowers is increasing day by day we should cultivate flower on commercial basis.(Simple)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Isn't a flower a glowing gift of nature?

(b) It is the symbol of love and beauty.

(c) People/We use flowers on different occasions.

(d) Flower is presented to our nearest and dearest persons by us.

(e) We need flowers so that we can decorate a place..

(f) No other flower is as/so good as the rose.

(g) It has sweet scent and beauty and so we love it very much.

(h) It is the loveliest of all flowers.

or, It is the loveliest flower.

(i) What a nice flower the rose is!

(j) Because of the increasing demand for flowers day by day, we should cultivate flower on commercial basis.

Explanation:
(a) To make it interrogative you invert the auxiliary and subject; since the verb is [math]is[/math], ask: "Is a flower a glowing gift of nature?" This makes it a question.

(b) Change the negative question to a positive statement by removing the negative contraction and the question mark: "It is the symbol of love and beauty." This makes it affirmative.

(c) The sentence is passive ("are used"); to make it active, put the doer as the subject and change the verb: "People use flowers on different occasions." Passive agent becomes the subject in active voice.

(d) To form the passive from the active, make the object the subject and use the appropriate form of "to be" + past participle: "Flowers are presented to our nearest and dearest person (by us)." This shows passive construction.

(e) To make it complex, add a subordinate clause (reason/purpose) with a subordinating conjunction: "Because we want to decorate a place, we need flowers." A complex sentence has an independent clause plus a dependent clause.

(f) "The rose is the best of all flowers" is superlative; the positive degree removes comparison: "The rose is good" or "The rose is a beautiful flower." Positive degree uses the base adjective without comparative/superlative markers.

(g) Turn the participial phrase into a separate independent clause and join with a coordinating conjunction to make a compound sentence: "The flower has a sweet scent and beauty, and we love it very much." A compound sentence connects two independent clauses.

(h) Change the comparative phrase into the superlative by using "the" + superlative form: "It is the loveliest of all flowers." Superlative shows the highest degree among all.

(i) Use an exclamatory structure with "What" or "How": "What a very nice flower the rose is!" This expresses strong feeling, so it becomes exclamatory.

(j) To make it simple, keep a single independent clause and remove the subordinating element: "We should cultivate flowers on a commercial basis." A simple sentence has only one independent clause.

(h) It is called the pleasure seekers’ paradise. (Active)

(i) Every year a lot of people come to visit it. (Compound)

(j) If I could visit the sea-beach! (active)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) My friend invited me that/ in order that/ so that I could/might pay a visit to Cox's Bazar.

Or, It is my friend who invited me to pay a visit to Cox's Bazar.

Or, Cox's Bazar is the place where my friend invited me to visit.

(b) I was not (very) displeased/unhappy/sad at all.

Or, I could not but become glad.

(c) The invitation was accepted by me.

(d) My friend received me cordially at the time of my reaching there.

Or, After/On reaching/Reaching there, my friend received me cordially.

(e) How excited I was to see the seabeach!

(f) It is larger than any other sea-beach (all other sea-beaches) in the world.

(g) Very few seabeaches in the world are so/as beautiful as it.

(h) We/People call it the pleasure seekers paradise.

(i) Every year a lot of people come here and (they) visit it.

(j) I wish I could visit the seabeach.

Or, Would that I could visit the seabeach.

Explanation:
(a) To make it a complex sentence you need a main clause plus a subordinate clause; for example, add a reason or time: "My friend invited me to pay a visit to Cox’s Bazar because he wanted to show me around." A complex sentence has one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.

(b) Make it negative by placing "not" after the auxiliary verb: "I was not very glad." Negation is formed by adding "not" (or a contraction) to the verb phrase.

(c) Passive: turn the object into the subject and use the appropriate form of "be" + past participle: "The invitation was accepted by me." In passive voice the original object becomes the subject and the doer is optional after "by."

(d) To make it a simple sentence remove the subordinate clause and keep a single independent clause: "My friend received me cordially." A simple sentence has one independent clause only.

(e) Exclamatory: express strong feeling with "How" or an exclamation mark: "How excited I was to see the sea-beach!" Exclamatory sentences show strong emotion and often begin with "What/How" or end with an exclamation mark.

(f) Comparative: compare two things using "more/er ... than": e.g., "It is larger than any other sea-beach nearby." Comparative degree uses "more" or "-er" plus "than" to show comparison between two items.

(g) Positive: use the base adjective without comparison or superlative: "It is beautiful." The positive degree simply states the quality without comparing it to others.

(h) Active: make the agent the subject and use an active verb: "People call it the pleasure seekers’ paradise." In active voice the subject performs the action directly.

(i) Compound: join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction: "Every year a lot of people come to visit it, and they enjoy the beach." A compound sentence has two (or more) independent clauses joined by and, but, or, etc.

(j) Active: the sentence is already active because the subject "I" is the doer of "visit" (expressing a wish): "If I could visit the sea-beach!" Active voice has the subject performing the action.

Explanation:
ক বাক্যটি ইতিবাচক (affirmative), কারণ এতে কোনো নেতিবাচক পদ নেই এবং বক্তব্য সরাসরি একটি সত্য স্থাপনা করেছে: টেলিভিশন আধুনিক বিজ্ঞানের একটি বিস্ময়কর আবিষ্কার।  

খ এটি নেতিবাচক ও বহুবচনীয় (passive) ধাঁচের বাক্য: "not" থাকার কারণে নেতিবাচক এবং কৃত্যটি বিষয় (it) কর্তৃক গ্রহণ করা হয়েছে, তাই passive voice।  

গ এখানে একক বিষয় ("Scientists") ও দুটো ক্রিয়া ("spent" এবং "worked") যুক্ত আছে, তাই এটি একটি simple sentence‑এর মতো একক স্বাধীন বাক্য যার compound predicate আছে।  

ঘ বাক্যটি ইতিবাচক (affirmative), কারণ এতে কোনো না-উপস্থিতি বা প্রশ্ন নেই — এটি সরাসরি জানাচ্ছে যে প্রায় প্রত্যেক পরিবারের টেলিভিশন আছে।  

ঙ এটি সাধারণ বিবৃতিমূলক (declarative) বাক্য, কারণ এটি কোনো প্রশ্ন করে না বা না-প্রকাশ করে; এটি কেবল একটি তথ্য দিচ্ছে যে সকল বয়সীদের মানুষদের টিভি দেখা ভালো লাগে।  

চ বাক্যটি সাধারণ সরল বাক্য যেখানে "telecast by television" একটি participle phrase হিসেবে "programmes" কে বর্ণনা করছে; বাক্যটির কাঠামো একটাই স্বাধীন ধারা, তাই এটি simple declarative।  

ছ বাক্যটি active voice—"Television" বিষয় হিসেবে কাজ করে এবং সরাসরি কর্মটি করছে ("should telecast"), তাই এটি passive নয় (passive হলে হবে: "Educative programmes should be telecast by television")।  

জ এটি একটি complex sentence কারণ এতে একটি শর্তসাপেক্ষ subordinate clause ("If you watch television") এবং একটি স্বাধীন মূল clause ("you can learn many things") আছে; শর্তাধীন clause একা দাঁড়াতে পারে না।  

ঝ বাক্যটি একটি সরল স্বাধীন বাক্য, একমাত্র স্বাধীন ধারা আছে যা বলছে মানুষ তাদের অবসর কিভাবে কাটায়; তাই এটি simple sentence।  

ঞ এটি তুলনামূলক (comparative) আকারে বক্তব্য করছে ("so useful as"), কারণ এটি টেলিভিশনকে অন্য কিছুর সঙ্গে তুলনা করছে; যদি superlative হতো তাহলে "the most useful" জাতীয় শব্দ ব্যবহার হতো।

Question:
(a) Bangladesh is a low-lying country. (Make interrogative)

(b) Every year natural disasters visiť us. (Make passive voice)

(c) Flood is one of the most dangerous natural disasters. (Use comparative degree)

(d) It is Dhaka city which has not yet suffered any severe earthquake. (Make simple sentence)

(e) The people living in the high land can escape flood. (Make complex sentence)

(f) Crops are damaged by this flood. (Make active voice)

(g) Who does not know the consequence of 'Tsunami'? (Make assertive sentence)

(h) The recent flood was very devastating. (Make exclamatory sentence)

(i) Bangladesh is in the active earthquake zone. (Make negative)

(j) Dhaka is the most risky city in the earthquake zone. (Use positive degree)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Isn't Bangladesh a low-lying country?

(b) We are visited by natural disasters every year.

(c) Flood is more dangerous than most other natural disasters.

(d) Dhaka city has not yet suffered any severe earthquake.

(e) The people who live in the high land, can escape flood.

Or. It is the people who live in the high land can escape flood.

Or. There are people who tive in the high land can escape flood.

(f) This flood damages crops.

(g) Everybody knows the consequences of Tsunami.

(h) How devastating the recent flood was!

(i) Bangladesh is not in the inactive earthquake zone.

(j) No other city in the earthquake zone is so/as risky as Dhaka.

Explanation:
(a) Is Bangladesh a low-lying country?
This is a yes/no question formed by inverting the subject and the auxiliary verb "is" because the original sentence has no auxiliary.

(b) We are visited by natural disasters every year.
In passive voice the object ("us") becomes the subject ("we"), the original subject becomes the agent introduced by "by," and the tense (simple present) is kept with "are visited."

(c) Floods are more dangerous than many other natural disasters.
To make a comparative, use "more + adjective + than" to compare floods with other natural disasters; here "more dangerous than" replaces the superlative phrase.

(d) Dhaka city has not yet suffered any severe earthquake.
Remove the cleft structure "It is ... which" and put the real subject "Dhaka city" before the verb to make a simple sentence.

(e) The people who live on the high land can escape floods.
A complex sentence is formed by adding a subordinate relative clause "who live on the high land" describing "the people."

(f) This flood damages crops.
Convert to active voice by making the agent "this flood" the subject and changing the verb to the active form "damages."

(g) Everyone knows the consequences of a tsunami.
Change the interrogative into a declarative (assertive) sentence; "everyone knows" states the idea positively.

(h) What a devastating flood the recent one was!
Use an exclamatory structure with "What" + noun phrase (or "How" + adjective) and invert the subject and verb to show strong feeling.

(i) Bangladesh is not in the active earthquake zone.
Form the negative by inserting "not" after the auxiliary verb "is."

(j) Dhaka is a risky city in the earthquake zone.
Use the positive (base) form of the adjective "risky" instead of the superlative "most risky" to state the quality without comparison.

(j) A corrupted man leads a very unhappy life. (Exclamatory)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Very few evils are so bad as corruption.

(b) A corrupt man can do anything which is against morality.

Or. A man, who is corrupt, can do anything against morality.

(c) A corrupt man is hated by people.

(d) Does anybody respect him?

Or. Who respects him?

(e) The man taking bribe is next to devil.

(f) We have strict law, but we are affected by this evil.

(g) A corrupt man is the most hated person.

(h) We hope Bangladesh to be free from this evil.

(i) There is nobody but avoids a corrupt man.

Or. Nobody mixes with a corrupt man.

Or. There is nobody who does not avoid a corrupt man.

(j) What an unhappy life a corrupt man leads!

Explanation:
a This is a positive (affirmative) sentence because it states a fact/opinion directly without any negation or question; it affirms that corruption is among the worst evils.

b It is called complex because the main idea ("A corrupted man can do anything") is expanded by an additional clause/phrase ("against morality") that describes manner and tightens the meaning; a complex sentence mixes a main clause with subordinate information to give fuller detail.

c The label “passive” applies when the object becomes the subject, e.g. the passive form is "A corrupted man is hated by people"; passive voice is formed with an appropriate form of "be" + past participle to show the action is received.

d An interrogative asks a question; to make this sentence interrogative we invert the auxiliary: "Does nobody respect him?" or more naturally "Does anyone respect him?"; the sentence form changes to request information rather than state a fact.

e It’s treated as simple here because it expresses one main idea with a single finite verb ("is"); though it contains a relative phrase ("who takes bribe") that describes the subject, the sentence conveys one complete thought centered on "is next to devil."

f It’s labeled compound because it shows two contrasted clauses joined by a conjunction and expressing related ideas: one clause states a condition ("Though we have strict law") and the other states the result/contrast ("we are still affected by this evil"); such coordination or linking of clauses yields a compound/complex sense that contrasts two equal points.

g This is marked superlative because it expresses the highest degree of hatred by comparing everyone else to the corrupted man ("No other person is as hated as a corrupted man"), effectively singling him out as most hated.

h It’s classed simple because it conveys a single straightforward thought ("We hope") with a clear object clause; the sentence is a single declarative statement expressing a hope about Bangladesh’s future.

i It’s considered negative in sense because it indicates refusal of association—people do not associate with him ("everybody avoids him"), so the sentence expresses a negative social response even though grammatically it uses an affirmative verb.

j The exclamatory label applies when the idea is expressed with strong feeling, e.g. as an exclamation: "What an unhappy life a corrupted man leads!"—such a form uses exclamatory structure or punctuation to show strong emotion.

Explanation:
Explanation:

a A long time ago there lived a young man called Ruplal, and he led a simple life.  
This is a compound sentence because it joins two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction "and."

b Did he live with his family and work on a farm?  
This is a yes/no interrogative formed by using the auxiliary "did" and the base form of the verbs.

c Although it was a beautiful place, there were a lot of problems.  
This is a complex sentence because "Although..." introduces a subordinate clause that contrasts with the main clause, so one clause depends on the other.

d The village people were not quarrelsome.  
The negative is formed by inserting "not" after the auxiliary verb "were."

e Ruplal decided to go and live alone in the jungle so that he could find peace.  
This is complex because "so that..." introduces a dependent clause of purpose, explaining why he decided to go.

f Collecting his things, he went to live by himself.  
This is a simple sentence with a single main clause; the participial phrase "Collecting his things" modifies the subject but does not create a second clause.

g A nice little hut was made by Ruplal in the jungle.  
This is the passive voice: the object of the active sentence becomes the subject, and the verb becomes the appropriate form of "to be" + past participle.

h I am very happy now.  
This assertive (declarative) sentence states the speaker’s feeling as a fact rather than exclaiming it.

i My jungle hut is peaceful.  
This uses the positive degree of the adjective "peaceful" (the base form) instead of the superlative "one of the most peaceful."

j That night he heard a noise.  
This is a simple sentence because it has a single main clause expressing one complete idea.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Everybody wants to succeed in life.

(b) Is it known to you?

(c) A man who is industrious will shine in life.

(d) We need hard work for success.

(e) A life without an assignment is not an actual life.

(f) No one can receive any reward without working hard.

(g) Can one be successful without it?

(h) How happy a successful man is!

(i) A successful man is the happiest man.

(j) An idle man is not so healthy as a hard-working man.

Explanation:
(a) Assertive: "Everyone wants to succeed in life."  
Reason: An interrogative asking if anybody does not want success is best turned into a universal affirmative by stating the general truth — "everyone" — as the assertive form.

(b) Passive: "Is it known to you?"  
Reason: To make passive, the object "it" becomes the subject and the verb changes to passive form "is known," with "to you" indicating the agent/recipient.

(c) Complex: "If a man is industrious, he will shine in life."  
Reason: A complex sentence has a main clause plus a subordinate clause; using an "if" conditional links cause (being industrious) to result (shining in life), forming a complex sentence.

(d) Active: "One must work hard to succeed."  
Reason: Change the impersonal passive "is needed" into an active verb with an explicit subject ("one") so the doer performs the action in the active voice.

(e) Negative: "A life without an assignment is not an actual life."  
Reason: Negation is formed by replacing "with" by "without" and adding "not" to deny the original affirmative statement.

(f) Simple: "Hard work is necessary for any reward."  
Reason: A simple sentence states the idea directly without subordinate clauses; replacing "No one can receive… unless…" by a single-clause statement expresses the same necessity simply.

(g) Interrogative: "Can one be successful without it?"  
Reason: To form a question, invert the modal auxiliary "can" and the subject "one" so the sentence becomes interrogative.

(h) Exclamatory: "How happy a successful man is!"  
Reason: Exclamatory sentences use "how" (or "what") plus an adjective/noun to express strong feeling, turning a plain statement into an exclamation.

(i) Superlative: "A successful man is the happiest of all."  
Reason: The superlative uses "the" + adjective + "-est" (or "most") to show the highest degree; "of all" emphasizes comparison with everyone else.

(j) Positive: "A hardworking man is healthy; an idle man is not."  
Reason: The positive degree states qualities without comparison by using the base adjective ("healthy") and, if contrast is needed, the opposite form for the other subject.
