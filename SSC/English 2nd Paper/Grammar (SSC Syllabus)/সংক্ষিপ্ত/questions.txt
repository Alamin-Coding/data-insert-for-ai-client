Question:
why are you going to barishal said father i want to buy some important books said saad do you need money yes father dont go alone as time is not going well.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct version uses quotation marks with question marks for questions, a comma before the dialogue tag when the quote continues with “said…”, capitalization for sentence starts and proper nouns like [math]Barishal[/math] and forms of address (e.g., Father), and an apostrophe in contractions like “Don’t.” These rules make who speaks and the sentence type clear, for example: “Why are you going to Barishal?” said Father. “I want to buy some important books,” said Saad. “Do you need money?” “Yes, Father. Don’t go alone, as times are not going well.”

Question:
will you please tell me one reason of air pollution yes the smoke from our household activities vehicles factories etc is mainly causing air pollution

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Yes — smoke from household activities, vehicles, and factories is a major cause of air pollution because burning fuels releases harmful gases (like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide) and tiny particles (particulate matter) into the air. These pollutants build up, lower air quality, and harm human health, plants, and the environment.

Question:
my dear mother your letter is just to hand it seems to me that you are anxious for me but you need not think about me

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
You should write it as two sentences with a comma for direct address: "My dear mother, your letter is just to hand." Here "to hand" means "has just arrived." Then: "It seems to me that you are anxious for me, but you need not think about me." The comma before "but" links two independent clauses, and the sentence reassures the mother not to worry.

Question:
is there anybody here who has ever crossed a river by boat i have teacher i clearly remember what happened in that journey said jamal

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Correct reported speech: Jamal told the teacher that he had crossed a river by boat and that he clearly remembered what had happened on that journey. Reason: converting a question and present perfect into indirect speech requires changing the question into a statement, backshifting the tense ([has crossed] → [had crossed]), changing deictic words (this → that), and using "told the teacher" to show the indirect report.

Question:
how is your father bilkis said mr rahman he is very well thank you bilkis replied i am glad to hear that he is in good health said mr rahman

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct version uses quotation marks to separate each speaker’s words, capitalizes the first word of each quoted sentence, and places the appropriate comma or question mark before the reporting clause so we know who is speaking. Correct form: Mr. Rahman said, "How is your father, Bilkis?" Bilkis replied, "He is very well." "Thank you," Bilkis added. "I am glad to hear that he is in good health," said Mr. Rahman.

Question:
do not worry about a few mistakes said the teacher you can learn a lot through your mistakes do we learn from our mistakes asked the boy

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct punctuation puts each speaker’s exact words in quotation marks with the right end punctuation: "Do not worry about a few mistakes," said the teacher; "You can learn a lot through your mistakes." and "Do we learn from our mistakes?" asked the boy. This follows direct-speech rules: capitalize the first word inside quotes, keep commas/periods/question marks inside the quotation marks, and place the reporting clause (said/asked the teacher/boy) after the quoted sentence.

Question:
have you heard the name of alexander asked mr ahmed no sir razu replied how strange it is said he will you tell me about alexander please well he was the great king of macedonia

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The corrected version capitalizes proper nouns (Alexander, Mr. Ahmed, Razu, Macedonia) and the first word of each spoken sentence, and uses quotation marks to show direct speech with question marks or exclamation marks placed inside the quotes when the speaker asks or exclaims. Also, when a reporting verb follows the quoted words, use a comma before the closing quotation mark (e.g., "No, sir," Razu replied) rather than a period.

Question:
go to bed now mother said you can complete your assignment in the morning no mom ill finish it now

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct formatting puts each speaker’s words inside quotation marks and uses commas or periods as needed: “Go to bed now,” Mother said. “You can complete your assignment in the morning.” “No, Mom. I’ll finish it now.”  
This is right because quotation marks show spoken words, a comma separates the speech from the reporting clause, and capitalization and a comma after the vocative “Mom” follow standard punctuation rules.

Question:
dont you have any relative here to stay with no sir so i need a transfer certificate to be admitted there

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The answer is correct because if the student has no relative to stay with locally, the new school will require an official Transfer Certificate from the current school to complete admission. A Transfer Certificate is a formal document that proves a student has left their previous school and provides academic and conduct details needed by the admitting school.

Question:
why are you late always try to attend the class regularly yes sir the student said to the teacher

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Correct reported form: The teacher asked the student why he was always late and told him to attend class regularly; the student replied, “Yes, sir.” This is because in reported speech the present tense shifts to past (are → was), questions become “asked why …”, imperatives are reported as “told/asked + to‑infinitive,” and a short affirmative reply is reported as an agreement.

zaman can you tell me what i am teaching the teacher asked im sorry sir i can’t follow replied zaman you can’t because you are not attentive the teacher said

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The teacher’s remark is correct because Zaman said he couldn’t follow, and the teacher gave the reason—Zaman was not attentive—so the refusal and cause match. In reported speech the meaning stays the same but pronouns and tenses shift (e.g., “I can’t” → “he couldn’t”) to fit the reporting context.

Question:
(a) It matters little to me whether —.

(b) He pretended as if —.

(c) If I had the wings of a bird, —.

(d) Take your umbrella lest —.

(e) Hardly had he started for school —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) It matters little to me whether he comes or not.  
Explanation: Here "whether...or not" introduces a noun clause that functions as the object of "matters little," showing both alternatives are unimportant.

(b) He pretended as if he were ill.  
Explanation: "As if" shows a false appearance; the subjunctive "were" (or past form) is used because the situation is not real.

(c) If I had the wings of a bird, I would fly.  
Explanation: This is a hypothetical (second conditional): the past form "had" in the if-clause plus "would" in the main clause expresses an unreal present possibility.

(d) Take your umbrella lest you get wet.  
Explanation: "Lest" expresses negative purpose ("so that... not") and is followed by a verb (modern usage: "lest you get wet" or more formally "lest you should get wet").

(e) Hardly had he started for school when it began to rain.  
Explanation: Sentences with "hardly" use inversion (auxiliary before subject) and are usually followed by "when/before" to show that one event happened immediately after another.

Question:
(a) But for your timely intervention –

(b) Many days passed —.

(c) A child — is afraid of fire.

(d) Work hard provided that —.

(e) Blessing is not valued —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
ক "But for" মানে "যদি না থাকতেন/হত", তাই বাক্যটি সম্পূর্ণ করতে হবে এমন একটি ফলাফল-ধর্মী শর্তীয় ক্লজ দিয়ে, যেমন: "But for your timely intervention, I would have been ruined." এখানে মূল কাঠামো হলো "But for + noun, (would/could/might) + have + past participle"।  

খ "Many days passed —." এর শেষে সাধারণত সময়গত অনুক্রম বোঝাতে "before" আসে, যেমন: "Many days passed before he returned." অর্থাৎ কোন ঘটনা ঘটার আগ পর্যন্ত অনেক দিন কেটে যায়—এজন্য "before + clause" ব্যবহার হয়।  

গ মানুষের জন্য আপেক্ষিক সর্বনাম "who" ব্যবহার হয়, তাই সঠিক পূরণ হবে "A child who is afraid of fire." এখানে "who" শিশুকে নির্দেশ করে এবং বাক্যটিকে সম্পূর্ণ করে।  

ঘ "provided that" মানে "শর্তসাপেক্ষে/যদি", তাই এর পরে শর্তসূচক একটি বাক্য থাকতে হবে, যেমন: "Work hard provided that you want to succeed." অর্থাৎ "যদি তুমি সফল হতে চাও"—এই শর্ত পূরণ হলে পরামর্শ কার্যকর।  

ঙ প্রচলিত প্রবচন অনুযায়ী "Blessing is not valued until it is lost." এখানে "until" সময় বা অবস্থা পর্যন্ত মূল্য না বোঝার ধারণা প্রকাশ করে—অর্থাৎ হারানোর পরে তা মূল্যায়িত হয়।

(a) Unless you study attentively —.

(b) It is a long time since —.

(c) If I had seen you, —.

(d) 1971 is the year when —.

(e) Danger comes where —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Unless you study attentively, you will fail the exam.  
Explanation: "Unless" means "if not", so the sentence is a negative conditional: a future result (will fail) follows the negative condition (not studying attentively).

(b) It is a long time since I last saw you.  
Explanation: "Since" links to a past event; this construction (“It is a long time since …”) refers to a past point and implies the present perfect idea (I have not seen you for a long time).

(c) If I had seen you, I would have spoken to you.  
Explanation: This is the third (past unreal) conditional: past perfect in the if-clause + "would have" + past participle in the main clause to show an unreal past result.

(d) 1971 is the year when Bangladesh became independent.  
Explanation: "The year when" introduces a time-defining relative clause; a past simple verb is used for a historical fact.

(e) Danger comes where there is carelessness.  
Explanation: "Where" here means "in situations in which"; the present simple states a general truth about cause and effect.

Question:
(a) He asked me whether —.

(b) Had I the wings of a dove —.

(c) He could help you provided that —.

(d) Hardly had the bell rung —.

(e) We must look before we leap lest —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) He asked me whether I had seen it.  
Explanation: "Whether" introduces a yes/no reported question and takes the normal clause order (subject + verb), not the inversion used in direct questions.

(b) Had I the wings of a dove, I would fly to you.  
Explanation: This is an inverted conditional (formal equivalent of "If I had..."); inversion of "If I had" is used to form unreal present conditions and the main clause uses "would."

(c) He could help you provided that you asked him.  
Explanation: "Provided that" = "if," so it introduces a condition with normal word order (subject + verb) in the subordinate clause.

(d) Hardly had the bell rung when the students left.  
Explanation: After negative/time adverbials like "hardly" we use inversion (auxiliary before subject) and join the result with "when" to mean "as soon as."

(e) We must look before we leap lest we should fall. (or "lest we fall.")  
Explanation: "Lest" expresses prevention ("in order that... not") and is followed by a subjunctive form (often with "should") or the bare present to show the negative purpose.

(c) A graveyard is the place —.

(d) — cannot be blotted.

(e) The answer that he —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) There are many stars in the sky which twinkle. Explanation: The relative clause "which twinkle" describes the stars; we use "which/that" to add information about things.

(b) Rakib will swim after he finishes his homework. Explanation: "After" is followed by a clause; for future sequences English uses the present simple in the subordinate clause ("he finishes") to show the action happens first.

(c) A graveyard is the place where dead people are buried. Explanation: "Where" introduces a location clause that defines what the place is used for.

(d) What is written cannot be blotted. Explanation: "What" forms a noun clause meaning "the things that are written," and that whole clause is the subject of the sentence.

(e) The answer that he gave was correct. Explanation: "That he gave" is a defining relative clause modifying "answer," and the past tense "gave" matches the time of the action.

ক অ্যাসিড বৃষ্টি ক্ষতিকর কারণ এতে বাতাসে থাকা সালফার ও নাইট্রোজেন অক্সাইড থেকে তৈরি অ্যাসিড দ্রবীভূত থাকে, যা গাছপালা, স্থাপনা ও জলজ জীবদের ক্ষতি করে। এই ক্ষতি কেন হয়—অ্যাসিড পিএইচ কমিয়ে বিষাক্ত পরিবেশ তৈরি করে।

খ বাক্যটি পূরণ: “বাতাস এত শক্তিশালী ছিল যে আমরা ঠিকভাবে হাঁটতে পারিনি।” এখানে “so… that” কাঠামোটি কারণ ও ফলাফল দেখায়: শক্ত বাতাস (কারণ) → হাঁটা কঠিন হওয়া (ফল)।

গ বাক্যটি পূরণ: “সে একটু সতর্ক হলে ওই ভুলটি করত না।” “Had he been…” inversion হলো পুরোনো শর্তবাচক বাক্যের সরল রূপ, অর্থাৎ “If he had been a little careful…” এর সমতুল্য এবং অনুশোচনাপূর্ণ অতীত শর্ত প্রকাশ করে।

ঘ বাক্যটি পূরণ: “তারা ভয় পেয়েছিল যখন তারা হঠাৎ করে সাপটা দেখতে পেল।” এখানে “were frightened when…” ফলে (ভয় পাওয়া) ঘটেছে একটি নির্দিষ্ট ঘটনার (সাপ দেখা) কারণে; অতীত কালে দুইটি ঘটনা সম্পর্ক প্রকাশ পায়।

ঙ বাক্যটি পূরণ: “ছাতা নিয়ে নাও, lest it should rain.” (“ছাতা নিয়ে নাও যাতে হঠাৎ বৃষ্টি হলে তুমি ভিজে না।” ) “Lest” শব্দটি সতর্কতা বা প্রতিরোধ বোঝায় এবং সাধারণত “so that… not” বা ফর্মাল ইংরেজিতে “lest … should …” অর্থে ব্যবহৃত হয়।

খ হাওয়া এত শক্তিশালী ছিল যে ছাদ/গাছও উড়ে পড়ল — এখানে "so ... that" কাঠামোটি শক্তির মাত্রা ও তার সরাসরি ফল বোঝায়।

গ যে, Had he been a little careful, he would not have made that mistake — "Had he been..." হল If-clause-এর ইনভার্সন যা অতীতের বিপরীত ধারণা দেখায়; ফলস্বরূপ অংশে "would have" লাগে।

ঘ তারা ভয় পেয়েছিল যখন তারা সাপটি দেখল — "when" সময়গত সম্পর্ক দেখায়; দেখার কাজটি ভয়ের কারণ হিসেবে কাজ করেছে।
