Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Graffiti: The Voice of the July Revolution
Graffiti is an art form that uses public spaces like walls and streets. It shares messages, opinions, or protests in creative ways. During the July Revolution in 2024, graffiti became a powerful tool for students to express their feelings and emotions. After a student activist, Abu Sayeed, was killed in Rangpur during the quota movement, a mural appeared with the words, &quot;Who will bring justice for the murder of martyr Abu Sayeed?&quot; Although it was removed the next day, it inspired many.
Undoubtedly, graffiti became a strong way to protest during the anti-discrimination movement. It was used to fight against the dictatorial government, which ruled for over 15 years. The movement began when students demanded changes to the quota system in government jobs. As the protests grew, graffiti became a strong weapon for the students. Walls in cities were filled with colorful pictures and writings. These artworks showed anger, hope, and unity. They carried strong messages against injustice, corruption and oppression. Some famous slogans were &quot;Quota Na Medha?&quot; and &quot;Bullet Diye Biplob Thame Na.&quot; The graffiti helped to give a voice to those who were silenced by the regime.
The protests became stronger after students at Dhaka University were attacked by government forces. Graffiti was a way to show their anger and demand change. Students and others painted murals in Dhaka and other cities. These murals became symbols of resistance. It turned every wall into a canvas for their defiance. The artwork also created solidarity among various groups who were victim of social and economic division.
After falling down the govt. on 5 August 2024, graffiti spread across the country. Students painted walls to honor martyrs and support the revolution. Symbols like clenched fists and the rising sun were common. Even rickshaw pullers and artists joined in it. They donated money and effort. The once-silenced voices now echoed through the streets. The power of visual expression solidified the movements legacy.
Graffiti became the voice of the July Revolution of 2024. It reminded people of their power to fight against injustice and create change. This art continues to inspire freedom and strength in Bangladesh.

Question:
Tree Plantation/ Importance of Trees in Our Life

Or, Why More Trees Should Be Planted

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Tree Plantation/ Importance of Trees in Our Life
Or, Why More Trees Should Be Planted
Tree plantation is the process in which tree seedlings are transplanted generally for forestry. Trees are our best friend. We depend much on trees. Trees provide us with oxygen which is very essential for our existence. So to say, our life on earth largely depends upon trees. But it is a matter of great regret that we are cutting down trees very unwisely for some quick profit. It is really a matter of great concern.
First, it is important to know what trees do for us. Man needs oxygen. In every breath we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Trees leave oxygen out and take carbon dioxide in. Thus, they provide us with the most necessary thing we need on earth. Trees also give us food, clothes, shelter, medicine and shades. We cannot live without the help of trees.
But, at present, people are cutting down trees at a large scale. There are many reasons of cutting down trees. Man is cutting down them mainly for firewood and furniture. Everyday our population is increasing. So, more firewood and furniture are needed for the additional people.
Tropical rain forests are also being cleared at a high rate. It takes thousands of years to grow a tropical rain forest. Unfortunately, at present, they are being cleared at the rate of fourteen square miles per hour.
The effect of deforestation is very harmful and dangerous. For this, 'Greenhouse Effect' has occurred and the temperature of the world is increasing day by day. Heat waves have grasped many countries. Ice is melting in the South and North Poles. The level of water in the sea is increasing. This may lead to worldwide flood. Measures should immediately be taken to prevent deforestation. We should plant five trees if we cut down one. We should also try our best to stop cutting down trees and save the environment. Otherwise, our future will be very difficult and uninhabitable.

Question:
Climate Change in Bangladesh

Or, Climate Change and Its After Effects

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Climate Change in Bangladesh
Or, Climate Change and Its After Effects
Climate change is the change in earth's climatic pattern. Increase of temperature and natural disasters are the result of climate change. Due to increasing concentrations of Greenhouse Gases, our climate is expected to change even more in the coming decades. Our country is one of the most affected ones by climate change in the world.
This climate change has a huge impact on our agriculture, infrastructure and way of life. This is mainly because
of the geographical location of our country, making it highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Bangladesh has a flat, low lying landscape and lack of institutional setup. Climate change is becoming a crucial issue to us and to our government as well. More than 80% of the land is prone to flooding. About two-thirds of our population is engaged in agriculture. So climate change will affect the farmers immensely. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says, Bangladesh would experience a net increase in poverty of 15% by 2030 due to climate change. 17% people of the country will need to be relocated if global warming persists at the present rate. 81% migrants in Dhaka's slums reported a climate-related issue for displacement. It has been predicted that there will be 3 to 10 million internal migrants in Bangladesh over the next 40 years. According to the World Bank, climate change will cost Bangladesh USD 121 billion during 2005-2050, or USD 3 billion annually, unless measures are taken.
This natural disaster brings floods, cyclones, storms, extreme temperature and drought into the country. Mostly, the northern regions of Bangladesh suffer due to extreme temperature problem.
The World Bank warns Bangladesh of becoming the country worst hit by climate change by the year 2100. A WB report estimates that the sea level will rise by 3 feet. This will cause huge flooding and the failing of crops in the country. This will cause poverty and inflation.
So, it can be said that we are already paying the price of climate change. If we dont build consciousness and become aware, we will be in great danger in the near future.

Recent Flood in Bangladesh

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Recent Flood in Bangladesh
Bangladesh faced one of its worst floods in recent history in August 2024. Heavy monsoon rain began to fall around mid-August and then continued pouring for days. This caused the water level of the rivers to rise and overflow. The situation worsened when India released water from the dams in Tripura. It triggered the floodwaters to increase dangerously. The floods affected 11 districts in north-eastern and south-eastern Bangladesh, including Noakhali, Cumilla, Lakshmipur and Chattogram. A total of 73 upazilas and 528 unions were severely impacted.
The rising water damaged homes, roads, schools, and farms. It affected more than 5.8 million people all over the country. People had to leave their homes seeking safety. Many of them took shelter in evacuation shelters. On the other hand, many had to leave the city and move in with their relatives. Still, a great number of people remained trapped in their houses in the affected areas, waiting to be rescued. For many consecutive days, there was also no electricity, gas or mobile network. People started running out of their rations and safe drinking water.
The floodwaters also ruined agricultural fields, fishponds and livestock, causing millions of dollars in damage. A significant amount of crops were destroyed. It make the life harder for farmers. Contaminated water led to a serious health crisis as well, with a concerning outbreak of waterborne diseases.
A few days later, India released even more water from the Farakka Barrage. It worsened the situation in districts like Noakhali and Feni. By the end of August, the rain stopped and the floodwater slowly began to go down. However, it took time for everything to return to normal.
During this crisis, the government, army, navy, Fire Service, students, and various organizations like the As-Sunnah Foundation worked hard to help the flood victims. Many NGOs and volunteers provided food, clean water and medical help. Foreign countries also offered support. Citizens across Bangladesh supported relief efforts by donating money, clothes, dry food, medicine and other necessary items to help the flood victims. Despite the hardships, the people of Bangladesh showed strength and unity. They helped each other rebuilding their lives.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A Journey I Have Recently Made/Enjoyed
Or, A Railway Journey
Or, A Journey by Train
A journey by train is pleasant for everyone because it saves ones time, money and energy. Moreover, it is safe and interesting.
During the last winter vacation, I along with my parents made a journey by train from Dhaka to Chattogram to attend the wedding ceremony of my cousin.
We reached the station about half an hour before the departure of our train and bought tickets. The station offered a scene of great activities. Rickshaws, motor cars, etc. were coming to the station with passengers. Coolies were running behind them. There was a long queue before the ticket counter.
I managed to take my seat beside the window to enjoy the natural sights. At 7 a.m., the guard blew the whistle and the train started moving towards the destination and our journey began. The train first moved slowly, then it geared up quickly. Fresh wind began to enter the compartment. I began to enjoy beautiful sights. Every sight impressed me. The paddy fields and other trees were very beautiful to look at. In the train, it seemed to me that we were not moving but the trees, houses and other things outside the train were moving backwards speedily. In fact, the train was moving but they were still. I was charmed by this. Some were gossiping, some were sleeping in the compartment. Hawkers were selling their goods shouting their unique voice.
We enjoyed gossiping with our fellow travellers. Our train touched at few big stations and we bought boiled eggs, bananas and green coconuts and also some magazines. When we were in Chattogram, we saw many hills which gave me much delight.
At last, the train reached Chattogram Railway Station at 1.00 p.m. We got down from the train and saw my cousin waiting at the station. He had come to receive us. He became very pleased to see us.
The journey by train gave me much pleasure and experience. I wish I could make it again. Its memory will last in my mind as long as I live.

Question:
Satellite TV Channels and Our Young Generation

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Satellite TV Channels and Our Young Generation
Scientific inventions have made our life comfortable and enjoyable. They have brought almost the whole world into our living room. Satellite TV is such an invention of modern science. It is a very effective medium of recreation. The programmes shown by various channels are very attractive. Desire to know the unknown and to see the unseen is really fulfilled by the satellite TV channels. Channels of foreign countries help us to know the culture, tradition, etc, of those countries. Through satellite channels, we can get the current news of the world. Some channels telecast up-to-date news of the world and through documentary channels, we can learn numerous things. 
But sometimes, some channels telecast programmes which affect the viewers, specially our young generation, very adversely. Because of the influence of satellite TV channels, youths of our country are gradually being exposed to western values and modes of life. They are blindly following those. Forgetting their own culture, they are adopting the foreign culture. This is really a threat to our own culture and tradition.
Sometimes, they get so addicted to these channels that they spend more time in watching TV and neglect their studies. Consequently, they become lazy and good-for-nothing. These satellite channels are destroying the creativity of the youngsters and guiding them in the wrong way as they are more interested in watching fashion shows and musical shows and very few watch education-related programmes,
Again, some channels telecast indecent programmes, which leave very bad impact on their mind. Obscene and immoral films, dramas or music videos are influencing young generation. Indeed, violent films are often making young people aggressive and quarrelsome. These are the reasons of moral degradation and tremendous increase of social crime in our country.
Therefore, the government should put some restrictions on the telecast of the satellite TV channels. Guardians should encourage their children to watch the channels which telecast educational programmes. We must motivate our youths to take the good things from satellite TV channels and avoid the bad things. Family and educational institutions can play a major role in this regard.

Science in Everyday Life
Or, Blessings/Wonders of Modern Science
Science means knowledge gained through experiment and research. Science does many things for the development of human civilization. The modern age is a gift of science. Science has really a kind of magic in it. We can do anything with the help of modern science.
Our agricultural and industrial development is fully dependent on modern science. We now cultivate our land with power-tillers. The production of crops is increasing day by day with the help of chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Science also helps us in inventing new hybrid seeds. In industrial areas all the industries run with the knowledge and help of science. From needles to rockets, everything produced in industry is the contribution of science.
We see the influence of science at every step of our life. It has changed the mode of our life. It has created many things for our comfort. Science today has taken the possession of the world. The pen we write with, the shirt we put on, the bicycle we ride all are the contributions of science. Electricity has worked wonders. With the touch of switch, we get our lights dazzling, fans whirling and radios and televisions singing and talking. The gifts of science are always seen everywhere.
Telephone, mobile phone, fax, telegram, etc. are great wonders of science. We can instantly communicate with our desired person or persons through them. Radio and television are also great media for communication and recreation. Cinema, tape recorder, CD, VCD and DVD players, satellite TV, etc. are some remarkable gifts of science for our recreation.
Science has done a lot in diagnosing and treating patients. X-ray, CT scan, ultrasonography, ECG, biopsy, various life-saving antibiotics, etc. are the wonderful gifts of science. Modern medical science has given eyes to the blind, hearing to the deaf, legs to the lame and what not.
Science has made the world smaller and faster. Buses, trains, aeroplanes, etc. can take us from one place to another within a short period of time. Computer and internet are the greatest wonders of modern science. They are doing various difficult tasks for us within a very short time.
Sometimes, science becomes a curse. Science is for the benefit of mankind but out of selfish motive man misuses science and brings untold sufferings. Some scientists have invented some dreadful weapons. Tanks, missiles, torpedoes, atom and hydrogen bombs can easily destroy the world in a moment.
The invention of science is to do good to human beings. Science brings happiness and prosperity. But if it is misused, it may bring destruction.

Population Problem in Bangladesh

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Population Problem in Bangladesh
Or, Population Explosion in Bangladesh
Population is an asset to a country when she can turn it into a useful manpower and provide them with all basic necessities. But it becomes a problem for a country when she fails to provide them with employment opportunity and the basic needs of life.
Bangladesh is an over-populated country. She is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. The density of population in our country is about 1350 per square kilometre. The present growth rate of population in Bangladesh is 1.8. Now, over-population is a great problem for our country.
Population explosion is destroying all the efforts for our development. Our population is increasing day by day but the land is not increasing. Our land is fixed. Other facilities for living also are not increasing in proportion to the increase of population. So, the problems of shelter, food, clothing, medical treatment, housing, education, entertainment, etc. are increasing gradually. It also causes various disturbances in the society. Because of it, everything is becoming bad to worst. So, various socio-economic and political problems are created for population explosion in Bangladesh.
We must come forward to control our population. We should adopt family planning measures effectively. Each family must live in a planned way so that they can turn their children into asset. No family should have more than two children. Early marriage and polygamy must be banned.
Most of the people of our country are farmers. They are not educated. They want to have more sons than daughters. They think that their sons will help them. This wrong idea should be removed to control population. Besides, people living in rural areas are religiously fundamental. To control population, this mentality must be removed as early as possible. Therefore, education of the mass is a must. In this regard, private and public initiative should be taken. Only combined efforts can resolve this problem.
The government alone cannot solve this problem. Educated people of the society must play an important role in this respect. If we can check our population explosion, we can develop our country day by day.

Question:
The Season I Like Most/The Spring in Bangladesh

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Season I Like Most/The Spring in Bangladesh
There are six seasons in Bangladesh. They are summer, rainy, autumn, late autumn, winter and spring. Every season has its unique features. Of all these seasons I like the spring most. This season consists of the Bangla months of Falgun and Chaitra. It is the best, the loveliest and the most charming of all the seasons. It is called the king of all seasons. It is the last of six seasons in Bangladesh. There are some specific reasons why I like the spring most.
To me, the winter is very cold, dull and lifeless. In summer, the scorching sun, hot days and nights make life miserable. The heavy rain and frequent floods in the rainy season bring great sufferings to the people. The autumn and the late autumn have also more or less disadvantages like the summer, rainy and winter seasons. But the spring has none of the inconveniences of these seasons. Coming after winter, it captivates the hearts of all.
With the arrival of the spring, nature puts on a lively look. The spring season gives a fresh start and new lives to the trees which shed their leaves in winter. Everything in the nature looks fresh. The sky looks clear and blue, trees put forth new leaves. The flowers of charming colour and scent bloom in trees. Bees and butterflies hum and fly from one flower to another. During this season, gentle breeze begins to blow. Sweet twitters of birds are heard everywhere. The melodious songs of the cuckoo sooth our mind. All these charming and pleasing sights and sounds have a positive influence on our mind. Everywhere there is joy and mirth. People also enjoy a better health. Besides, during this time, various kinds of vegetables and fruits are also available in our country.
The season has a few disadvantages, too. During this season, some people suffer from diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, chicken-pox, etc.
In spite of its few disadvantages, its positive aspects are overwhelming. The convenience it offers fascinates all. Thats why, I like the spring season most.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Students and Social Services
Or, Service Rendered by the Students to Build up Our Nation
Students are the future leaders and makers of a nation. They are the devotees in the temple of learning. So, the most important duty of students is to study seriously with devotion. It does not mean that they are isolated from the society. They are also social beings like other classes of people. They enjoy the same social benefits, rights and privileges. So, as members of society, they have certain duties to the society in which they live in. There are many kinds of social services and students have a lot to do in these sectors.
Living in a developing country like ours, students must render some social services for the development and welfare of the nation. So during the long vacation and leisure time, students can open night schools and teach the illiterate working children and adult people. They can also teach the farmers about the modern methods of cultivation, the use of fertilizers and proper caring of crops. They can also suggest them to dig a pond for fish cultivation or to make a farm.
Students can render immense service in the field of health. The village people and the people living in the slums have no knowledge about health, nutrition and sanitation. The students can teach them about the basic rules of health, nutrition and sanitation. Female students can also teach the uneducated women how to keep their houses neat and clean, how to bring up children and look after their health.
Students can prove themselves to be worthy citizens during natural disasters. In times of flood, famine and cyclone, earthquake and epidemic, they can come forward to help the affected people. They can collect money from the rich, rescue the affected, feed the hungry, nurse the sick and clothe the unclothed. During epidemics, medical students can serve the sick with food, clothes and medicine.
Students are a great source of strength to the country. They have ideals, energy and power to work. If they are rightly guided, they can really render very valuable service to society. There must be selfless leaders to make right use of them. Under proper guidance and noble inspiration they can do wonders.

There are different kinds of exercises like free hand exercises, yoga, running, swimming, weight lifting, gymnastics, acrobatics etc. Different kinds of games such as football, cricket, hockey, badminton etc. are good forms of health exercises.

The importance of physical exercise in our practical life is great. It helps us to build a sound body. It improves our health and makes a man strong and active.

In our country, some people do not take physical exercise. They think that it is unnecessary and mere killing of time. But, in fact, they are wrong. By taking physical exercise, we can remain healthy and do our respective jobs properly. Without physical exercise, sour health breaks down and we suffer from various diseases and complications. We should take exercise according to our age and condition of our body. Then we can be benefited easily from every kind of exercise.
Physical exercise is necessary to build a nation. Healthy children are the healthy citizens of the future. So, we should all take physical exercise regularly as a part and parcel of our daily life to live a healthy and happy life.

Question:
36 July

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
36 July
36 July is a special term in Bangladesh. It refers to 5 August 2024, a day of great change and a historic moment for the people of Bangladesh. On this day, the autocrate regime, which lasted over 15 years, collapsed. In this way, the dictatorship came to an end. The then Prime Minister, had to resign and flee the country because of a mass uprising.
The events leading to '36 July' began earlier in June 2024. On 5 June, the High Court Division restored the quota system in government jobs. This decision upset the general students, who wanted reforms in the system. As a result, they began their protest. By 16 July, the situation turned violent as the government tried to suppress the movement. Law enforcement agencies were deployed to suppress the students. They fired bullets at students and innocent people, charged with batons and detained the protesters, but could not stop them from protesting. On 21 July, the Supreme Court supported the demand for quota reform. However, the protesters had more demands. They sought justice for the killings during the protests, which they referred to as the 'July Massacre'. To put emphasis on the continuation of the protest, the students started counting the days of July beyond its usual 31 days. For them, 1 August became '32 July', and this counting continued.
The protest grew stronger. On 4 August, the protesters announced a non-cooperation movement, naming the day '35 July'. The next day, 5 August, was marked as '36 July'. On this day, thousands of people marched to Dhaka from different parts of Bangladesh. The mass uprising forced the then Prime Minister to resign and flee the country. The protesters called their success the 'Second Independence' or 'Rebirth Day'.
The term 36 July is now a symbol of unity and courage. It appears in murals, graffiti and art across the country. It reminds us of the peoples power and shows that unity and bravery can bring about meaningful change.

The biggest advantage of reading a newspaper is that it adds value in our life. It improves our English or any other language in which we are reading in it. It enhances our confidence. It actually makes lives easier as we are updated with the current information around us. It also increases our reading skills and indirectly writing skills as well.
Sometimes, many fabricated or false pieces of information are also published in newspapers. This is called yellow journalism that results in great problems in society. So, the authorities or writers must be conscious of the interests of the people. Otherwise, it might hamper national and international relations. In developing international relations, newspapers act as a medium. They also offer various job advertisements. So, they are helpful in removing unemployment. The stories and novels published in newspapers give us much pleasure. So, considering all these, it can be said that reading newspapers is a must to cope with the changing world and be informed of current affairs.

Question:
My Favourite Game

Or, Cricket-My Favourite Game

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
My Favourite Game
Or, Cricket-My Favourite Game
At present, cricket is one of the most popular games in the world, especially in South Asia. Like many people of this region, I love to enjoy this game very much. In fact, it has been my most favourite game and I don't miss any chance to enjoy it.
The most important reason for which I like this game is that a single match is full of occasions when the spectators get enthralled and excited. On the part of the batsmen, there are sixes and fours, Every boundary and over boundary gives the spectators so much excitement. Then, there are singles, twos, threes, etc. which also entertain the spectators greatly. On the part of the bowlers, there are inswings, outswings, yorkers, etc, and these things give much pleasure to the spectators. However, the most exciting event for the bowlers is the fall of wickets. Besides, the fielders also eentertain the spectators with extraordinary catches, breathtaking run-outs, and acrobatic body movement on the ground and even in the air.
Secondly, this game is termed as a game of uncertainty. This is a unique characteristic of any cricket match. Most often, none can say which team will win the match. When the match ends in the last over or in the last ball of the innings, the pleasures and excitement of winning team's players and the spectators know no bounds. Thirdly, it is also called the gentlemens game. The players are usually gentle, polite and very considerate in their behaviour. While in the other games, there are many incidents of physical conflicts between or among the players, in cricket, they usually stay far away from one another. Furthermore, the umpires in the field also stand in the field and can easily watch over any unwanted incidents among the players. As a result, players hardly involve in any conflict, let alone physical clashes.
Finally, this game requires the players to work hard in a disciplined manner. They have to take regular physical exercise to maintain their fitness. So, they usually enjoy a sound health.
In conclusion, I take pride in being a fan of such a fantastic game like cricket. I not only enjoy watching cricket matches, but also love to play it with the local boys.

Question:
My Aim in Life

Or, My Future Plan of Life

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
My Aim in Life
Or, My Future Plan of Life
Man aims for his future. An aimless life is like a boat without a rudder that can never reach its goal. To succeed in life one should have a future plan from one's early life. This is called an aim in life. Therefore, it can be said that one's aim is one's future plan for life.
Now I am a student. I believe that this period is a unique opportunity to do something and to succeed in life. I have decided to be a teacher. I know it is a very hard task. But I want to develop my nation. A teacher can lead the nation to the highest stage of prosperity if he can properly teach the students with his ideals.
I want to serve the nation through proper teaching. A good teacher lives in the mind of the people of a nation forever. Our nation is a poor one. Illiteracy is a vital cause of our poverty. It is the root of all of our obstacles. If our students are properly educated, they can alleviate our poverty. By being a teacher, I am determined to serve the nation.
In order to fulfil my future plan, I must acquire some degrees. I sympathise all students who fail in English. So, I want to be a teacher of English. After passing my HSC Examination, I will get myself admitted into Honour's in English. After completing my Honour's and Master's degrees, I shall join a college to teach the students with my best effort. I would like to choose a rural area as my working place.
I would like to serve my country sincerely. The condition of English in our country is very poor. I would like to improve it. If our nation is capable enough to communicate internationally, she can easily reach her destination to prosperity. Though English is a foreign language, we hardly can do anything without it in this age. I shall teach my students the four skills of language listening, speaking, reading and writing within the shortest possible time.
I pray to Allah for the success of my future plan. I have been studying heart and soul to build up a strong background of English in me. Apart from the school texts, I regularly go through English newspapers, magazines, periodicals, journals, etc. to improve my stock of vocabulary. I hope I shall be able to translate my aim or future plan into reality by the grace of Almighty creator.

My Childhood Memories

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
My Childhood Memories
Man loves to turn back to his past and feel nostalgic. Childhood is an important part of human life as many events of both pleasure and pain take place during that period.
To me childhood is the sweetest period in a man's life. The memories of my childhood haunt me like a passion very often. Whenever I feel very lonely or dejected, I dive into the memories of my childhood, remove my loneliness and fill my heart with happiness. Then, I wish I could be a child again!
The memories of my school days dominate my childhood. I was sent to school at six. I studied in a distant primary school named Kanchichora Government Primary school upto class two. Then I was made to take my admission in another school called Mathbari Government Primary School. I used to go to school with my village friends. My cousin who was one year senior to me was my constant school-going companion. In school the classes were not much interesting to me but the leisure period while we used to play various sports. I was a regular student in my class. So I was hardly beaten or scolded by my teachers for negligence to studies. After the school was over, in our way home, we used to play ha-du-du, hide and seek, gather plums or steal green mangoes from some trees and sometimes used to hath in stream. One day I along with my three friends went to a friend's house to eat green-plum. But as the tree was long, none of us dared to climb it up. Hence, we had to come back in a dissatisfied mind.
In my school I was not a good athlete. Yet I used to take part in various events. Once I got two prizes in race and long-jump and therefore became very excited and happy. The holidays were favourite to me. On holidays I used to play with my friends almost the whole day.
Sometimes I would go to some other village for play. I also would visit my nearby relatives on holidays. How happy I was in my childhood days! The happy and pleasant memories of those days still give me pleasure. If I could go back to those days again!

Uses and abuses of Computer in Our Life

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Uses and abuses of Computer in Our Life
We live in an age of science. Science is inventing wonder after wonder and magic after magic like ALADINS magic lamp. It has made impossible possible. We feel the impact of science almost in every walk of our life. For example, computer has brought a great change in our life. Now we can do calculations with great speed and accuracy. It can process, manipulate, reproduce and communicate data at a very high speed. We cannot imagine life without computer.
In addition, computer is an electronic device used for storing and analyzing information fed into it, for calculating, or for controlling machinery automatically. They do automatic fine tuning and colour regulating on television sets and other household gadgets. In offices, computer is used to maintain records, files, prepare payrolls apart from performing various other functions. In hospital, computer is used to diagnose diseases. It helps in carrying out surgeries.
Moreover, computer is rendering valuable service to the radars, missiles, rocket launching, automatic flights, etc. We have pilotless aeroplanes which are controlled by computers from the ground stations. Airlines and railways are now offering instant information on bookings with the help of computers. Computers help big business houses in carrying out their up-to-date business. Computers are widely used to solve climatic, industrial, commercial, financial and other complicated problems. In advanced countries, computers are used to regulate and control traffic.
However, computer is not blessing in all. It has caused to create many problems. A computer can perform works of several people. It has increased the rate of unemployment. It has replaced scores of people. Often the mistakes made by computers are really blunders. Excessive dependence of man on computers have reduced mental efficiency in human beings. Internet is often used for mischievous intentions. They are used to send false e-mails for malicious intentions to harass the person. Some others try to view those websites that are not meant for them. This is a bad tendency and must be checked. Internet should be for development and other good purposes and not for destruction and decay.
Computers have many shortcomings. However, their advantages far outweigh their disadvantages. They are integral part of modern life. We cannot think of life without computers.

Question:
Uses and Abuses of Internet

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Uses and Abuses of Internet
Internet is the latest miracle that has ushered in a revolution in the application of science for the benefit of mankind. It is the computer-based global information system. By accessing to internet today, the vast treasure of all forms of knowledge, information, inventions, techniques, process, technologies, arts, literature etc. can be made available. It has made inroads into all walks of our life.
The internet is composed of many interconnected computer networks. Each network may link tens, hundreds and even thousands of computers, enabling them to share information with one another and to share computational resources such as powerful super computers and databases of information.
Today through internet, people all over the world can communicate effectively and inexpensively with one another. Unlike traditional broadcasting media, such as radio and television, the internet does not have centralised distribution system.
In this world of globalisation and IT revolution, internet is the key player to make it happen so. The internet has brought about new opportunities to government, business and education. Government uses the internet for internal communication, distribution of information and automated tax processing. In Bangladesh, the use of internet has taken a leap in the last few years. The government of our country can take it as an aid to decision making process for each agency and ministry of the government. This can help bringing transparency in the very process of governance. In addition to offering goods and services on line to customers, business men use internet to connect with other business men. Today many individuals use the internet for shopping, paying bills and online banking. Educational institutions use the internet for research and to deliver courses to students on line at remote sites.
Not to say, it has some abuses too. Nowadays especially the teen agers are very prone to absorb the demerits of internet. They sometimes keep chatting and whiling away their time with their friends or even unknown persons when they are supposed to be at their desk to study. They tend to enjoy pornography and do many immoral and hazardous tasks diving into dark webs. Thus, they are going away from their study and becoming morally degraded. In addition, sometimes criminal and terrorists take the advantage of internet to actualize their target. They exploit Cyber Cafe as their means of fulfilling their task. To belittle and derogate others, some heinous and immoral persons mail many messages and vulgar pictures to different addresses.
In fine, we should use internet sorting the best out of it so that we ourselves can be benefited and can benefit others too. To keep pace with the rest of the world in every sector, we must be connected with internet.

Graffiti allows people to express their thoughts and emotions creatively. During the July Revolution of 2024 in our country, graffiti became a vital tool for protest. After the assassination of a student activist named Abu Sayeed in Rangpur, students painted a mural with the words, &quot;Who will bring justice for the murder of martyr Abu Sayeed?&quot; Although the mural was removed the next morning, it left a lasting impression. After the fall of the dictatorial government on 5 August 2024, graffiti spread across Bangladesh. Students painted walls to honor martyrs and support the revolution. Slogans appeared on walls in Dhaka and other parts of the country, alongside symbols like clenched fists and the rising sun. Graffiti became a way to exercise freedom of speech and draw attention to ignored issues. Students, artists, and even rickshaw pullers joined the movement, with donations supporting their efforts. Graffiti has since become a voice for the people, symbolizing hope and unity.

Dengue Fever is a viral disease caused by mosquito bites. Aedes mosquitos are responsible for the transmission of this virus. The virus easily spreads from people to mosquitos and from mosquitos to people. Once a person is affected by this virus, a mosquito bearing no germs of dengue can be loaded up with the virus while biting the infected person.

Otherwise, it may lead the person to the risk of death. Some factors are responsible for the rising number of dengue cases in Bangladesh, such as global warming leading to a rise in global temperature, increased level of humidity, and finally, greater quantity of rainfall causing more pools of stagnant water to be formed.

Anti-discrimination Student Movement

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Anti-discrimination Student Movement
The Anti-discrimination Student Movement in Bangladesh took place in July 2024. It was a protest against the unfair quota system in government jobs. In June, the High Court announced a 30% quota for the descendants of freedom fighters. Since 26% of jobs were already reserved for other groups, only 44% of positions remained for general applicants. Students found this decision unfair and demanded jobs based on merit. This was the third major protest on this issue, after similar ones in 2013 and 2018. Students skipped classes, blocked roads, and staged demonstrations across the country. The protests continued intensely for days without any solution. In mid-July, the situation turned violent when armed attackers injured hundreds of protesting students. The movement quickly became a fight against the government itself. Students raised their voices against the authoritarian system. On August 3, they announced a one-point demand for the government's resignation. Finally, on August 5, the student-led movement succeeded. Their unity and determination overthrew the government. This movement became a symbol of the students' fight for fairness and justice in Bangladesh.

The Life of a Farmer

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Life of a Farmer
A farmer is the person who cultivates lands and grows different types of crops to earn his bread. Generally, a farmer is a poor man and lives in the village. In Bangladesh, the life of a farmer is pitiable. Most of the farmers have no land of their own. So, most of the time he has to cultivate the land of others. Usually, a farmer is an illiterate person. He does not know how to plough his land scientifically. He cannot apply scientific method. He has only a pair of bullocks and some hand-made tools. Often he does not have enough money to buy seeds, fertilizer or pesticide. As a result, he cannot produce more food for himself and his family. He lives from hand to mouth. He also has pleasures and pains in life. If he gets a good harvest, his face beams with joy. On the other hand, if the harvest is not good, his sorrows know no bounds. He works hard to prepare the land for planting or sowing crops. As the farmers grow and reap the harvest, we have our food. By working hard in the field, he grows a bumper crop which helps develop our national economy. We know that ours is an agricultural country with more than 80 percent of her population directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture. So, our economy is mostly dependent on agriculture. To promote the development of national economy, the farmers should be helped with agricultural subsidies by the government. They should be encouraged to use tractors instead of the age-old ploughs. They should also be taught to use the modern cultivation methods. This is how, the life of a farmer can be developed.

Word Meaning: cultivate (v.) - চাষ করা; grow (v.) - জন্মানো; pitiable (adj.) - শোচনীয়; illiterate (adj.) - অশিক্ষিত; plough (v.) - লাঙল দিয়ে চাষ করা; scientifically (adv.) - বৈজ্ঞানিকভাবে; pesticide (n.) - কীটনাশক; harvest (n.) - ফসল; sorrows know no bound (phr.) - দুঃখের কোনো সীমা নেই এমন engaged (v.) - নিয়োজিত; bumper crop (phr.) - প্রচুর পরিমাণ শস্য; subsidies (n.) - ভর্তুকি; age-old (adj.) - অনেক পুরোনো।

The major part of it is deep green and there is a red circle in the middle of it. The radius of the circle is one-fifth of the length of the flag. Its deep green colour stands for everlasting youth, freshness and vigour of our nation. It also symbolises the greenery of Bangladesh. On the other hand, the red circle symbolises the rising sun of independence. It also stands for the supreme sacrifices of our heroic freedom fighters, who laid down their lives for the independence of our motherland. The flag is hoisted every day on the top of the buildings of government semi-government offices and educational institutions. Moreover, it is hoisted everywhere on the Independent Day and the Victory Day. Besides, it is kept half-mast on our national mourning days.

Last Sunday, I witnessed a tragic street accident. It took place near our school. There is a turning there. It is an interchange of five roads. Now and then, there occurs a traffic jam. On that day, while I was going to school, I saw a car coming from the western direction. A rickshaw, with a school boy and his mother, was coming from the opposite direction at about 8:30 a.m. While crossing the point, the car hit the rickshaw. The rickshawpuller was able to jump from his seat but the boy and his mother fell on the street. The boy and his mother were seriously wounded. I rushed to them. Some other passers-by also came forward to help them. We led them to a nearby doctor's chamber. I felt pity for the school boy, he was of my age. In fact, for having no traffic police at that place, such accidents frequently occur. The authority should take steps to stop road accidents that very often claim peoples' lives.

The general people have to face untold sufferings. They reach late at their working places. Students, employees, businessmen, workers all suffer tremendously for this. It occurs mostly during office and school or college time. During traffic jam, we feel extremely bored as it kills our valuable time.

Question:
A Winter Morning

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A Winter Morning
A winter morning is cold and foggy. Everything seems hazy and indistinct. Grasses are wet with dew drops. However, when the sun rises, dew drops sparkle like pearls. Old people and children shiver in cold. Poor people gather straw and make fire to bask in the heat. Animals, too, are helpless. They hide themselves in the corner of the house and try to save themselves from the biting cold outside. Elderly people and children usually get up a bit late to evade cold of the early morning. Working people go out when the fog disappears and the sun seems brighter. People sometimes eat homemade cakes with date juice and enjoy the warmth of the early sun while sitting outside their homes. Bangalees settled abroad make it an occasion to return and spend the winter in Bangladesh. They find the winter here pleasant as the winter in any European country is tremendously cold. A winter morning in Bangladesh is thus quite fascinating for them. My personal feeling about a winter morning is that it is a bane for the poor but a boon for the rich.

Gusty wind blows from all sides. Birds keep standing on branches of trees or keep quiet in their nests. Cattle remain in their sheds and bellow for the fodder. Water stands here and there. Unpitched roads become muddy and slippery. Passers-by have to walk with umbrella over their head, shoes in hand and pants folded up to the knee. Sometimes people slip and fall on the muddy road. In cities, a rainy day is now a horror. The roads and streets in some towns and cities get flooded. Vehicles are seen stranding in knee-deep water in some areas due to water clogging. It causes gridlock across the city. It is a day of trouble and annoyance to the office-going people. They have to suffer from various inconveniences. But for the school going children, it is a delight to have a rainy day. If it rains heavily before their school time, they get a holiday. Sometimes, children, especially the boys play football in the rainwater in the nearby fields. A rainy day is a curse for the poor. The day labourers cannot go out for work and hence, they have to suffer a lot. However, I pass the day by listening to music, watching TV or reading journals. In short, a rainy day is a day of both pleasure and pain.

A social networking service is basically a platform where people can build social relations based on similar interests, activities and even real life events. Among all other social networks, Facebook is seen to be growing at the fastest rate and hence is the most popular. Before Facebook, another social network 'Hi5' dominated the field of the social networking services. Facebook eventually beat Hi5 and took its place with a higher number of users. Apart from Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Instagram are some of the other popular social networks. Social networking sites allow people to have free accounts with which they can connect with people from all parts of the world. There are facilities of privacy settings with which people can enjoy these social networks and also eliminate stalkers and problematic people. The accounts are free for regular people but people who use these social networks for business purposes have to pay a charge to the owners of these networks. Communication has become much easier with social networking services. People can stay connected with their loved ones no matter what the distance is. Photo sharing and video sharing features make it easier for people to know what their close and distant ones are doing. Some of these networks, such as Facebook, allow chatting and video calling which makes communication even better. As long as people know the limit of using social networking services, they pose no harm to the society.

Word Meaning: feature (n.) - বৈশিষ্ট্য; compatible (adj.) - সুসঙ্গত; somehow (adv.) - কোনোভাবে; keep up with (phr.) - তালমিলিয়ে চলা; growing trend (phr.) - জনপ্রিয় ধারা; interest (n.) - পছন্দ; dominate (v.) - কর্তৃত্ব করা; eliminate (v.) - বাদ দেওয়া; stalker (n.) - অনুসরণকারী; stay connected (phr.) - সংযুক্ত থাকা; distant (adj.) - দূরবর্তী; pose (v) - আরোপ করা।

Options:


Correct Answer:

3 January 2025

Dear Limon,
I hope you are passing happy days. In your last letter, you wanted to know what I would do after my SSC Examination.
Well, I have made up my mind to go to my village then. I shall open an adult literacy centre there. I shall try my best to remove their illiteracy. I shall also make them aware of the rules of health and sanitation. Besides, I shall try to make them free from prejudices and superstitions. I would also like to make them aware of the bad effects of early marriage of their daughters and of gender disparity. I have an intention to visit Coxs Bazar as well.
No more today. Write me about your plans soon. With best regards to your parents and love to the younger ones.

Yours ever,

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
28 Subidbazar, Sylhet
27 February, 2025

Dear Maliha,
At first, take my cordial love. I hope you are doing fine. In one of the letters, you wrote that you wanted to know how I had celebrated the last 21 February in my school. Today I am writing to you about it. Every year, our teachers organize a day full of activities to commemorate the martyrs and celebrate our language, culture and history. This year was not different. With the national flag hoisted half-mast, we began our day by placing flowers at the Shaheed Minar in our school. After paying tributes, we attended the rally holding various placards and then marched around the town. Back in school, the authorities had arranged a cultural program where students sang different songs dedicated to the day, some recited poems and teachers gave a brief speech on the significance of 21 February. Around noon, there was an art competition for the students and I participated with my classmates even though I do not know how to draw.
No more today. Tell me how you celebrated your 21 February this year. Warm regards to your parents.

Your friend,
Sabina Yasmin

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
40/C Muradpur, Chattogram
23 June 2025

Dear Rana,
Hope everything is fine at your end. Today, I am going to tell you how I spent my summer vacation.
I had a summer vacation of fifteen days. So, I went to my native village with my parents to see my grandparents and uncles. I ate a lot of fresh summer fruits produced in our orchard and enjoyed the days a lot. But I was not only idling away my free time, I actually exploited my vacation in true sense. You will be glad to know that I had gathered almost 20 illiterate villagers of my village at the backyard of our house and taught them many things. My local friends and cousins also helped me in this regard. We taught them about the hygiene, sanitary latrine, population problem, early marriage, dowry, and necessity of education, female education and scientific ways of producing crops. The villagers were very pleased and thankful. They requested us to organize more such programmes in future.
No more today. Tender my regards to your honourable parents.

Yours ever,
Rupam

Solution:
40/3 College Road, Dhaka
16 January 2025

My dear Joy,
Hope you are well by the grace of the Almighty. I have come to learn that you are not interested to go through newspapers regularly. It is very disappointing. Anyone, reading newspaper, can know many things of the world. By knowing the news and views of the world, you can use them in your practical life. Moreover, newspaper reading is a part and parcel of education. So, be serious about reading newspapers. If not, you will remain simply a book worm, and it will not help you much in your future life.
No more today. Convey my best regards to your parents.

Solution:
9, Tajmahal, Station Road, Mymensingh
10 February 2025

Dear Nahid,
It was a pleasant surprise to receive your letter a few days ago. Thank you for the card you sent me along with your letter. In your writing, you wanted to know the details about my study tour to the historical place in Sonargaon, Narayanganj.
Well, it was in the last month. The students of classes 9-10 arranged the study tour. Two of our honourable teachers supervised the whole tour. We started to gather at the school gate around 7:00 am in the morning. It was pretty cold but the sight of our tour bus made us excited. The bus started off before 8 am. Soon the breakfast was served. We reached Sonargaon by 9:30 am. It was a jaw-dropping experience when we entered the historical Panam city. We all were impressed by the serene sight. I personally felt as if we had been walking through the history book. The spooky but enchanting ancient doors of the buildings around us boggled our mind. We took many photographs. Some of the members got busy taking selfie using their smart phones. We also took group photographs. One of the most interesting aspects of the tour was a brief class lecture by our teachers while we were inspecting the architecture of the ancient buildings. We learned that those historical buildings were built centuries ago and are related with the history of Baro Bhuiyan. As the capital of the 15 century Bengal ruler Isa Khan, Sonargaon showcases the architecture of the Sultanates, Mughal and colonial periods. It was really an unforgettable experience for me.
No more today. My best wishes will always be with you. Convey my regards to your parents.

Yours ever,
Shahin

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
12 Green Road, Dhaka, Bangladesh
10 January 2025

Dear Jovan,
It's really delightful to hear from you after a long time. It makes me happy that you want to know about my country.
Let's start with the geographical position of this small country. It is a South-Asian country surrounded by India on three sides and the Bay of Bengal on the south. Myanmar lies to her south-east. Its area is 1,48,460 square kilometres where about 160 million people live. So you see the density of population in our country is high. The country achieved independence in 1971 after fighting against the well-equipped Pakistani Army for nine months. We are the only nation who has the glory of fighting for its mother language. Our Language Movement took place in 1952. Bangladesh is marked as a country of beauty. There are many places of tourist attraction in Bangladesh. We have a long cultural tradition, literature, arts, etc. that are very developed and have acquired international recognition.
The people in Bangladesh are very hard-working, ready to face any obstacles. They are very hospitable. They become very happy when they have a guest at home and try their best to entertain the guest. They like to talk a lot, even to the strangers or foreigners. People here are much curious about foreigners.
Anyway, the letter is getting long. No more today. I would like to invite you to visit my country as soon as possible. Take care.

With love,
Anuvob

Dear Anika/ Abrar,
How are you? Hope you are doing fine. I am fine, too. Today, I would like to describe a train journey that I made recently.
A few days ago, I along with my parents went to Mymensingh by train. On the day, we reached Kamalapur Railway Station very early in the morning. The station was very crowded. We boarded the train and took our seats. I chose a window seat. At 7:30 am, the train blew its whistle and started moving slowly. After a few minutes, it gained speed. Soon, we left the crowded city and entered the countryside. We were passing through the green fields. The farmers were ploughing the fields and taking care of the crops. Shepherds were grazing cattle in the fields. Children were seen playing in the field and making faces at us. Women were washing clothes and taking bath in the ponds. As the train was moving, the trees seemed running backwards. Everything was coming to sight quite fast and then disappearing even faster. The sun was trying to peep through the clouds. Indeed, the scenery was very charming. We passed by many small and big towns. The train finally reached Mymensingh at 10:30 am. Truly, it was a pleasant journey by train. I still cherish the memory of the journey in my mind.
No more today. Please, convey my greetings to aunty, uncle and your little brother Pranto.

Dear Nafiza,
My heartiest compliments go to you. Hope that you are hale and hearty. In your last letter, you wanted to know about the co-curricular activities of my school.
You know that I am lucky to study in such a big and famous school which offers us facilities to learn a lot of things besides studies. We can depend on our teachers not only for study matters but also for matters related to our interests. Some of them run activity clubs in school. The clubs are places where one can go and pursue his or her hobby. I am a member of the debating club. We practice debating within the club and arrange debating competitions among classes and with other schools as well. Our English teacher, who runs this club, not only guides us in writing good speeches but also shows us how to present them. Our school arranges essay competitions and book reading competitions. Moreover, my school offers a wide range of extra-curricular activities for the students. The school has a musical group and a lot of plays are staged by the students. Besides, the students enjoy hockey and football as extra-curricular activities. Teachers consult with the students at personal level and encourage them to work more and more. The students of this school learn not only for examinations but also for life. In short, studying in this school is a great experience for me.
I guess you are planning to shift to a new school. If you ask my suggestion, I will recommend my school without any hesitation.

With best wishes,
Monika

30 January 2025

Dear Badhan,
I received your letter yesterday. It is praiseworthy that you're going well with your study. At the same time, I want to give you an advice to take physical exercise regularly. You know that &quot;A sound mind remains in a sound body&quot;. So, to keep your body fit, you should take physical exercise daily. If you avoid it, your body will get rusty. You will feel uneasy all the times. Without soundness in your body, you will become inattentive to your study. But you should become careful of the rules of exercise. Otherwise, it may hamper your health. However, you must have a proper guideline for this. I hope you will inform me your details soon.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
120 Ibrahimpur
Dhaka Cantonment, Dhaka
5 January 2025

My dear Anu,
Hope you are well by the grace of Allah. I am also fine.
Well, I returned home safely. But now, I am missing your company as well as your family members. Indeed, I had a very nice time with you and your family. You took much trouble for me. You accompanied me visiting different historic places of the city. I was very delighted to acquire knowledge about those attractive places. Again, I can not but remember the hospitality your family offered me. All of your family members behaved with me very well. It seemed that I was like a member of your family. Your parents treated me like their own son. Your elder sister is an amiable person. She entertained me much telling many stories and funny jokes. I wish I had an elder sister like yours. However, I must thank all of you for your hospitality and entertainment.
Let me know when you will visit our house. No more today. Convey my best regards to your parents and Ranu Apa and affection to the younger ones.

Yours ever,
Mahmud

Question:
Suppose, you are Abid/Abida, Naveed is your younger brother. You have heard that he is keeping some evil companions nowadays. Now, write an email to your younger brother advising him to avoid evil company.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To : naveed_n12@gmail.com
Subject : Advising to avoid evil company
Dear Naveed,
I hope you are hale and hearty, I am also keeping well. But I have heard that you are not keeping good company around you. It is, indeed, a bad news for me.
In your last annual exam, you did not perform well. Your marks were visibly poor. I believe the main reason for this demotion is the bad company you are keeping. The people you are having around these days are not attentive to studies. Studying hard and gaining knowledge are not their concerns. Also, some of them are heavily addicted to smoking. Some of them do not go to school regularly. If you continue mixing with them, it will affect your studies further. You will also develop bad habits like smoking, bunking off classes, being irregular in the classes, etc. So, I would request you to stay away from evil company. No more today. Keep in touch.
Your loving sister,
Abida

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To : sagor_bd@gmail.com
Subject : The causes and effects of road accidents
My dear Sagor,
Thank you for your message. Today, I like to share my concern about frequent road accidents. Road accident has become a daily occurrence in our country. The real causes of road accidents lie with the people and not with the mechanised means of transport. Reckless driving and overtaking tendency of the drivers are responsible for most of the accidents. Sometimes, they lose control over steering that leads to accidents. Violation of traffic rules by both the pedestrians and the drivers also causes road accidents. In some cities, roads are too narrow and inadequate. These can hardly cope with the ever-increasing volume of traffic. Every year, thousands of people die and many more get injured in road accidents. Sometimes, the injured have to embrace disability forever. Road accidents have become a great menace in our society. Stern steps must be taken to check this danger. Spacious roads should be constructed and traffic signals should be set up at the key points. Heavy penalty should be imposed on those who violate the traffic rules. Moreover, common people should be made aware of the traffic rules through radio, television, newspapers and posters.
Ok, I will be longing for your further text.
Your friend,
Sabuj

My dear Ricky,
Take my love and affection. I received your email yesterday. From your email I have learned that you don't like reading newspaper. I became really shocked knowing this. Its a great mistake of yours. Reading newspapers is one of the best habits of human beings. A newspaper is a storehouse of knowledge. By
reading newspaper, you can learn about different cultures, politics, economics, literature, sports and various things from all over the world, You can't remain ignorant of the incidents happening around you either in your country or in the world. If you keep yourself isolated; you will be proved unfit for the world. Carrying news of all the national and international events the newspaper comes to our door every morning. So, I advise you to read newspaper daily. You can learn about politics, economy, education, sports, etc. from the newspaper. It will enrich your language skill and vocabulary, as well. So, I think it is high time you changed your habit.
Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you. No more today. Stay fine.

Dear Rana,
I received your letter yesterday. It is praiseworthy that you're going well with your study. At the same time, I want to give you an advice to take physical exercise regularly. You know that &quot;A sound mind remains in a sound body.&quot; So, to keep your body fit, you should take physical exercise daily. You are already suffering from leg pain. Still you are not taking any sort of physical exercise. If you avoid doing exercise on a regular basis, your body will get rusty. You will feel uneasy all the times. Without soundness in your body, you will be inattentive to your study. But you should become careful of the rules of exercise. Otherwise, it may hamper your health. You must have a proper guideline for this. I think, you will inform me your details soon.
How're our parents? Convey my best wishes to Tuhin and Shaon. No more today.

Many of us come to school from distant places. Often our classes continue from 10 am to 4 pm. To pass this long time, we need a good tiffin. Most often we have to take tiffin from roadside restaurants. These restaurants are not only expensive but also unhygienic.
We, therefore, hope that you would be kind enough to take steps to set up a canteen in the school campus for the betterment of the students.

Obediently yours,

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
31 August 2025

The Headmaster
Rangpur Zilla School
Rangpur

Subject: Application for cleaning the campus to avoid dengue menace.

Sir,
We, the students of your school, would like to draw your attention to the current situation of dengue fever in our country. Dengue fever has already got its upper hand and is rampaging across the country. Every day, we find the news of death by dengue. We all know that dengue is a mosquito-borne disease. So, the best way to prevent the disease is to control mosquito population. Unfortunately, there are lots of bushes around our school and those bushes are the ultimate habitat of the mosquitoes. Besides, in our school, there are places where water gets accumulated whenever it rains. As mosquitoes breed and grow up in water, it is a great threat to us. For this, we are at the risk of being affected by dengue.
We, therefore, humbly request you to take steps to clean the bushes around the school and remove the rain water after the rain to control the mosquito population.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Sir,
I have the honour to state that I am a student of Class X in your school. Our school library is not well-equipped. Quality books are not available here. Moreover, if a student wants to read reference books, s/he finds it difficult to find one there. The librarian cannot issue books to the students of Class X as necessary books are inadequate in the library. The SSC examinees often fail to make notes and their preparation is, thus, hampered.
Therefore, we hope that you would be kind enough to consider the problem and increase the number of quality books in the library so that the students can meet their need.

Question:

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To : headmaster.mghs@gmail.com
Subject : Application for permission to participate in relief fund raising program for the dengue affected people
Dear Sir,
With due respect I, express my gratitude to you that you have come up with a great and highly appreciable idea of raising relief fund in our school campus and the surrounding areas in order to support the dengue-affected people. Actually, such an initiative is tremendously needed now as the dengue outbreak has left many poor families helpless because of treatment cost and shrinking of income due to earning members being affected. However, I want to have the glory of being a part of this great initiative.
So, I hope you would kindly grant my application for attending the fund-raising program and thus give the opportunity to stand by the people who have fallen victims to dengue outbreak.
Yours sincerely

Write an email to the Headmaster arranging a workshop regarding the dos and donts during a fire incident.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To : headmasterroyalschool@gmail.com
Subject : Arranging a workshop regarding the dos and donts during a fire incident
Sir,
I am a student at your school and would like to request a workshop on fire safety. This workshop can teach the essential dos and donts during a fire incident. Recently, Bangladesh has experienced a number of fire accidents, such as the tragic one on February 29, 2024, at the Green Cozy Cottage Shopping Mall at Bailey Road, where 46 people lost their lives and another on December 26 at the Bangladesh Secretariat. Poor fire safety rules, unplanned urbanization, and unsafe gas and electrical systems have contributed to many of these incidents. A fire safety workshop can guide staff and students on fire alarms, evacuation routes, using fire extinguishers and identifying fire hazards. It will help everyone stay prepared and safe during emergencies.
I hope you will kindly consider this matter and arrange a workshop on fire safety concerns.
Sincerely yours,
Md. Aqib Jubair

Question:
Suppose, a lot of Dengue patients of your area are being treated at home as they are not critically ill. But these patients are not careful about the preventive measures of Dengue. They are careless about their treatment. Write an e-mail to the UNO of your upazila requesting him to form a voluntary medical team to monitor these patients regularly.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To : uno.nalchity@gmail.com
Subject : Request for forming a voluntary medical team
Dear Sir,
I am writing to request you to form a medical team to monitor Dengue patients in our area. As many of them are not critically ill, they are receiving treatment staying at home. However, they are not following preventive measures or treatment protocols. This poses a risk to their health and the community. A dedicated medical team can ensure proper care and education. It can also help to contain the Dengue outbreak.
We hope that you would be kind enough to consider the risks and take initiatives for forming a medical team to help us in this regard.
Thanking you,

Dear Sir/Madam,
I would like to inform you that I have recently witnessed some anti-social activities in my region. Some wicked boys gather around the only football ground of our area and disrupt the previously peaceful environment of our neighbourhood. They often tease school girls and try to take their photos. So I hope you will pay heed to the
situation and take swift action.
I hope that you would consider the situation and take the necessary actions.
Yours faithfully,
