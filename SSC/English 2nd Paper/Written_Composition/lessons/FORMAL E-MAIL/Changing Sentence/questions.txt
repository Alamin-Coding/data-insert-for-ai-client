Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To : headmaster.mghs@gmail.com
Subject : Application for permission to participate in relief fund raising program for the dengue affected people
Dear Sir,
With due respect I, express my gratitude to you that you have come up with a great and highly appreciable idea of raising relief fund in our school campus and the surrounding areas in order to support the dengue-affected people. Actually, such an initiative is tremendously needed now as the dengue outbreak has left many poor families helpless because of treatment cost and shrinking of income due to earning members being affected. However, I want to have the glory of being a part of this great initiative.
So, I hope you would kindly grant my application for attending the fund-raising program and thus give the opportunity to stand by the people who have fallen victims to dengue outbreak.
Yours sincerely

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To : headmasterroyalschool@gmail.com
Subject : Arranging a workshop regarding the dos and donts during a fire incident
Sir,
I am a student at your school and would like to request a workshop on fire safety. This workshop can teach the essential dos and donts during a fire incident. Recently, Bangladesh has experienced a number of fire accidents, such as the tragic one on February 29, 2024, at the Green Cozy Cottage Shopping Mall at Bailey Road, where 46 people lost their lives and another on December 26 at the Bangladesh Secretariat. Poor fire safety rules, unplanned urbanization, and unsafe gas and electrical systems have contributed to many of these incidents. A fire safety workshop can guide staff and students on fire alarms, evacuation routes, using fire extinguishers and identifying fire hazards. It will help everyone stay prepared and safe during emergencies.
I hope you will kindly consider this matter and arrange a workshop on fire safety concerns.
Sincerely yours,
Md. Aqib Jubair

They are careless about their treatment. Write an e-mail to the UNO of your upazila requesting him to form a voluntary medical team to monitor these patients regularly.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To : uno.nalchity@gmail.com
Subject : Request for forming a voluntary medical team
Dear Sir,
I am writing to request you to form a medical team to monitor Dengue patients in our area. As many of them are not critically ill, they are receiving treatment staying at home. However, they are not following preventive measures or treatment protocols. This poses a risk to their health and the community. A dedicated medical team can ensure proper care and education. It can also help to contain the Dengue outbreak.
We hope that you would be kind enough to consider the risks and take initiatives for forming a medical team to help us in this regard.
