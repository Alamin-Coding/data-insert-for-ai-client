Correct Answer: 

Solution:
12 College Road, Mymensingh
3 January 2025

Dear Limon,
I hope you are passing happy days. In your last letter, you wanted to know what I would do after my SSC Examination.
Well, I have made up my mind to go to my village then. I shall open an adult literacy centre there. I shall try my best to remove their illiteracy. I shall also make them aware of the rules of health and sanitation. Besides, I shall try to make them free from prejudices and superstitions. I would also like to make them aware of the bad effects of early marriage of their daughters and of gender disparity. I have an intention to visit Coxs Bazar as well.
No more today. Write me about your plans soon. With best regards to your parents and love to the younger ones.

Yours ever,
Helal

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
28 Subidbazar, Sylhet
27 February, 2025

Dear Maliha,
At first, take my cordial love. I hope you are doing fine. In one of the letters, you wrote that you wanted to know how I had celebrated the last 21 February in my school. Today I am writing to you about it. Every year, our teachers organize a day full of activities to commemorate the martyrs and celebrate our language, culture and history. This year was not different. With the national flag hoisted half-mast, we began our day by placing flowers at the Shaheed Minar in our school. After paying tributes, we attended the rally holding various placards and then marched around the town. Back in school, the authorities had arranged a cultural program where students sang different songs dedicated to the day, some recited poems and teachers gave a brief speech on the significance of 21 February. Around noon, there was an art competition for the students and I participated with my classmates even though I do not know how to draw.
No more today. Tell me how you celebrated your 21 February this year. Warm regards to your parents.

Your friend,
Sabina Yasmin

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
40/C Muradpur, Chattogram
23 June 2025

Dear Rana,
Hope everything is fine at your end. Today, I am going to tell you how I spent my summer vacation.
I had a summer vacation of fifteen days. So, I went to my native village with my parents to see my grandparents and uncles. I ate a lot of fresh summer fruits produced in our orchard and enjoyed the days a lot. But I was not only idling away my free time, I actually exploited my vacation in true sense. You will be glad to know that I had gathered almost 20 illiterate villagers of my village at the backyard of our house and taught them many things. My local friends and cousins also helped me in this regard. We taught them about the hygiene, sanitary latrine, population problem, early marriage, dowry, and necessity of education, female education and scientific ways of producing crops. The villagers were very pleased and thankful. They requested us to organize more such programmes in future.
No more today. Tender my regards to your honourable parents.

Yours ever,
Rupam

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
40/3 College Road, Dhaka
16 January 2025

My dear Joy,
Hope you are well by the grace of the Almighty. I have come to learn that you are not interested to go through newspapers regularly. It is very disappointing. Anyone, reading newspaper, can know many things of the world. By knowing the news and views of the world, you can use them in your practical life. Moreover, newspaper reading is a part and parcel of education. So, be serious about reading newspapers. If not, you will remain simply a book worm, and it will not help you much in your future life.
No more today. Convey my best regards to your parents.

Yours ever,

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
9, Tajmahal, Station Road, Mymensingh
10 February 2025

Dear Nahid,
It was a pleasant surprise to receive your letter a few days ago. Thank you for the card you sent me along with your letter. In your writing, you wanted to know the details about my study tour to the historical place in Sonargaon, Narayanganj.
Well, it was in the last month. The students of classes 9-10 arranged the study tour. Two of our honourable teachers supervised the whole tour. We started to gather at the school gate around 7:00 am in the morning. It was pretty cold but the sight of our tour bus made us excited. The bus started off before 8 am. Soon the breakfast was served. We reached Sonargaon by 9:30 am. It was a jaw-dropping experience when we entered the historical Panam city. We all were impressed by the serene sight. I personally felt as if we had been walking through the history book. The spooky but enchanting ancient doors of the buildings around us boggled our mind. We took many photographs. Some of the members got busy taking selfie using their smart phones. We also took group photographs. One of the most interesting aspects of the tour was a brief class lecture by our teachers while we were inspecting the architecture of the ancient buildings. We learned that those historical buildings were built centuries ago and are related with the history of Baro Bhuiyan. As the capital of the 15 century Bengal ruler Isa Khan, Sonargaon showcases the architecture of the Sultanates, Mughal and colonial periods. It was really an unforgettable experience for me.
No more today. My best wishes will always be with you. Convey my regards to your parents.

Yours ever,
Shahin

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
12 Green Road, Dhaka, Bangladesh
10 January 2025

Dear Jovan,
It's really delightful to hear from you after a long time. It makes me happy that you want to know about my country.
Let's start with the geographical position of this small country. It is a South-Asian country surrounded by India on three sides and the Bay of Bengal on the south. Myanmar lies to her south-east. Its area is 1,48,460 square kilometres where about 160 million people live. So you see the density of population in our country is high. The country achieved independence in 1971 after fighting against the well-equipped Pakistani Army for nine months. We are the only nation who has the glory of fighting for its mother language. Our Language Movement took place in 1952. Bangladesh is marked as a country of beauty. There are many places of tourist attraction in Bangladesh. We have a long cultural tradition, literature, arts, etc. that are very developed and have acquired international recognition.
The people in Bangladesh are very hard-working, ready to face any obstacles. They are very hospitable. They become very happy when they have a guest at home and try their best to entertain the guest. They like to talk a lot, even to the strangers or foreigners. People here are much curious about foreigners.
Anyway, the letter is getting long. No more today. I would like to invite you to visit my country as soon as possible. Take care.

With love,
Anuvob

Dear Anika/ Abrar,
How are you? Hope you are doing fine. I am fine, too. Today, I would like to describe a train journey that I made recently.
A few days ago, I along with my parents went to Mymensingh by train. On the day, we reached Kamalapur Railway Station very early in the morning. The station was very crowded. We boarded the train and took our seats. I chose a window seat. At 7:30 am, the train blew its whistle and started moving slowly. After a few minutes, it gained speed. Soon, we left the crowded city and entered the countryside. We were passing through the green fields. The farmers were ploughing the fields and taking care of the crops. Shepherds were grazing cattle in the fields. Children were seen playing in the field and making faces at us. Women were washing clothes and taking bath in the ponds. As the train was moving, the trees seemed running backwards. Everything was coming to sight quite fast and then disappearing even faster. The sun was trying to peep through the clouds. Indeed, the scenery was very charming. We passed by many small and big towns. The train finally reached Mymensingh at 10:30 am. Truly, it was a pleasant journey by train. I still cherish the memory of the journey in my mind.
No more today. Please, convey my greetings to aunty, uncle and your little brother Pranto.

Samia/Sayeem

Dear Nafiza,
My heartiest compliments go to you. Hope that you are hale and hearty. In your last letter, you wanted to know about the co-curricular activities of my school.
You know that I am lucky to study in such a big and famous school which offers us facilities to learn a lot of things besides studies. We can depend on our teachers not only for study matters but also for matters related to our interests. Some of them run activity clubs in school. The clubs are places where one can go and pursue his or her hobby. I am a member of the debating club. We practice debating within the club and arrange debating competitions among classes and with other schools as well. Our English teacher, who runs this club, not only guides us in writing good speeches but also shows us how to present them. Our school arranges essay competitions and book reading competitions. Moreover, my school offers a wide range of extra-curricular activities for the students. The school has a musical group and a lot of plays are staged by the students. Besides, the students enjoy hockey and football as extra-curricular activities. Teachers consult with the students at personal level and encourage them to work more and more. The students of this school learn not only for examinations but also for life. In short, studying in this school is a great experience for me.
I guess you are planning to shift to a new school. If you ask my suggestion, I will recommend my school without any hesitation.

With best wishes,
Monika

Dear Badhan,
I received your letter yesterday. It is praiseworthy that you're going well with your study. At the same time, I want to give you an advice to take physical exercise regularly. You know that &quot;A sound mind remains in a sound body&quot;. So, to keep your body fit, you should take physical exercise daily. If you avoid it, your body will get rusty. You will feel uneasy all the times. Without soundness in your body, you will become inattentive to your study. But you should become careful of the rules of exercise. Otherwise, it may hamper your health. However, you must have a proper guideline for this. I hope you will inform me your details soon.

Well, I returned home safely. But now, I am missing your company as well as your family members. Indeed, I had a very nice time with you and your family. You took much trouble for me. You accompanied me visiting different historic places of the city. I was very delighted to acquire knowledge about those attractive places. Again, I can not but remember the hospitality your family offered me. All of your family members behaved with me very well. It seemed that I was like a member of your family. Your parents treated me like their own son. Your elder sister is an amiable person. She entertained me much telling many stories and funny jokes. I wish I had an elder sister like yours.
