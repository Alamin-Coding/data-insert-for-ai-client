Subject: Application for cleaning the campus to avoid dengue menace.

Sir,
We, the students of your school, would like to draw your attention to the current situation of dengue fever in our country. Dengue fever has already got its upper hand and is rampaging across the country. Every day, we find the news of death by dengue. We all know that dengue is a mosquito-borne disease. So, the best way to prevent the disease is to control mosquito population. Unfortunately, there are lots of bushes around our school and those bushes are the ultimate habitat of the mosquitoes. Besides, in our school, there are places where water gets accumulated whenever it rains. As mosquitoes breed and grow up in water, it is a great threat to us. For this, we are at the risk of being affected by dengue.
We, therefore, humbly request you to take steps to clean the bushes around the school and remove the rain water after the rain to control the mosquito population.
