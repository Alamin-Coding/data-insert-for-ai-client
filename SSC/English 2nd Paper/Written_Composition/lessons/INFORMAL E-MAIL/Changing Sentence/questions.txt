Question:
Suppose, you are Abid/Abida, Naveed is your younger brother. You have heard that he is keeping some evil companions nowadays. Now, write an email to your younger brother advising him to avoid evil company.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To : naveed_n12@gmail.com
Subject : Advising to avoid evil company
Dear Naveed,
I hope you are hale and hearty, I am also keeping well. But I have heard that you are not keeping good company around you. It is, indeed, a bad news for me.
In your last annual exam, you did not perform well. Your marks were visibly poor. I believe the main reason for this demotion is the bad company you are keeping. The people you are having around these days are not attentive to studies. Studying hard and gaining knowledge are not their concerns. Also, some of them are heavily addicted to smoking. Some of them do not go to school regularly. If you continue mixing with them, it will affect your studies further. You will also develop bad habits like smoking, bunking off classes, being irregular in the classes, etc. So, I would request you to stay away from evil company. No more today. Keep in touch.
Your loving sister,
Abida

Question:
Suppose, you are Sabuj/Sathi living in Chattogram. You know that road accidents are now daily occurrences in our country. It takes a heavy toll of life. Now, write an email to your friend Sagor/Nadi about the causes and effects of road accidents and how to solve this problem.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To : sagor_bd@gmail.com
Subject : The causes and effects of road accidents
My dear Sagor,
Thank you for your message. Today, I like to share my concern about frequent road accidents. Road accident has become a daily occurrence in our country. The real causes of road accidents lie with the people and not with the mechanised means of transport. Reckless driving and overtaking tendency of the drivers are responsible for most of the accidents. Sometimes, they lose control over steering that leads to accidents. Violation of traffic rules by both the pedestrians and the drivers also causes road accidents. In some cities, roads are too narrow and inadequate. These can hardly cope with the ever-increasing volume of traffic. Every year, thousands of people die and many more get injured in road accidents. Sometimes, the injured have to embrace disability forever. Road accidents have become a great menace in our society. Stern steps must be taken to check this danger. Spacious roads should be constructed and traffic signals should be set up at the key points. Heavy penalty should be imposed on those who violate the traffic rules. Moreover, common people should be made aware of the traffic rules through radio, television, newspapers and posters.
Ok, I will be longing for your further text.
Your friend,
Sabuj

Academic atmosphere in the hostel is very good. Strict discipline is maintained in our hostel. The hostel superintendent looks after the administration and academic affairs properly. He loves the students very much. Everyone here is friendly and co-operative. We exchange our views regarding many affairs. There is a prayer room in the compound where we perform our religious duty regularly. The meals are delicious and healthy, too. After all, this hostel is treating me quite nicely. This is all for now.
With best regards.

To : rickyrock@gmail.com
Subject : Importance of reading newspaper
My dear Ricky,
Take my love and affection. I received your email yesterday. From your email I have learned that you don't like reading newspaper. I became really shocked knowing this. Its a great mistake of yours. Reading newspapers is one of the best habits of human beings. A newspaper is a storehouse of knowledge. By
reading newspaper, you can learn about different cultures, politics, economics, literature, sports and various things from all over the world, You can't remain ignorant of the incidents happening around you either in your country or in the world. If you keep yourself isolated; you will be proved unfit for the world. Carrying news of all the national and international events the newspaper comes to our door every morning. So, I advise you to read newspaper daily. You can learn about politics, economy, education, sports, etc. from the newspaper. It will enrich your language skill and vocabulary, as well. So, I think it is high time you changed your habit.
Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you. No more today. Stay fine.
Your loving elder sister,
Shanta

Subject : Informing the importance of physical exercise
Dear Rana,
I received your letter yesterday. It is praiseworthy that you're going well with your study. At the same time, I want to give you an advice to take physical exercise regularly. You know that &quot;A sound mind remains in a sound body.&quot; So, to keep your body fit, you should take physical exercise daily. You are already suffering from leg pain. Still you are not taking any sort of physical exercise. If you avoid doing exercise on a regular basis, your body will get rusty. You will feel uneasy all the times. Without soundness in your body, you will be inattentive to your study. But you should become careful of the rules of exercise. Otherwise, it may hamper your health. You must have a proper guideline for this. I think, you will inform me your details soon.
How're our parents? Convey my best wishes to Tuhin and Shaon. No more today.
Your elder sister,
Rubina

Subject : About a road accident I've recently witnessed
Dear Farhana,
Hope you are doing well by the grace of the Almighty. I'm not well. It's because I had a bad day a few days ago. That day, I became very nervous and shocked as I witnessed a serious road accident in our town. It happened before my eyes. A bus coming at a high speed ran over a school boy who was riding a bicycle. The
boy was badly injured and was bleeding profusely. The bus went away hurriedly. Some people took the wounded boy to a hospital nearby. I became shocked when the boy was screaming in extreme pain. Really, it was a very terrible accident! I still can not shake off the feeling. I'm writing you this for making my heart lighter by sharing the experience.
No more today. Give my regards to your parents and love to your younger brother.
Yours ever,
Ayan

Thus, try to materialize your effort and concentration.
I hope this will do. You can join me for group study.
Ok, write me soon. With the best wishes,
