Question:
Which organization is known for addressing issues related to the topic?

Options:
a. World Wildlife Fund
b. International Monetary Fund
c. World Trade Organization
d. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the subject area implied by the choices — the options include organizations dealing with environment/conservation, finance, trade, and education/culture, so the relevant topic is environmental conservation and wildlife protection.  
Step 2: Match missions to the topic: the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is an international NGO whose primary mission is wildlife conservation, biodiversity protection, and environmental sustainability, so it directly addresses this topic.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options: the International Monetary Fund (IMF) focuses on global monetary stability and finance, the World Trade Organization (WTO) deals with trade rules, and UNESCO works on education, science, and culture — none primarily target wildlife conservation.  

Therefore the correct answer is (a) World Wildlife Fund.

What is a common misconception about the topic?

Options:
a. It is only a concern for developed countries
b. It has no impact on the economy
c. It is a recent phenomenon
d. Only individuals can make a difference


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the statement — the misconception is that the issue "is only a concern for developed countries." This is common because developed countries often receive more media attention, but it is incorrect.  
Step 2: Explain why option a is wrong as a belief: many problems (e.g., climate change, pandemics, economic shocks) cross borders and affect both developed and developing nations through trade, migration, and shared environments, so the concern is global.  
Step 3: Why the other options are incorrect: option b is false because such issues do impact economies (jobs, growth, public spending); option c is false because most are long-standing rather than recent; option d is misleading because individuals help but collective, institutional, and policy actions are also required.

Question:
Which demographic is most affected by the topic?

Options:
a. Urban populations
b. Rural communities
c. Elderly citizens
d. Children and youth


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and note the given correct choice is a (Urban populations).  
Step 2: Reasoning — urban populations are typically most affected because higher population density, greater exposure to relevant risk factors (e.g., pollution, crowding, infrastructure-related problems) and more concentrated reporting make incidence or impact larger in cities.  
Step 3: Compare alternatives briefly — rural communities (b) usually have lower density and different exposure patterns; elderly (c) and children/youth (d) are age subgroups and may be highly affected in specific contexts but do not represent the overall demographic most affected across the topic.  
Therefore the correct answer is a: Urban populations.

Question:
What role do governments play in the topic?

Options:
a. Regulating industries
b. Promoting competition
c. Encouraging monopolies
d. Fostering isolationism


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Step 1: Identify the typical functions of government in an economic or policy topic — governments set rules, standards, licenses and oversight to ensure public safety, consumer protection, and orderly markets, which is described by "regulating industries."  
Step 2: Compare options: a directly states this regulatory role, so it matches exactly.  
Step 3: Explain why other choices are wrong: b (promoting competition) can be a goal of regulation but is a narrower policy objective, not the broad role named in the question; c (encouraging monopolies) contradicts usual government policy; d (fostering isolationism) is unrelated to the regulatory function.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a) Regulating industries.
