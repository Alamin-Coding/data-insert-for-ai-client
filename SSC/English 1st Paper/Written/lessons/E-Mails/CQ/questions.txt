You will be happy to know that I have already gone through all my subjects. My preparation of Bangla, English, General Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Religious Study is fairly well. Still, I have some problems in Higher Math. However, I will overcome them with the help of my teacher. I am now solving the test papers with great confidence. I contact with my teachers whenever any problem arises. My English teacher is very happy with my progress in English. I hope, your progress is also good.

Question:
Suppose, you are Abid/Abida, Naveed is your younger brother. You have heard that he is keeping some evil companions nowadays. Now, write an email to your younger brother advising him to avoid evil company.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To : naveed_n12@gmail.com

Subject : Advising to avoid evil-company

Dear Naveed,

I hope you are hale and hearty. I am also keeping well. But I have heard that you are not keeping good company around you. It is, indeed, a bad news for me.

In your last annual exam, you did not perform well. Your marks were visibly poor. I believe the main reason for this demotion is the bad company you are keeping. The people you are having around these days áre not attentive to studies. Studying hard and gaining knowledge are not their concerns. Also, some of them are heavily addicted to smoking. Some of them do not go to school regularly. If you continue mixing with them, it will affect your studies further. You will also develop bad habits like smoking, bunking off classes, being irregular in the classes, etc. So, I would request you to stay away from evil company. No more today. Keep in touch.

Your loving sister,

Abida

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To : sagor-bd@gmail.com

Subject : The causes and effects of road accidents

My dear Sagor,

Thank you for your message. Today, I like to share my concern about frequent road accidents. Road accident has become a daily occurrence in our country. The real causes of road accidents lie with the people and not with the mechanised means of transport. Reckless driving and overtaking tendency of the drivers are responsible for most of the accidents. Sometimes, they lose control over steering that leads to accidents. Violation of traffic rules by both the pedestrians and the drivers also causes road accidents. In some cities, roads are too narrow and inadequate. These can hardly cope with the ever-increasing volume of traffic. Every year, thousands of people die and many more get injured in road accidents. Sometimes, the injured have to embrace disability forever.

Road accidents have become a great menace in our society. Stern steps must be taken to check this danger. Spacious roads should be constructed and traffic signals should be set up at the key points. Heavy penalty should be imposed on those who violate the traffic rules. Moreover, common people should be made aware of the traffic rules through radio, television, newspapers and posters.

Ok, I will be longing for your further text.

Your friend,

Sabuj

Besides, computer skills can help you communicate with people from all around the world. With the internet, you can connect with anyone, anywhere. Hope this helps you understand the importance of learning computer. No more today. Convey my regards to your parents.

The email is correct because it clearly states practical benefits of learning computers—better communication, easy access to information, and improved job opportunities—so your friend understands why it matters. It explains these points with simple examples like online learning, email/phone communication, and using basic software, which shows how computers help in daily life and career. Using a friendly tone and a clear structure (greeting, reasons, encouragement, closing) makes the message relatable and persuasive for your friend in Rajshahi.

Solution:
To: rana15@gmail.com

Subject: Informing the importance of physical exercise

Dear Rana,

I received your letter yesterday. It is praiseworthy that you're going well with your study. At the same time, I want to give you an advice to take physical exercise regularly. You know that "A sound mind remains in a sound body." So, to keep your body fit, you should take physical exercise daily. You are already suffering from leg pain. Still you are not taking any sort of physical exercise. If you avoid doing exercise on a regular basis, your body will get rusty. You will feel uneasy all the times. Without soundness in your body, you will be inattentive to your study. But you should become careful of the rules of exercise. Otherwise, it may hamper your health. You must have a proper guideline for this. I think, you will inform me your details soon. How're our parents? Convey my best wishes to Tuhin and Shaon. No more today.

Your elder sister,

Rubina
