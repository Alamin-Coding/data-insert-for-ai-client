John Keats was born on October 31, 1795. He was the eldest son of his parents. He lost his father in 1804 and his mother in 1810. In 1811 Keats became an apprentice to a surgeon at Edmonton. But his heart was not in medicine and he felt that he was born to be a poet. Finally he abandoned surgery for literature. His finest poems like "Ode To a Nightingale" "Ode On a Grecian Um' etc. were published in 1820. This great poet met a premature death on February 23, 1821.

The order is chronological: (d) states his birth, (h) his being the eldest, (e) the loss of his parents, (g) his apprenticeship to a surgeon, (a) his lack of interest in medicine, (c) abandoning surgery for literature, (f) publication of his finest poems, and (b) his premature death.

Pasteur was a French scientist. He discovered that many diseases are caused by germs and he also found curses for several of them. At first, he only treated animals because he did not want to cause the death of any human being. He found a mad dog and injected some weak germs of its diseases into blood. The dog was cured. One day a boy named Joseph Meister was brought to Pasteur. He had been bitten by a mad dog Pasteur gave him some injections and the boy did not get dog's disease.

Explanation:
Correct order: e → g → (At first, he only treated animals because he did not want to cause the death of any human being) → b → a → c → d → f.  
This order first introduces Pasteur and his germ theory, then his cautious animal experiments, then his work vaccinating a mad dog and curing it, and finally the case of Joseph Meister who had been bitten and was successfully treated.  
It shows the logical cause–effect: animal tests proved the weakened-germ injections were safe, so Pasteur could use them to prevent rabies in the boy.

The underlying concept is that scientific discoveries often come from careful observation and follow-up experiments that turn an unexpected finding into a useful medical treatment.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
c+e+g+b+a+f+d+h

Once upon a time there lived a young man named Androcles. He was caught by a slave merchant who sold him to a rich man. His master was very bad and inflicted heavy torture on him. Androcles was very home-sick. One day he left from his master's house and took shelter in a cave. In the evening a lion entered the cave. The lion seemed wounded as it was groaning. It came near Androcles and lifted its paw. He took the lions paw in his hand and removed a big throne from it. The lion was relieved from its pain.

Explanation:
Solution: The correct chronological order is (c) → (g) → (e) → (b) → (a) → (f) → (d) → (h). Each sentence logically follows the previous one—Androcles lived and suffered under a cruel master, was sold, fled and hid in a cave where a wounded lion arrived, showed its injured paw, and Androcles removed the thorn, relieving its pain—so the sequence is driven by time order and clear cause–effect links.

(h) He, in stead of waking her up, stood by her bed with the glass of water in his hand.

Solution:
b + a + d + f + c + h + e + g

Explanation:
The correct order is (b) → (a) → (c) → (d) → (f) → (h) → (e) → (g) because it follows a clear chronological and causal sequence: Bayazid visits his sick mother and she asks for water but falls asleep, so he goes to the distant well, fills the pitcher and returns. He waits at her bedside with the glass (instead of waking her), she wakes some hours later and then, as he is still standing there, drinks and blesses him — the linking words “but”, “so” and “as” show these cause-and-effect steps.

One day a woman came to Buddha with her dead son. She requested Buddha to bring her dead son back to life again. Buddha realized the emotion and sorrow of the mother. He told her that if she could bring a handful of mustard seed from a house where nobody had died, her son would be alive again. The sorrowfu mother went from door to door but failed to collect the mustard seed. In every house she saw that death hat shown its cruel face. She returned to Buddha with a broken heart and told him everything. Buddha told her that death is inevitable to everybody and it was not possible to bring back her dead son's life.

Explanation:
Correct order (by the original numbering 1–8): 4 2 1 6 8 5 7 3.

This order follows the story’s cause-and-effect: the woman comes to Buddha (4), pleads for her son (2), Buddha gives the mustard-seed condition (1), she searches house to house (6) and sees death everywhere (8), returns heartbroken (5), Buddha understands her sorrow (7) and then explains that death is inevitable (3). The sequence leads naturally from the request to the lesson about the universality of death.
