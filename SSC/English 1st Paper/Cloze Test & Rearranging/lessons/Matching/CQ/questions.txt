c) The blue water and rising waves create a pleasant sight which cools our mind instantly.
d) The Saint Martin's Island which is a coral island is located in the Bay of Bengal.

For example, (a) uses "is situated" + "to the south of Bangladesh" to state location, (b) uses the defining clause "stretches for miles" before the identifying fact "is the longest sea beach," and (d) places the relative clause "which is a coral island" before the location phrase for a clear, natural sentence.
