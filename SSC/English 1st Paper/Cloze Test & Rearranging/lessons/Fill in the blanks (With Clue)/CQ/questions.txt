Question:
Read the following text and fill in each gap with a suitable the text.

Countries of the world rely heavily on petroleum, coal and natural gas for their energy sources. There are two major types of energy sources: renewable and non-renewable. Hydro-carbon or fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy. Reliance on them poses real big problems. First, fossil fuels such as oil, coal, gas, etc. are finite energy resources and the world eventually will run out of them.

Secondly, they will become too expensive in the coming decades and too damaging for the environment to repair. Thirdly, fossil fuels have direct polluting impacts on earth's environment causing global warming. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as, wind and solar energy are constantly and naturally replenished and never run out.

Most renewable energy comes either directly or indirectly from the sun. Sunlight or solar energy can be used for heating and lighting homes, for generating electricity and for other commercial and industrial uses.

Solution:
(a) More/Heavy (b) to (c) renewable (d) being (e) patterns/conditions

ক তাদের মহান করে তুলেছে তাদের পরিশ্রম, সততা এবং অন্যের জন্য দায়বোধ — তারা কঠোর পরিশ্রম করে, নৈতিকভাবে স্থির থাকে এবং পরিবার‑সমাজকে সাহায্য করে, তাই তারা গৌরবান্বিত।

খ তারা গ্রামে ফিরে এসেছে পরিবার, মাতৃভূমি বা সমাজের প্রতি দায়িত্ব পালনের জন্য; তারা শহরের সুবিধার বদলে গ্রামে কাজ করে গ্রামীন উন্নয়ন ও পরিবারকে সমর্থন করতে চায়।

গ মিস্টার মাইনুল সন্মান ও আত্মতৃপ্তি পান কারণ তিনি সৎ পরিশ্রম ও পরিমিত জীবন যাপন করেন এবং অন্যকে সাহায্য করে; এই নৈতিকতা ও সেবা‑মন তাকে শান্তি দেয়। 

ঘ মিস্টার ইসলাম বলছেন জীবনের মূলমন্ত্র হওয়া উচিত সততা, কঠোর পরিশ্রম ও মানুষের সেবা — অর্থাৎ সম্পদ না দিয়ে নিজের নৈতিকতা ও দায়িত্ব গুরুত্ব দেওয়া। 

ঙ বিষয়টি হল সাদামাটা, সৎ ও দায়বদ্ধ জীবন ও আত্মতৃপ্তির গুরুত্ব; পরিবার ও সমাজের কল্যাণকে জীবনের মূল উদ্দেশ্য হিসেবে দেখা।
