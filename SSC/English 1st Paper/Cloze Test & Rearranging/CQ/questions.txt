Help: Full Story

Sheikh Sa'di was a great persian poet. He was simple in his ways of life. Once he was invited to the emperor's palace. He set out for the emperor's palace in ordinary dress. On the way, he took shelter in a courtier's house. The courtier and his men did not show much honour and hospitality to him. On his way back home Sa'di again took shelter in the same courtier's house. This time he put on gorgeous dress.

Explanation:
Solution: The sequence follows a clear story flow: (c) introduces Sa'di, (g) states his simple life, (h) gives the invitation, then (d) he goes in ordinary dress, (a) shelters at the courtier's house, (e) the courtier is ungracious, (b) Sa'di returns, and (f) this time he wears gorgeous clothes. The contrast between his first modest appearance and his later splendid dress explains the courtier's different treatment, so the events must appear in that order.

Penicillin is a life saving medicine. It was discovered by Dr. Alexander Fleming. Fleming was born in a poor family in Scotland. He was the seventh of the eight brothers and sisters. He passed his boyhood with his parents. He was a very bright, attentive and regular student. The school was four miles away from his home. He went to school and came back home on foot.

They travelled for twelve days without any trouble. On the thirteenth day, a gang of robbers attacked them and took away all the goods and money from the merchants. Then the leader of the robbers came to Saadi and ordered him to give all he had to him. Sheikh Saadi handed him the bundle of books and also the ittle money he had without any fear, Saadi then said, "I hope that you will make the good use of these books."

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
c+e+g+b+a+f+d+h

Once upon a time there lived a young man named Androcles. He was caught by a slave merchant who sold him to a rich man. His master was very bad and inflicted heavy torture on him. Androcles was very home-sick. One day he left from his master's house and took shelter in a cave. In the evening a lion entered the cave. The lion seemed wounded as it was groaning. It came near Androcles and lifted its paw. He took the lions paw in his hand and removed a big throne from it. The lion was relieved from its pain.

Explanation:
Solution: The correct chronological order is (c) → (g) → (e) → (b) → (a) → (f) → (d) → (h). Each sentence logically follows the previous one—Androcles lived and suffered under a cruel master, was sold, fled and hid in a cave where a wounded lion arrived, showed its injured paw, and Androcles removed the thorn, relieving its pain—so the sequence is driven by time order and clear cause–effect links.

The underlying concept is that scientific discoveries often come from careful observation and follow-up experiments that turn an unexpected finding into a useful medical treatment.

Pasteur was a French scientist. He discovered that many diseases are caused by germs and he also found curses for several of them. At first, he only treated animals because he did not want to cause the death of any human being. He found a mad dog and injected some weak germs of its diseases into blood. The dog was cured. One day a boy named Joseph Meister was brought to Pasteur. He had been bitten by a mad dog Pasteur gave him some injections and the boy did not get dog's disease.

Explanation:
Correct order: e → g → (At first, he only treated animals because he did not want to cause the death of any human being) → b → a → c → d → f.  
This order first introduces Pasteur and his germ theory, then his cautious animal experiments, then his work vaccinating a mad dog and curing it, and finally the case of Joseph Meister who had been bitten and was successfully treated.  
It shows the logical cause–effect: animal tests proved the weakened-germ injections were safe, so Pasteur could use them to prevent rabies in the boy.

Help: Full Story

One day a woman came to Buddha with her dead son. She requested Buddha to bring her dead son back to life again. Buddha realized the emotion and sorrow of the mother. He told her that if she could bring a handful of mustard seed from a house where nobody had died, her son would be alive again. The sorrowfu mother went from door to door but failed to collect the mustard seed. In every house she saw that death hat shown its cruel face. She returned to Buddha with a broken heart and told him everything. Buddha told her that death is inevitable to everybody and it was not possible to bring back her dead son's life.

Explanation:
Correct order (by the original numbering 1–8): 4 2 1 6 8 5 7 3.

This order follows the story’s cause-and-effect: the woman comes to Buddha (4), pleads for her son (2), Buddha gives the mustard-seed condition (1), she searches house to house (6) and sees death everywhere (8), returns heartbroken (5), Buddha understands her sorrow (7) and then explains that death is inevitable (3). The sequence leads naturally from the request to the lesson about the universality of death.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Answer Correct Order of the Parts of the Story: (e)-(c)-(g)-(f)-(a)-(h)-(d)-(b)

Full Story:

Long, long ago, there lived a very kind and generous man in Yemen. The name of that man was Hatem Tai He was not rich but very hospitable. One day the king gave a dinner. The guests praised the king. So, the king felt happy and proud. But the guests praised Hatem Tai also. People praised him more than their king.

Explanation:
Correct order: 5, 7, 3, 6, 1, 4, 2, 8.  
This order works because sentences 5, 7 and 3 introduce the kind man and his name; sentence 6 begins the event (the king's dinner) and 1, 4, 2 show the guests' reactions (they praise the king, praise Hatem Tai too, and praise him more), and sentence 8 naturally closes with the king’s feeling.

Question:
Read the following text and fill in each gap with a suitable the text.

Countries of the world rely heavily on petroleum, coal and natural gas for their energy sources. There are two major types of energy sources: renewable and non-renewable. Hydro-carbon or fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy. Reliance on them poses real big problems. First, fossil fuels such as oil, coal, gas, etc. are finite energy resources and the world eventually will run out of them.

Secondly, they will become too expensive in the coming decades and too damaging for the environment to repair. Thirdly, fossil fuels have direct polluting impacts on earth's environment causing global warming. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as, wind and solar energy are constantly and naturally replenished and never run out.

Most renewable energy comes either directly or indirectly from the sun. Sunlight or solar energy can be used for heating and lighting homes, for generating electricity and for other commercial and industrial uses.

(a) _________ dependence on fossil fuels poses a great threat (b)___________our environment. They are not (c)__________ So, they will become very expensive beside (d)__________ the cause the long-term shifts in temperatures and weather (e) ________.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) More/Heavy (b) to (c) renewable (d) being (e) patterns/conditions

Explanation:
Answers: (a) Excessive, (b) to, (c) renewable, (d) being, (e) patterns.

Explanation: "Excessive" describes an overly large dependence; "to" is the correct preposition with "threat"; "renewable" contrasts with fossil fuels (they are non-renewable); "being" links the clause about cost with their role as a cause; and "patterns" completes the phrase "temperatures and weather patterns," referring to long-term climate changes.
