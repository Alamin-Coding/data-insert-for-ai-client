Question:
In the context of algebraic expressions, how does the concept of polynomial factorization relate to the identification of the degree of the polynomial and its leading coefficient?

Options:
a. The degree indicates the highest power of the variable, while the leading coefficient is the coefficient of that term.
b. The degree determines the number of terms in the polynomial, while the leading coefficient is irrelevant.
c. The degree affects the polynomial's ability to be factored, while the leading coefficient is always one.
d. The degree and leading coefficient have no relation in polynomial factorization.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Write a general polynomial as [math]p(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_1x+a_0[/math].  
Step 2: By definition the degree is the highest exponent, i.e. [math]n[/math], and the leading coefficient is the coefficient of that term, i.e. [math]a_n[/math].  
Step 3: Factorization does not change these facts: for example [math]2x^2+4x=2x(x+2)[math] has degree [math]2[/math] and leading coefficient [math]2[/math]; when factoring, the leading coefficient equals the product of leading coefficients of the factors.  
Therefore option a is correct. Options b, c, d are incorrect because the degree does not count terms (b), the leading coefficient need not be 1 (c), and degree and leading coefficient do play roles in factorization (d).

Question:
In which scenario does a polynomial expression become a binomial?

Options:
a. When it has two terms.
b. When it has one term.
c. When it contains a variable raised to a power of 2.
d. When it has more than two terms.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Definition — a polynomial is an expression made of one or more terms added or subtracted; a binomial specifically has exactly two terms.  
Step 2: Condition — when a polynomial has two terms (for example [math]3x + 2[/math] or [math]x^2 + 5x[/math]) it is called a binomial.  
Therefore the correct answer is option a.  
Brief note on other options: option b describes a monomial (one term), option c (a squared variable) refers to the power but not the number of terms, and option d (more than two terms) gives a trinomial or higher.

Question:
What is the significance of Pascal's triangle in relation to binomial expansions?

Options:
a. It provides the coefficients for binomial expansions.
b. It helps in solving quadratic equations.
c. It is used to calculate areas of triangles.
d. It determines the roots of polynomials.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Pascal's triangle lists binomial coefficients which are exactly the coefficients in the expansion of [math](a+b)^n[/math]; the general term is [math]\binom{n}{k}[/math], the [math]k[/math]-th entry of the [math]n[/math]-th row.  
Step 2: Examples: [math](a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2[/math] corresponds to the row [math]1,2,1[/math]; [math](a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3[/math] corresponds to [math]1,3,3,1[/math].  
Conclusion: therefore option a is correct. Options b, c, d are incorrect because Pascal's triangle does not provide methods for solving general quadratic equations, computing geometric areas, or finding polynomial roots—its role is to give binomial coefficients.
