Question:
What is the significance of a right angle in trigonometry?

Options:
a. It is used to define sine, cosine, and tangent ratios.
b. It helps in calculating the area of circles.
c. It has no importance in trigonometry.
d. It is solely related to linear equations.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
A right angle defines a right triangle which gives the hypotenuse, adjacent and opposite sides — these are needed to form the basic trigonometric ratios. Specifically, by using a right triangle we define
[math]\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}},\quad \cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}},\quad \tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}.[/math]
Thus option (a) is correct.

Briefly why the others are incorrect: (b) area of circles uses [math]A=\pi r^2[/math] and does not depend on a right angle; (c) is false because right angles are central to triangle-based trig definitions; (d) is incorrect because right angles are not solely related to linear equations.

Question:
What is the relationship between the sine and cosine of complementary angles?

Options:
a. They are equal.
b. They sum to one.
c. They multiply to one.
d. They are inversely proportional.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
The sine of an angle equals the cosine of its complementary angle, i.e. [math]\sin\theta = \cos\left(90^\circ - \theta\right)[/math] (or in radians [math]\sin\theta = \cos\left(\tfrac{\pi}{2}-\theta\right)[/math]). For example, for [math]\theta=30^\circ[/math], [math]\sin30^\circ=0.5[/math] and [math]\cos60^\circ=0.5[/math], showing equality.

Therefore the correct relationship is that they are equal (option a). Option b is incorrect because [math]\sin\theta+\cos\theta[/math] is not generally equal to 1 (only for certain angles); option c is false since [math]\sin\theta\cdot\cos\theta[/math] is not always 1; option d is also false because sine and cosine are not inversely proportional functions.
