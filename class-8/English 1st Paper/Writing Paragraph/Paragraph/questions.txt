Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Importance of PaperMost of our records in the modern age are on paper. Though writing was invented very early, paper is a more modern invention. For long in history, people transferred ideas through speaking and listening. Then there came the art of writing. But to record thoughts in writing was difficult. Writing material was not available. People used surface of stone, metal, wood, bark, leaves, etc. for writing. Those things were not easy to carry. Then for ages, people looked for easy writing materials. Finally, paper was invented in China in 105 AD. Before paper age, knowledge was very restricted. There were very few books in the world. Maybe, they were written on stone or on heavy wood plunks or on metal sheets. We can even carry a huge volume of paper encyclopedia. In fact, paper has made publication and the spread of knowledge and information easy.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A FarmerA farmer is he who earns his living by farming. Generally, a farmer lives in a village. He is usually poor. Most often he has no land of his own. So, he cultivates the land of others. He leads a very poor life. He does not get enough food to eat. He gets up early in the morning and goes to the land. He works hard on his land from dawn to dusk. Even he works in rain or sun. Most often a farmer is illiterate. He cannot apply the scientific method of cultivation. Sometimes crops fail due to natural calamities like droughts and floods. Then the misery of a farmer beggars description. The driving force of our economy is agriculture. So his contribution to our national economy is great. I like the work of a farmer very much. The government should do something to improve the condition of a farmer.

Question:
Dengue Fever

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Dengue FeverDengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the dengue virus. This virus spreads among people through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. These may include a high fever, severe headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains. There are no specific antibiotics to treat dengue fever. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive care. Paracetamol is recommended for fever reduction and pain relief. Taking sufficient rest is also important. For more severe cases, blood transfusion may be required. Aedes mosquitoes typically lay eggs near standing water in containers that hold water, like buckets, bowls, animal dishes, flower pots and vases. So the best method of preventing dengue includes destroying mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by throwing standing water and wearing thick clothes. Most importantly, everyone's awareness against dengue can halt the outbreak of this disease.

Tree Plantation

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Tree PlantationTree plantation means planting more and more trees. Trees are useful to us in many ways. We get fruits, timber and flowers from trees. Trees give us oxygen and take in carbon-dioxide. They save us from natural calamities like drought, storms, floods etc. Thus they maintain ecological balance. So trees are a valuable asset to a country. If we cut down trees at random, the country will become a desert one day. But it is unfortunate that our people are cutting trees for fuel, furniture and other purposes. We should therefore plant more trees, June and July are the best time for tree plantation. By planting trees we keep our environment balanced. Besides, we should raise awareness among all to plant more trees. We must undertake a vast project for planting trees all over the country. Thus we can make tree plantation programme a success.

Load Shedding

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Load SheddingLoad shedding means the discontinuation of supply of electricity. It happens when the generation of power is less than demand. We have fewer power plants to generate power compared to the huge demand. As a result, most often short fall of electricity occurs. So to cope with the shortage of power generation, the flow of electricity of some areas is stopped for some time. This results in load-shedding. Load-shedding causes a great harm to the socio-economic development of a country. Mills-factories, shops, hospitals etc are affected by it. Production is hampered owing to it. Students, housewives, patients fall a victim to load-shedding. As load-shedding causes great sufferings to the people and irreparable loss to the economy, it should not be continued.

On a rainy day man cannot go out for normal activities. Those who have urgent works go out with umberlla over the head, shoes in hand and clothes folded upto knee. The poor people and day labourers become jobless. So they cannot earn their livelihood. School going boys and girlsenjoy a rainy day because they do not go to school. Even if a few go to school, classes are not held. So they pass the day by gossiping. The domestic animals keep standing in their sheds and bellow for fodder. The rich eat delicious items of food and pass the day sitting before television. On a whole a rainy day means different to different people.

A Street Accident

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A Street AccidentGenerally street accidents take place in the urban areas and in the highways. The causes of street accidents are reckless driving, brake failure, overtaking, driving by unskilled drivers and violation of traffic rules. However, recently I witnessed a terrible street accident at Farmgate in Dhaka. A rickshaw puller was pulling two college girls to Farmgate. At that time, a driver of a pick-up van pushed back the rickshaw. Then and there the two girls were run over by the van. They were spot dead. But the rickshaw puller escaped narrowly. The road was covered with blood. Street accidentcan be prevented by all out efforts from both the authorities and the general mass. To do so, first our general people will have to be made aware of traffic rules. The drivers will have to be skilled. Unskilled drivers should not be given any license. And the authorities should be more strict to enforce the traffic rules. If anyone violates traffic rules, he/she should be given exemplary punishment.
