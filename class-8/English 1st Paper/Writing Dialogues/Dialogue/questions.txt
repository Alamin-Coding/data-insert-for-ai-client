Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Myself : Hey Neeloy, did you see how big the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement has become? It's no longer just students-people from all walks of life are joining in!Neeloy : Yeah, I noticed that too. It started with students demanding a merit-based system instead of the quota system. Butnow it's transformed into something bigger, with people calling for major political change.Myself : Exactly. I think people are just fed upwith the systemic inequality and lack of fairness. The quota system was only the tip of the iceberg, but it's clear there are so many more issues people want addressed.Neeloy : And it's incredible how this movementgained momentum so quickly. When it began, I didn't expect it to lead to demands for the government to step down. But I guess it reflects how much frustration has built up over the years.Myself : Definitely. The government's rigidstance and lack of response have only fueled people's anger. Seeing students lead this fight for a fairer system really inspired others to join in, and now it's like the whole nation is demanding change.Neeloy :It's powerful, isn't it?Myself : Absolutely. And I think it also bringshope for the future. When a movement can start with just students pushing for academic fairness and evolve to address national issues, it shows that people want and believe in change.Neeloy : True, this is a pivotal moment for Bangladesh. It's like people are realizing their power to hold the government accountable and demand a fairer society. Let's hope this unity leads to real transformation.Myself : I agree. This could be a historic turning point, with people standing together for justice and equality:
