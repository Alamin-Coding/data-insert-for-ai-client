We, the inhabitants of Nurpur Village of your union parishad, have the honour to draw your attention to the fact that we have no scope to drink arsenic-free water in our village.

Still it is causing much harm to the health of the inhabitants of this village.
In these circumstances, it is hoped that you would be kind enough to sink a deep tube-well in our village and keep the villagers away from probable danger.
