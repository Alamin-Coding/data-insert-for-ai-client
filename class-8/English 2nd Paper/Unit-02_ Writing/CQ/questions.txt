Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Corruption in Society}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Corruption is a serious disease in society. It means dishonest or illegal behavior, especially by powerful people like government officials, politicians, or businessmen. Corruption destroys the development of a nation, creates injustice, and spreads inequality.[math]\textbf{Forms of Corruption:}[/math]
 Bribery, nepotism, tax evasion, misuse of public funds, and cheating are common types of corruption. In many cases, people have to pay extra money to get jobs, licenses, or services that should be free or fair. It also happens in courts, police, hospitals, and schools.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 The main causes of corruption are greed, lack of transparency, weak law enforcement, political influence, and poverty. When people see that corrupt people are not punished, they lose faith in justice and become corrupt themselves.[math]\textbf{Effects on Society:}[/math]
 Corruption makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. It stops good people from getting opportunities. Roads, schools, and hospitals remain poor in quality because of fund theft. It leads to frustration, crime, and public anger. The whole society suffers.[math]\textbf{Ways to Stop Corruption:}[/math]
 Strong laws and punishments are needed. Digital systems and automation can reduce human contact and corruption. People must be educated to be honest. Media and civil society should raise their voice. Whistleblowers must be protected.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Corruption is a curse that destroys both individuals and nations. If we want a just and developed country, we must fight against corruption together. Honesty should be taught at home and school.

Explanation:
The composition should define "corruption," describe its root causes, explain its social and economic effects, give concrete examples, and propose practical solutions; this structure is correct because it informs the reader, analyzes the problem, and offers remedies in a balanced way. Using clear topic sentences, relevant supporting details, and a concise conclusion keeps the essay coherent and helps you cover all essential points within 250 words. Simple language, specific instances, and actionable measures (laws, transparency, civic education) make the piece persuasive and educational.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Deforestation and Its Effects}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Deforestation and Its Effects}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Deforestation means cutting down trees and destroying forests. It is one of the biggest threats to nature and human survival. In Bangladesh, forests are disappearing rapidly due to overpopulation, urbanization, and industrial needs.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 People cut trees for fuel, farming, furniture, and construction. Forests are cleared for roads, buildings, and factories. Illegal logging and forest fires also cause destruction. Many don’t realize the long-term effects.[math]\textbf{Effects:}[/math]
 Deforestation leads to soil erosion, loss of wildlife, and climate change. It reduces rainfall and increases temperature. Rivers dry up, and natural disasters like floods and droughts become common. Animals lose their homes, and biodiversity is damaged. It also affects air quality and health.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 We must plant trees regularly. Deforested lands should be reforested. Alternative fuels should be used to reduce tree cutting. Forest laws must be enforced strictly. People should be educated on the value of trees.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Trees are our natural friends. If forests die, life on Earth will become impossible. We must protect forests for ourselves and future generations. Deforestation must stop now.

Explanation:
Deforestation, the large-scale removal of trees and conversion of forested land to non-forest uses, poses one of the most pressing environmental challenges today. Forests regulate climate by storing carbon, maintain biodiversity by providing habitat for countless species, and support the livelihoods of millions through resources like timber, food, and medicine. When trees are cleared for agriculture, logging, mining, or urban expansion, stored carbon is released as greenhouse gases, intensifying global warming. Loss of forest cover also disrupts the water cycle: reduced transpiration can alter rainfall patterns, increase soil erosion, and diminish water quality, harming both ecosystems and human communities. Biodiversity suffers as specialist species lose habitat and face increased risk of extinction; this weakens ecosystem services such as pollination and pest control that underpin agriculture and food security. Socially and economically, indigenous and rural communities dependent on forests lose cultural ties and sources of sustenance, while economies face long-term costs from degraded land and reduced ecosystem services. Addressing deforestation requires integrated solutions: enforcing sustainable land-use policies, promoting reforestation and afforestation, supporting agroforestry and sustainable agriculture, and ensuring fair land rights for local communities. International cooperation and consumer choices—such as reducing demand for products linked to forest clearing—also play critical roles. By valuing forests beyond short-term profit and implementing science-based conservation strategies, societies can protect biodiversity, stabilize climate, and secure resources for future generations. Education, funding for protected areas, and monitoring with technology like satellite imagery further enable enforcement and restoration, ensuring globally forests provide essential benefits to people and nature.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Discipline}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Discipline}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Discipline means following rules and being orderly in everything we do. It helps us live a good and meaningful life. Without discipline, life becomes chaotic and unproductive. It is needed in every part of life — in school, home, office, and even on the road.[math]\textbf{Importance in Student Life:}[/math]
 A student must have discipline to succeed. Attending school on time, doing homework regularly, listening to teachers, and respecting others are all parts of student discipline. A disciplined student can become a successful person in the future.[math]\textbf{In Family and Society:}[/math]
 Discipline in the family creates peace and understanding. If everyone behaves properly, there are fewer conflicts. In society, discipline ensures law and order. If citizens obey rules, there is peace and progress.[math]\textbf{In National Life:}[/math]
 A disciplined nation is a developed nation. Workers, officers, leaders — all must follow discipline to build a strong country. The army is an example of strict discipline.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Discipline is the key to success and peace. It makes a person responsible, honest, and respectful. We must learn and practice discipline from an early age to become good human beings.

Explanation:
Discipline is the habit of following rules, routines, and self-imposed standards to achieve goals and maintain order. It begins with clear purpose: when a person knows what they want, discipline provides the steady momentum to reach it. Self-discipline means controlling impulses, managing time, and prioritizing important tasks over short-term pleasures. External discipline, such as school rules or workplace policies, creates a safe and predictable environment where people can cooperate and learn.

To develop discipline, one should set realistic goals, break them into small steps, and create consistent routines. Regular practice, timely feedback, and adjusting strategies when needed help turn effort into habit. Tools like planners, reminders, and accountability partners support persistence. Discipline is not harshness or blind obedience; it is a balanced choice that respects personal well-being while encouraging responsibility.

The benefits of discipline appear in many areas of life: academic success, professional reliability, physical health through regular exercise, and stronger relationships built on trust. Disciplined people are generally better at handling stress because routines reduce uncertainty and conserve mental energy for important decisions. Moreover, discipline fosters self-respect and earns respect from others.

Ultimately, discipline is a skill that can be learned and refined. It empowers individuals to transform intentions into actions and to keep going when motivation wanes. By practicing small, consistent behaviors and reflecting on progress, anyone can strengthen their discipline and build a more productive, balanced life.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Floods in Bangladesh}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Bangladesh is one of the most flood-prone countries in the world. Its geographical position, numerous rivers, and monsoon climate make it vulnerable to frequent floods. Although floods are natural, their impact on people and the economy can be devastating.[math]\textbf{Causes of Flood:}[/math]
 Heavy rainfall during the monsoon is the main cause of floods. Overflowing of rivers like Padma, Jamuna, and Brahmaputra submerges vast areas. Melting of Himalayan glaciers increases river water levels. Poor drainage in urban areas and deforestation make floods worse.[math]\textbf{Effects of Floods:}[/math]
 Floods damage crops, houses, roads, schools, and hospitals. Many people become homeless and have to take shelter in flood centers. Food and drinking water become scarce. Diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and skin infections spread easily. Educational activities are interrupted for weeks.[math]\textbf{Impact on Economy and Society:}[/math]
 Farmers suffer the most because their crops are washed away. Transportation stops, and business activities decline. Relief work becomes expensive and often delays. The country’s GDP is affected by repeated flood losses.[math]\textbf{Relief and Response:}[/math]
 The government and NGOs try to provide relief by supplying food, clean water, medicine, and shelter. Volunteers and local people also help flood victims. Boats and helicopters are used for rescue. Early warning systems are improving, but much more needs to be done.[math]\textbf{Prevention and }[/math]
 Building embankments, dredging rivers, planting trees, and improving drainage can reduce flood damage. Public awareness and community training are essential. Scientific forecasting systems must be upgraded.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 We cannot stop floods, but we can reduce their damage. Proper planning, strong infrastructure, and public cooperation can make Bangladesh more flood-resilient.

Explanation:
This 250-word composition correctly treats [math]\textbf{Floods in Bangladesh}[/math] by succinctly outlining the main causes (intense monsoon rains, upstream river discharge, siltation and low-lying deltaic topography), the key impacts (loss of life, damage to homes and crops, health and economic problems) and practical mitigation measures (embankments, early warning systems, shelters, flood-resilient farming and long-term river management). Its clear structure—brief introduction, focused paragraphs on causes, effects and solutions, and a concluding call for awareness and planning—ensures coherence and covers essential points that students must learn. Simple language and concrete examples make the topic accessible while stressing both immediate preparedness and the need for sustainable policies.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Food Adulteration}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Food adulteration is a crime against health and humanity. It means mixing harmful chemicals or low-quality substances with food to increase quantity or shelf life. This has become a serious issue in Bangladesh, especially in cities and markets.[math]\textbf{Common Types:}[/math]
 Many foods are adulterated. Formalin is used in fish and fruits, calcium carbide in mangoes, textile dye in turmeric powder, and soap in sweets. Milk is mixed with water or detergent. These chemicals are highly toxic and dangerous for health.[math]\textbf{Reasons:}[/math]
 Dishonest traders do this to earn more money. Lack of proper monitoring and weak punishment also encourage this practice. People often cannot identify adulterated food, and there is no proper labeling system.[math]\textbf{Health Hazards:}[/math]
 Adulterated food causes cancer, kidney failure, diarrhea, ulcers, and even death. Children suffer from poor growth, and pregnant women face complications. Long-term consumption damages the body silently.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 The government must take strict action. Mobile courts, fines, and jail sentences must be applied regularly. People should be aware and check labels and sources. Scientific labs should test food samples. Media and schools should teach about food safety.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Food is life. Adulterating it is like poisoning society. We must say “no” to food adulteration and build a healthy nation with honesty and responsibility.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Gender Equality in Education}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Gender Equality in Education}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Gender equality in education means giving boys and girls equal rights and opportunities to study, grow, and succeed. In many parts of the world, especially in developing countries like Bangladesh, girls have historically faced more challenges in accessing education. But without gender equality, true development is not possible.[math]\textbf{Why It Matters:}[/math]
 When girls are educated, they become healthier, economically stronger, and more confident. They can support their families, raise better-educated children, and take leadership roles in society. Boys and girls must be treated equally in schools, colleges, and society. Education is a right, not a privilege based on gender.[math]\textbf{Current Situation in Bangladesh:}[/math]
 In recent years, Bangladesh has made progress. Girls now outnumber boys in many schools. Government programs like stipends and free books have helped improve girls’ attendance. Female teachers are encouraged, and awareness is rising. However, in rural areas, early marriage, poverty, and family restrictions still prevent many girls from continuing their education.[math]\textbf{Challenges:}[/math]
 Girls often face harassment on the way to school, lack of toilets, and unsafe environments. Some families still believe that girls do not need higher education. These social attitudes must change.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 More schools should be built closer to homes. Safety must be ensured. Parents need awareness. Laws against early marriage and gender discrimination should be strictly enforced. Both boys and girls should learn to respect each other.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Gender equality in education is essential for a fair, successful, and developed society. Let us ensure every child, regardless of gender, gets equal chance to learn and lead.

Explanation:
This explanation is correct because it shows what a good 250‑word composition must include: a clear definition of gender equality in education, its importance, common barriers, and practical solutions. It helps students by outlining the underlying concept—equal access and outcomes lead to social justice, economic benefits, and personal development—and by suggesting they use concise examples and policy measures. Focus on those elements when writing to keep the essay balanced, informative, and within the word limit.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Global Warming and Climate Change}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Global Warming and Climate Change}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Global warming and climate change are two of the most serious environmental issues in today’s world. Global warming refers to the rise in Earth’s average temperature due to the increase of greenhouse gases. Climate change includes global warming and its broader effects like droughts, floods, and sea-level rise.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 Burning fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil), deforestation, and industrial emissions are the major causes of global warming. These activities release carbon dioxide, methane, and other harmful gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Cutting down trees reduces the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide.[math]\textbf{Effects:}[/math]
 The Earth is getting hotter every year. Polar ice is melting, causing sea levels to rise. This leads to flooding in coastal areas. There are more droughts, heatwaves, and storms. Agriculture is being affected, and many species are becoming extinct. Bangladesh, being a low-lying country, is at high risk.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 We must reduce carbon emissions by using renewable energy like solar and wind power. Planting more trees, reducing plastic use, and recycling can help. Governments must take global steps, like following the Paris Agreement. People must also be aware and make eco-friendly choices.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Global warming is a threat to life on Earth. We must act now before it is too late. Protecting the environment is not only the duty of the government but also of every citizen.

Explanation:
A 250‑word composition on [math]\textbf{Global Warming and Climate Change}[/math] is correct when it clearly links the rise in global average temperatures to increased greenhouse gas concentrations and then explains how those temperature changes lead to longer‑term shifts in climate patterns. The underlying concept is the greenhouse effect: gases like carbon dioxide and methane trap outgoing heat, and human activities (burning fossil fuels, deforestation) have raised their levels, causing warming and more extreme weather. A strong short composition should therefore state the causes, give key observable effects (heatwaves, sea‑level rise, altered rainfall, biodiversity loss) and outline basic solutions (reduce emissions, switch to renewables, protect forests, adapt communities) so readers grasp both the problem and practical responses.

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Graffiti: Art as Protest in the July Revolution}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Graffiti is a form of street art made on public surfaces like walls, buildings, or roads. It is not just art for beauty but often used as a powerful medium to express strong emotions, political opinions, and social messages.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Load Shedding}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Load Shedding}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Load shedding means the temporary stopping of electricity in different areas. It is a common problem in Bangladesh, especially during the summer. It creates serious problems in homes, schools, offices, and hospitals.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 The main cause is the shortage of electricity production. Other causes include misuse of electricity, old equipment, and poor management. When demand is more than supply, the authority cuts off power to manage the load.[math]\textbf{Effects:}[/math]
 Students cannot study properly. Business and industries face losses. Hospitals suffer during emergency treatments. Food gets spoiled. People sweat in the heat without fans or ACs. Internet and mobile networks also stop working.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 We should use electricity wisely. Government should invest in solar and wind power. Corruption and theft in the power sector must stop. Awareness programs can help people save power.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Load shedding is harmful for national progress. Everyone should help save electricity. Only then can we enjoy an uninterrupted life.

Explanation:
Load shedding—planned interruption of electrical supply—has become a common problem in many developing countries. It occurs when demand for electricity exceeds the available generation capacity or when transmission and distribution systems face technical faults. Frequent load shedding disrupts daily life, harms industries, interrupts education, and affects healthcare services that rely on continuous power. Small businesses lose perishable goods, and manufacturing lines face costly downtime. Households experience inconvenience and increased reliance on expensive backup sources like diesel generators, which raise pollution and fuel expenses.

The causes include insufficient generation investment, aging infrastructure, fuel shortages, transmission losses, and poor grid management. Seasonal factors such as extreme heat can spike demand for cooling, worsening shortages. To mitigate load shedding, governments and utilities must adopt a mix of short- and long-term measures: improve demand forecasting, invest in new generation (including renewable energy), upgrade transmission networks, reduce technical losses, and implement fair load management schemes. Promoting energy efficiency in buildings, appliances, and industries helps lower peak demand, while time-of-use tariffs encourage consumers to shift consumption to off-peak hours.

Community-level solutions include distributed generation like rooftop solar, battery storage, and microgrids that increase resilience. Public awareness campaigns about conservation are crucial. Ultimately, ending chronic load shedding requires coordinated policy, infrastructure investment, and behavioral change to balance supply and demand sustainably, support economic growth, and improve quality of life for citizens. Short-term relief like scheduled rotations must be fair and communicated clearly, while long-term planning secures reliable power for future generations and reduces social unrest significantly overall.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{A Visit to a Historical Place }[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Visiting historical places is always educational and exciting. It helps us connect with our past and understand our heritage. Last month, I had the opportunity to visit Lalbagh Fort, one of the most famous historical landmarks in Dhaka, Bangladesh.[math]\textbf{Location and History:}[/math]
 Lalbagh Fort is located in the old part of Dhaka city. It was built in 1678 during the Mughal period by Prince Muhammad Azam, the son of Emperor Aurangzeb. Though it was never completed, the fort remains a symbol of Mughal architecture and history. It holds stories of love, war, and incomplete dreams.[math]\textbf{What I Saw:}[/math]
 The fort is surrounded by high walls. Inside, there are several important buildings such as the Tomb of Pari Bibi, the mosque, and the audience hall. The gardens are beautifully maintained.

 Walking through the fort, I felt like I had traveled back in time. It made me think about the lives of kings, queens, and common people during the Mughal rule. I realized how rich our culture and history are.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Anti-discrimination Student Movement}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 The Anti-discrimination Student Movement was one of the biggest student-led protests in Bangladesh in recent times. It happened in July 2024 and started because students were unhappy about the unfair job quota system announced by the government.[math]\textbf{The Cause of Protest:}[/math]
 In June 2024, the High Court of Bangladesh declared a 30% quota for children of freedom fighters in government jobs. However, there were already quotas for other groups. As a result, only 44% of jobs remained open for general applicants. Students believed this system was unjust and demanded a fair distribution of opportunities.[math]\textbf{Historical Background:}[/math]
 This protest was not new. Students had previously protested against quota systems in 2013 and 2018. Those movements created awareness, but in 2024, the issue became more serious and widespread.[math]\textbf{Nature of the Protest:}[/math]
 Students across the country took to the streets. They blocked major roads and organized sit-ins. On July 15, the protest turned violent when armed individuals attacked students. Many were injured. Yet, the protests grew stronger. Social media helped spread the movement quickly.[math]\textbf{Demand and Result:}[/math]
 On August 3, students declared that the government must resign. Their demand was bold, but it showed their frustration. They wanted fairness, not privilege based on birth. The protest was about equality, merit, and justice.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 The Anti-discrimination Student Movement was a powerful example of student unity and courage. It reminded the nation that youth will rise against injustice. The movement has made a permanent mark on Bangladesh’s political and social history.

Explanation:
The correct composition clearly defines the Anti-discrimination Student Movement by stating its purpose, causes, and goals, which gives the reader a focused understanding of the topic. It follows a concise structure—introduction, body with examples and student roles, and a conclusion with a call to action—so the main points fit logically into 250 words. Including concrete examples, peaceful strategies, and expected outcomes shows how the movement works in practice and why student participation matters.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Child Labour in Bangladesh}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Child labour is a serious social and economic problem in Bangladesh. It means engaging children in jobs that are harmful to their physical and mental growth. Millions of children in our country work in factories, hotels, shops, and households to support their families.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 The main causes of child labour are poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, and lack of awareness. Many parents are so poor that they send their children to work instead of sending them to school. Employers prefer children because they can be paid less and forced to work long hours.[math]\textbf{Types of Work:}[/math]
 Child labourers in Bangladesh work in garment factories, brickfields, tea stalls, and as domestic workers. Some even work in dangerous places like chemical industries and construction sites. They often face abuse, low wages, and health problems.[math]\textbf{Effects:}[/math]
 Child labour deprives children of education and a proper childhood. It keeps them in a cycle of poverty. They grow up with poor health, lack of skills, and low self-esteem. This creates an unskilled and weak future generation for the country.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 The government must enforce child labour laws strictly. Free and compulsory education must be ensured. Parents must be given support and jobs so that they don’t need to send their children to work. NGOs and media should create awareness.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Child labour is a national shame. Every child deserves education, care, and protection. We all must work together to eliminate child labour and build a better future for our children.

The underlying concept is to use a respectful tone, give a clear reason and date, and make a direct but courteous request so the authority can grant permission. Include a proper salutation, a brief body stating the purpose, and a closing with your name, class, and signature.

Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Physical Exercise}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Physical Exercise}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Physical exercise means the regular movement of body parts. It is essential for good health. Just as food is necessary for our body, exercise is also needed to keep us active and strong.[math]\textbf{Types of Exercise:}[/math]
 There are many kinds of physical exercise — walking, running, swimming, cycling, skipping, and yoga. Games like football, cricket, and badminton are also good forms of exercise. People of all ages should choose exercises according to their strength and age.[math]\textbf{Importance of Exercise:}[/math]
 Physical exercise keeps our body fit, increases blood circulation, and improves our immune system. It makes us energetic and helps us concentrate better in studies. A person who exercises regularly remains fresh and cheerful.[math]\textbf{Best Time and Place:}[/math]
 Early morning is the best time for exercise because the air is clean and cool. Open spaces like parks, gardens, and fields are suitable places. Fresh air adds to the benefits.[math]\textbf{Mental and Social Value:}[/math]
 Exercise also improves our mood and reduces stress. It helps us socialize, build friendships, and learn discipline through sports.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 A healthy mind lives in a healthy body. Without exercise, we cannot enjoy life fully. So, everyone should do some form of physical activity daily to stay fit and happy.

Explanation:
Physical exercise is an essential part of a healthy life. Regular physical activity strengthens the heart, muscles and bones, improves flexibility, and helps control weight. It also boosts mood by releasing endorphins, reduces stress, and improves sleep. People who exercise regularly lower their risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. Exercise also enhances mental sharpness, concentration and self-confidence.

There are many types of physical exercise to suit different ages and abilities. Aerobic activities like walking, jogging, cycling and swimming improve cardiovascular fitness. Strength training using weights or resistance bands builds muscle mass and bone density. Flexibility exercises such as stretching and yoga increase range of motion and prevent injuries. Balance exercises are especially important for older adults to reduce the risk of falls. A well-rounded routine includes a mix of aerobic, strength, flexibility and balance work.

To get the best results, consistency and gradual progress are key. Beginners should start with moderate activity, set realistic goals, and increase intensity or duration slowly. Warming up before exercise and cooling down afterwards help prevent soreness and injury. Proper technique, comfortable clothing and hydration are also important. It is wise to consult a doctor before starting a new program, especially for people with health conditions.

In short, physical exercise supports overall health and quality of life. By making it a regular habit, individuals gain physical strength, mental clarity and long-term disease protection. Small daily efforts add up, so choose activities you enjoy and stick with them consistently always.

This composition is correct because it covers the core concept: benefits, types, safety and practical tips for exercise. It helps students understand why exercise matters and how to start safely, using clear, simple points they can apply.

Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Population Problem in Bangladesh}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Population Problem in Bangladesh}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. With over 170 million people living in a small area, the country is facing serious population-related challenges. This problem affects almost every aspect of life — from food and housing to education and employment.[math]\textbf{Reasons for Overpopulation:}[/math]
 Lack of awareness about family planning, early marriage, poverty, and low literacy rates are the main reasons for overpopulation. In rural areas, people often think more children mean more help in work. Many families are unaware of the economic and social burden caused by large families.[math]\textbf{Effects of Overpopulation:}[/math]
 Overpopulation creates a huge strain on food, water, land, education, and healthcare. Schools become overcrowded, and hospitals cannot treat all patients properly. Unemployment rises, and crime rates increase. Urban areas suffer from traffic jams, pollution, and housing crises.[math]\textbf{Impact on Development:}[/math]
 Rapid population growth makes it difficult to provide quality education and job opportunities. It slows down economic progress. Resources that could be used for development are instead spent on basic needs like food and shelter. Government services become insufficient.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 The only way to solve this problem is through strong family planning programs, public awareness campaigns, and compulsory education for girls. Delaying marriage and promoting one or two-child families can help control growth. Religious leaders, teachers, and media can also spread awareness.[math]\textbf{Government Role:}[/math]
 The government should ensure availability of free birth control services, provide incentives for small families, and punish false registration or misuse of welfare schemes.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Population is both a strength and a challenge. If managed well, it can become a national asset. But if it continues to grow unchecked, it can destroy progress. We must act now to save our future.

Explanation:
A strong 250-word composition on the population problem in Bangladesh should briefly define the issue, present key causes (high fertility, poverty, early marriage, rural-to-urban migration), outline major impacts (pressure on housing, education, health, environment, unemployment) and propose realistic solutions (family planning, female education, economic opportunities, decentralisation). This structure is “correct” because it balances description, analysis, and remedy within the word limit, showing understanding rather than just listing facts. To write it well, use simple clear sentences, one or two short paragraphs for causes and effects, a concise paragraph for solutions, and include one concrete statistic or example to make the argument credible.

Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Price Hike in Bangladesh}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Price Hike in Bangladesh}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Price hike means the continuous rise in the prices of daily necessities. In recent years, it has become a major problem in Bangladesh. It affects every class of people, especially the poor and middle-income families. The rising prices of food, fuel, and transportation are making life harder day by day.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 There are many reasons behind price hike. Some of them are natural disasters like floods or droughts that damage crops. Others include hoarding by dishonest traders, increased fuel prices, import taxes, transportation costs, and global market changes. Political instability and corruption also add to the problem.[math]\textbf{Effects:}[/math]
 Price hike creates great suffering. Poor people cannot afford proper food or medicine. Many families are forced to reduce meals or borrow money. Students drop out of school because of financial pressure. Crimes like theft and cheating increase when people become desperate.[math]\textbf{Impact on Society:}[/math]
 Price hike increases inequality. The rich get richer, but the poor get poorer. The middle class is disappearing. Social unrest, frustration, and protests become more common. It also damages trust in markets and government policies.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 The government must monitor markets regularly. Hoarders and corrupt traders should be punished. Subsidies should be given on food, medicine, and fuel. Encouraging local production and reducing dependency on imports will help stabilize prices.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Price hike is a threat to peace and development. It must be controlled with strong action, honest leadership, and public cooperation. Only then can people live with hope and dignity.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Renewable Energy for a Sustainable Future}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Renewable Energy for a Sustainable Future}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Renewable energy means energy from natural sources like the sun, wind, water, and biomass that do not run out. It is clean, safe, and environmentally friendly. In the face of climate change and energy crisis, renewable energy is the only path to a sustainable and secure future.[math]\textbf{Types of Renewable Energy:}[/math]
 The main types are solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and biomass energy. These sources are naturally replenished and do not pollute the environment. Solar panels collect sunlight, wind turbines use wind, and dams produce electricity from flowing water.[math]\textbf{Importance:}[/math]
 Fossil fuels like coal and oil are limited and harmful to the environment. They cause pollution, global warming, and health issues. Renewable energy reduces carbon emissions, slows down climate change, and keeps the air clean. It also creates green jobs and makes countries energy-independent.[math]\textbf{Renewable Energy in Bangladesh:}[/math]
 Bangladesh has good potential for solar and wind energy. Many schools and homes in rural areas now use solar panels. The government is promoting “Green Energy” through different projects. Off-grid solar systems have brought electricity to remote villages.[math]\textbf{Challenges:}[/math]
 High initial costs, lack of technology, and lack of skilled manpower are the main barriers. People also lack awareness of the long-term benefits. More investment, training, and research are needed.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Renewable energy is not just a choice — it is a necessity. For a clean, healthy, and sustainable world, we must shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Every step toward green energy is a step toward saving the planet.

Explanation:
A 250-word composition on "Renewable Energy for a Sustainable Future" is appropriate because it explains why shifting from fossil fuels to renewable sources is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect ecosystems, and ensure long-term energy security. The underlying concept is that renewables—such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass—are naturally replenished and produce far fewer pollutants, so widespread adoption combined with efficiency, storage, and policy support leads to a sustainable energy system. Students should take away that technical solutions (clean technologies, grids, storage) plus social and policy changes (investment, incentives, conservation) together enable a just transition that creates jobs, improves public health, and stabilizes the climate.

 Road safety is a major concern in Bangladesh. Every year, thousands of people die or get injured in road accidents. Most of these accidents can be avoided if people follow traffic rules and drive responsibly.[math]\textbf{Causes of Accidents:}[/math]
 The main causes of road accidents are reckless driving, speeding, overloading, unfit vehicles, drunk driving, and breaking traffic rules. Inexperienced drivers and poor road conditions also add to the problem.[math]\textbf{Importance of Awareness:}[/math]
 If people are aware, many lives can be saved. Wearing helmets, using seatbelts, not using phones while driving, and obeying traffic signals are basic safety rules. Pedestrians should also use footpaths and zebra crossings.[math]\textbf{Role of Government and Society:}[/math]
 The government should strictly punish traffic rule violators and ensure better road design. Schools should teach road safety. Awareness campaigns, TV ads, posters, and social media can spread safety messages.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Road safety is everyone’s responsibility. With awareness and discipline, accidents can be reduced. Let us all follow the rules and save lives.

Explanation:
The composition is correct because it clearly states the importance of road safety, outlines common risks (like speeding, drunk or distracted driving), and gives practical preventive measures (obeying signs, using seat belts and helmets, and pedestrian caution). Its organized structure—short introduction, focused body with causes and rules, and a concluding call to responsibility—helps readers follow and remember key points. This teaches the underlying concept that road safety depends on awareness, lawful behavior, and shared responsibility, and that following simple rules reduces accidents and saves lives.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Social Media}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Social media is a modern communication tool that allows people to share information, photos, and videos instantly. Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Twitter are popular platforms. It has changed how people connect, learn, and express themselves.[math]\textbf{Advantages:}[/math]
 Social media helps us stay in touch with friends and family. Students use it for online learning. News spreads quickly. Businesses promote products. Creative people share art, music, and ideas globally.[math]\textbf{Disadvantages:}[/math]
 However, there are risks. Excessive use leads to addiction, depression, and poor sleep. False news spreads fast. People waste time. Personal data can be stolen. Children may face cyberbullying.[math]\textbf{Using Wisely:}[/math]
 We should use social media with caution. Set time limits. Verify information before sharing. Avoid harmful content. Parents should guide children’s use.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Social media is a powerful tool. It can help or harm, depending on how we use it. We must be smart users and use it for learning and positive change.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{The Impact of COVID-19 on Education}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Impact of COVID-19 on Education}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 The COVID-19 pandemic affected every part of life across the world. One of the sectors hit hardest was education. Schools, colleges, and universities were closed for months. Students, teachers, and parents faced an entirely new way of learning. In Bangladesh, the impact was even more serious because of limited digital access.[math]\textbf{Closure of Institutions:}[/math]
 Educational institutions were closed for over a year. Board exams were delayed or canceled. Millions of students lost connection with formal learning. Children in rural areas suffered the most due to lack of smartphones, internet, or even electricity.[math]\textbf{Online Education:}[/math]
 During the pandemic, online classes became the new normal. Platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and YouTube were used. However, not all students could attend regularly. Network issues, lack of devices, and poor digital literacy were common problems. Many students lost interest and motivation.[math]\textbf{Mental Health and Social Impact:}[/math]
 Isolation from classmates, stress of online learning, and uncertainty about exams caused mental pressure. Many students fell into depression, anxiety, or laziness. Physical activities stopped, and social development was hampered.[math]\textbf{Positive Outcomes:}[/math]
 Despite challenges, the crisis increased awareness of digital learning. Teachers and students learned new technologies. Educational apps and TV programs (like Sangsad TV in Bangladesh) reached some remote learners. It also showed the importance of internet and IT in education.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 COVID-19 showed us that education must be flexible and accessible to all. Digital tools must be developed, and students must be supported emotionally and technologically. Education must go on, no matter the situation.

Explanation:
The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected education worldwide, forcing rapid changes in how teaching and learning occur. School closures and restrictions in 2020 compelled institutions to adopt remote learning almost overnight. This shift exposed disparities in access to devices, internet connectivity, and suitable learning environments, widening educational inequalities for students from low-income families and rural areas. Teachers had to learn new digital tools and redesign lessons for online delivery, highlighting strengths in innovation but also revealing challenges in training, assessment, and student engagement.

Remote learning offered benefits such as flexible scheduling and increased use of educational technologies, which can support personalized learning when implemented equitably. However, many students experienced learning loss due to reduced instructional time, limited interaction with teachers, and fewer opportunities for hands-on and social learning. Assessment methods became less standardized, raising concerns about academic integrity and accurate measurement of student progress.

The pandemic also affected mental health: students, parents, and educators faced stress, isolation, and burnout, affecting motivation and performance. In response, systems developed hybrid models, expanded digital resources, and prioritized health protocols to safely reopen schools. Policy makers are now focusing on remedial programs, investments in digital infrastructure, teacher professional development, and strategies to address learning gaps and emotional well-being.

Ultimately, COVID-19 accelerated educational innovation but underscored the need for equitable access, robust support systems, and preparedness for future disruptions. Lessons learned can guide reforms to make education more resilient, inclusive, and adaptable, and ensure opportunity for every learner to thrive worldwide equitably.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Importance of Reading Books}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Books are called the best friends of human beings. They are a great source of knowledge, entertainment, and wisdom. Reading books develops our personality, improves language skills, and helps us understand life better. In this digital age, reading is more important than ever.[math]\textbf{Benefits of Reading:}[/math]
 Reading increases vocabulary and improves communication skills. It enhances imagination and creativity. Books inspire people, motivate them, and change their mindset. Reading also reduces stress, improves memory, and sharpens the brain.[math]\textbf{Types of Books:}[/math]
 Different people enjoy different kinds of books — story books, novels, biographies, science books, religious books, and history books. Each type helps us grow in different ways. Fiction teaches empathy and culture; non-fiction teaches facts and life skills.[math]\textbf{Role in Student Life:}[/math]
 For students, reading is the foundation of learning. Good books shape young minds. They prepare students to face challenges and become responsible citizens. Textbooks help in exams, but extra reading builds confidence and curiosity.[math]\textbf{Reading Habit:}[/math]
 Unfortunately, many students today spend more time on phones than books. Libraries should be improved and reading clubs introduced. Parents and teachers should encourage reading from childhood.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Reading books is a lifelong gift. It opens doors to knowledge and new worlds. Everyone should read regularly and make books their true companions.

Explanation:
Reading books is one of the most important habits a person can develop. Books expand knowledge, stimulate imagination, and improve language skills. Through reading, we encounter new ideas, cultures, and perspectives that broaden our understanding of the world. Regular reading enhances concentration and critical thinking, helping readers analyze information and form reasoned opinions. It also enriches vocabulary and improves writing ability, as exposure to varied sentence structures and expressions influences one’s own communication.

Books offer both practical information and emotional insight. Nonfiction provides facts, techniques, and frameworks for solving problems, while fiction cultivates empathy by letting readers live lives and emotions beyond their own experiences. Reading reduces stress and provides mental relaxation; immersing oneself in a well-written book can be a restorative escape from daily pressures. For students, reading is foundational to academic success: comprehension and retention skills developed through reading transfer directly to studying and exam performance.

In the digital age, reading remains crucial despite the prevalence of short online content. Deep reading—engaging with longer texts—builds sustained attention and the ability to synthesize complex arguments. Libraries and digital platforms make books more accessible, so cultivating reading habits from a young age is both possible and beneficial. Encouraging regular reading, selecting diverse genres, and setting aside dedicated reading time can help individuals reap the intellectual, emotional, and social benefits that books offer. In short, reading is a lifelong investment that nurtures mind, language, and character. Making reading a daily habit ensures continual growth and enriches every stage of life meaningfully.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{The Life of a Day Labourer}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Life of a Day Labourer}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 A day labourer is a person who earns his living by doing hard physical work on a daily basis. He works in fields, construction sites, factories, and markets. His life is full of struggle and uncertainty. Though his work is vital for society, his condition is often ignored.[math]\textbf{Daily Life:}[/math]
 A day labourer wakes up early in the morning and goes to the labor station or roadside to find work. Sometimes he gets hired; sometimes he returns home empty-handed. He works under the sun or in the rain. His work includes carrying bricks, digging, ploughing fields, or loading goods.[math]\textbf{Living Condition:}[/math]
 Most day labourers live in slums or poor huts. They often do not have access to clean water, electricity, or proper sanitation. Their meals are simple — rice, lentils, or leftover food. They cannot afford good clothes, education for their children, or medical treatment.[math]\textbf{Struggles:}[/math]
 A day labourer’s income is low and irregular. When he falls sick, he loses work and income. During off-seasons, disasters, or lockdowns, their situation becomes worse. Even with honest work, they are often treated without respect by others.[math]\textbf{Importance in Society:}[/math]
 Despite all these struggles, day labourers play a vital role in the development of the country. Roads, buildings, and crops would not exist without their hard work. They are the real builders of the nation.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 We must respect and support day labourers. Government and society should ensure fair wages, housing, healthcare, and education for their children. Their lives deserve dignity and better opportunities.

Explanation:
Explanation: A good 250-word composition on "The Life of a Day Labourer" succeeds because it succinctly presents the worker’s daily routine, economic hardships, social dignity, and hopes while using a clear introduction, focused body, and empathetic conclusion. To achieve this, organize the piece into a short opening that states the theme, one or two body paragraphs with concrete details (work tasks, wages, family impact, resilience), and a closing that reflects on solutions or respect for labourers. Keep language simple, use vivid but concise examples, and watch the word limit so each sentence contributes directly to the main picture and message.

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Padma Bridge: A Symbol of National Pride}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 The Padma Bridge is one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of Bangladesh. It stands as a symbol of national pride, strength, and self-reliance. After many challenges and delays, it was finally opened to the public on June 25, 2022. This bridge has connected the southern part of Bangladesh with the capital and northern districts.[math]\textbf{Construction and Significance:}[/math]
 The Padma Bridge is the largest bridge ever built in Bangladesh. It is a multipurpose road-rail bridge, 6.15 kilometers long. It was constructed with the country’s own funding, without foreign aid, which makes it even more special. It shows Bangladesh’s determination to overcome challenges.[math]\textbf{Benefits:}[/math]
 This bridge will boost trade, travel, and communication. It will reduce travel time and cost for people living in the southern districts. It will also improve healthcare, education, and business in those areas. Farmers and entrepreneurs can now reach markets faster. The bridge is expected to increase the national GDP by more than 1% in the coming years.[math]\textbf{Symbolic Value:}[/math]
 Beyond practical benefits, the Padma Bridge is a source of pride. It proves that Bangladesh can take on mega projects with its own talent and resources. It is a gift of courage, vision, and engineering brilliance.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 The Padma Bridge is not just a structure — it is a symbol of unity and progress. It reminds us what a nation can achieve with strong will and hard work. Every citizen of Bangladesh feels proud of it.

Explanation:
The correct approach is to present the Padma Bridge as a symbol of national pride by linking its engineering achievement to concrete benefits—improved connectivity, economic growth, job creation, and national confidence. Organize the 250-word composition with a brief introduction (context and significance), 1–2 focused body paragraphs (construction highlights and socioeconomic impacts), and a concise conclusion that restates its symbolic value. Use simple, specific details and clear transitions so the reader sees both the factual importance and the emotional pride the bridge inspires.

Write a composition on [math]\textbf{The Rivers of Bangladesh}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Rivers of Bangladesh}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Bangladesh is often referred to as the “Land of Rivers.” There are more than 700 rivers crisscrossing the country. These rivers are not only a gift of nature but also the foundation of the country's agriculture, transportation, trade, and culture.[math]\textbf{Major Rivers:}[/math]
 Some of the major rivers are the Padma, Jamuna, Meghna, Brahmaputra, Teesta, Surma, and Karnaphuli. These rivers help in irrigation, fishing, and connecting remote villages to towns and cities. Rivers are also sacred in religion and celebrated in poems and songs.[math]\textbf{Importance:}[/math]
 Rivers bring fertility to the land by depositing alluvial soil. They are vital for rice and jute farming, which are key agricultural products. People travel by boat through rivers. Fishermen catch hilsa and other fish, earning their livelihood. River ports like Narayanganj and Barisal play a role in national trade.[math]\textbf{Cultural Significance:}[/math]
 Rivers are deeply rooted in Bengali literature and art. Famous poets like Rabindranath Tagore and Jasimuddin wrote beautiful verses inspired by river life. Boat races, festivals, and folk music often happen by the riverside.[math]\textbf{Threats and Protection:}[/math]
 Unfortunately, many rivers are dying due to pollution, illegal grabbing, and overuse. Factories release toxic waste into rivers. Climate change is also affecting water flow. River protection laws and awareness campaigns are urgently needed.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Rivers are like the blood vessels of Bangladesh. To save our country, we must save our rivers. Proper care and use of rivers will ensure our future prosperity.

Explanation:
A 250-word composition is appropriate because it gives enough space to introduce the topic, name and describe major rivers (like the Padma, Jamuna and Meghna), explain their roles in irrigation, transport and culture, and mention problems such as flooding and pollution. Organize it into a short introduction, one or two body paragraphs that give facts and examples about importance and issues, and a brief conclusion with a personal comment or suggestion. Focus on clear facts, cause-and-effect (how rivers shape land and livelihoods), and simple linking sentences so readers understand both the information and its significance.

Explanation:
The composition is correct because it clearly explains how technology improves education—by increasing access to information, enabling interactive and personalized learning, supporting collaboration, and aiding assessment—while also noting challenges like equity and distraction. It helps students understand the underlying concept that technology is a pedagogical tool: its benefits depend on how teachers integrate it into lessons and on students’ digital skills. Clear examples, balanced points, and a logical structure make the 250-word piece effective for conveying both practical uses and limitations.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Role of Youth in National Development}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Youth are the strength and future of a nation. They are energetic, creative, and full of new ideas. If guided properly, they can lead a country towards prosperity and progress. In Bangladesh, a large portion of the population is young. Therefore, the role of youth in national development is very crucial.[math]\textbf{Contribution in Education and Innovation:}[/math]
 Educated and skilled youth bring innovation to technology, science, and business. They research, invent, and improve processes. Young people can solve national problems like unemployment, corruption, and poverty through new ideas and entrepreneurship.[math]\textbf{Social and Political Engagement:}[/math]
 Youth must be aware of social issues like gender inequality, drug abuse, and climate change. They can join social campaigns, awareness programs, and community development projects. In politics, honest and educated youth can promote transparency and ethical leadership.[math]\textbf{Economic Development:}[/math]
 Young entrepreneurs start small businesses and create jobs. Skilled workers in ICT, freelancing, and startups are earning foreign currency. Agriculture and rural development also benefit from youth involvement with modern tools and methods.[math]\textbf{Obstacles and Solutions:}[/math]
 Many youths suffer from lack of education, unemployment, and addiction. The government must ensure proper training, loans for business, and career counseling. Moral and ethical education is essential to keep youth on the right path.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 The future of Bangladesh depends on how we engage and empower our youth. If we educate and support them, they will build a strong, honest, and prosperous nation.

Explanation:
The composition is correct because it presents a clear central idea—that youth are key agents of national development—and supports it with specific roles (education, innovation, entrepreneurship, civic participation) and practical examples. It helps readers understand by organizing points logically, using simple language, and linking each role to how it advances society and the economy. The conclusion reinforces responsibility and actionable steps, making the argument persuasive and complete within the 250-word limit.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Season I Like Best (Spring)}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Among the six seasons in Bangladesh, I like spring the most. It is called the queen of all seasons. It comes with beauty, charm, and freshness. The months of Falgun and Chaitra make up this season. Nature seems to wear a new dress in spring, and everything looks colorful and pleasant.[math]\textbf{Comparison with Other Seasons:}[/math]
 Compared to summer, which is very hot and sometimes unbearable, spring is very enjoyable. Unlike the rainy season that often brings floods and suffering, spring brings joy and happiness. Winter is too cold for many people, but spring has a balanced temperature. Neither too hot nor too cold — it is just perfect. That is why spring stands out among all the seasons.[math]\textbf{Beauty of Spring:}[/math]
 Spring is the season of flowers and greenery. Trees get new leaves, and flowers bloom everywhere. Birds sing sweet songs. Bees fly from flower to flower. The air feels fresh, and the sky is mostly clear. Festivals like Pohela Falgun and Valentine’s Day are also celebrated during this time, adding to its charm.[math]\textbf{My Feelings:}[/math]
 Spring always fills my heart with peace. When I see nature blooming, I feel energetic and inspired. My mind becomes fresh, and I feel closer to nature.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Although every season has its own value, spring is my most favorite. Its beauty, mild weather, and cheerful environment make it special. I wait for this season every year because it brings color, joy, and new life to everything around us.

Explanation:
A good 250-word composition on "The Season I Like Best" is correct when it clearly names the season, gives specific reasons and sensory details (sight, smell, sound, activities), and ends with a concise personal conclusion — this shows both explanation and personal feeling. Structurally, use a short introduction stating your choice, two or three body paragraphs each with one main reason and an example or image, and a brief conclusion that reinforces why the season matters to you; this keeps the essay coherent and appropriately paced for the word limit. Use vivid but simple language, varied sentence lengths, and linkers (because, therefore, meanwhile) to maintain flow and make your preference convincing and easy to follow.

Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Traffic Jam in Dhaka City}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Traffic Jam in Dhaka City}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Traffic jam is a daily problem in Dhaka city. It wastes time, increases stress, and causes loss in economy. Millions of people get stuck on roads every day due to poor planning and lack of traffic control.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 There are many reasons. The number of vehicles is increasing rapidly, but roads remain narrow. Illegal parking, roadside markets, and lack of flyovers make it worse. Rickshaws, buses, cars, and CNGs fight for space. Poor traffic management and frequent violations of rules also add to the problem.[math]\textbf{Effects:}[/math]
 Traffic jam wastes valuable working hours. Students are late to school, and patients can’t reach hospitals in time. Fuel is wasted, and air pollution increases. People become tired and angry even before starting work.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 Public transport should be improved to reduce private cars. Metro rail and bus rapid transit systems must be expanded. Footpaths and cycle lanes should be created. Traffic police must be well-trained and strict. People should follow traffic rules and show patience.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Dhaka needs urgent action to solve traffic jams. Modern planning, discipline, and awareness can bring back smooth movement and reduce public suffering.

Explanation:
The composition is correct because it clearly follows a structured approach—introduction, causes of traffic jams in Dhaka, effects on people and the economy, practical solutions, and a concise conclusion—keeping focus on the topic. It demonstrates understanding by linking specific local causes (rapid urbanization, inadequate infrastructure, excess vehicles, poor traffic management) to concrete effects (time loss, air pollution, stress, economic waste) and proposing realistic measures (improving public transport, better traffic planning, enforcement of laws). The essay’s coherent organization, appropriate vocabulary, and balanced coverage make it suitable for a 250-word composition and easy for examiners to assess.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Tree Plantation}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Trees are an important part of our environment. They give us life and support the balance of nature. Without trees, we cannot survive. So tree plantation is not only necessary, it is a duty for all of us.[math]\textbf{Benefits of Trees:}[/math]
 Trees provide oxygen, shade, and fruits. They absorb carbon dioxide and reduce air pollution. They stop soil erosion, bring rain, and keep the weather pleasant. Trees are home to many birds and animals.[math]\textbf{Economic and Health Benefits:}[/math]
 Trees give us wood, medicine, and raw materials. They reduce stress, make our surroundings peaceful, and help us live longer. Parks and gardens with trees make cities more livable.[math]\textbf{Condition in Bangladesh:}[/math]
 Our country needs more trees. According to experts, 25% of land should be forested, but we have much less. Deforestation is harming our environment.[math]\textbf{Best Time and Awareness:}[/math]
 The rainy season is the best time for planting trees. Schools, colleges, and government offices should organize tree plantation programs. People should be aware of its importance and join such efforts.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Tree plantation is a great act of service to nature and future generations. If every person plants and cares for at least one tree, we can make our world greener and better.

Explanation:
A correct 250-word composition on Tree Plantation is effective because it presents a clear introduction, explains main points (environmental, social and economic benefits), outlines practical methods of planting and care, and ends with a strong concluding call to action. This structure helps students understand the underlying concept by linking causes and effects—how trees reduce pollution, conserve soil and water, support biodiversity, and improve livelihoods—using simple examples and logical progression. To write such an answer, follow the pattern: brief introduction, 3–4 focused paragraphs each with one main idea and supporting detail, and a concise conclusion that includes a personal or community commitment.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Unemployment Problem in Bangladesh}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Unemployment means the condition of people who are willing to work but cannot find jobs. It is one of the major socio-economic problems in Bangladesh. Despite having a large population, the country cannot provide enough employment for its citizens.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 The main causes are overpopulation, lack of proper education, limited industries, and poor planning. Many students graduate with degrees that do not match market needs. Rural-urban migration also increases pressure on city jobs. Corruption and nepotism in recruitment worsen the problem.[math]\textbf{Types:}[/math]
 There are several types of unemployment — educated unemployment, seasonal unemployment, and disguised unemployment (where more people work than needed). Many young graduates remain jobless for years.[math]\textbf{Effects:}[/math]
 Unemployment causes frustration, depression, and sometimes crime. It increases poverty and weakens the economy. Skilled people leave the country, leading to brain drain. Families suffer from poor living standards.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 Technical education and vocational training should be encouraged. New industries and small businesses must be supported. The government should offer loans and incentives to young entrepreneurs. Corruption in job sectors must be stopped.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Unemployment is a threat to development. A nation cannot grow with unemployed youth. Creating job opportunities must be our top priority.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Uses and Abuses of the Internet}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 The Internet is one of the most powerful inventions of modern science. It connects people from all over the world in seconds. Today, it is used in education, communication, business, entertainment, health care, and almost every field of life. But like every tool, it has both good and bad sides.[math]\textbf{Uses:}[/math]
 The internet is a storehouse of knowledge. Students use it to learn, attend online classes, and access e-books and tutorials. People can send emails, attend video calls, and share documents instantly. Online banking, shopping, booking tickets, and paying bills have made life easier. Farmers get weather forecasts and market prices. Doctors use the internet for research and online consultations.[math]\textbf{Abuses:}[/math]
 However, the internet is often misused. Students sometimes spend hours on games, social media, or watching videos, neglecting studies. Addiction to Facebook, TikTok, or online gaming is harming the mental and physical health of youth. Cybercrime, hacking, identity theft, online fraud, and fake news are major concerns. Children can also be exposed to harmful content.[math]\textbf{Impact on Society:}[/math]
 While the internet connects people, it also isolates them. Family interactions are decreasing as everyone is busy on screens. Misinformation spreads quickly, causing panic and confusion. Online harassment and cyberbullying have increased. Internet scams cost people their money and trust.[math]\textbf{How to Use Wisely:}[/math]
 We must learn to use the internet carefully. Parental control and time limits can protect children. People should verify facts before sharing. Online etiquette and digital safety should be taught in schools.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 The internet is a blessing if used wisely and a curse if misused. It depends on us how we use it. Let us use the internet to grow, learn, and build a better future.

Explanation:
A good 250-word composition on [math]Uses\ and\ Abuses\ of\ the\ Internet[/math] is correct when it balances positive aspects (education, communication, information access, e-commerce) with negative ones (privacy risks, addiction, misinformation, cybercrime), uses a clear structure (intro, body paragraphs with examples, conclusion), and offers practical suggestions to reduce abuses. To write this, organize ideas logically, use simple concrete examples for each point, and finish with a brief recommendation so the reader sees both understanding and responsible judgment.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Value of Time}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Time is the most valuable thing in our life. It is more precious than money, gold, or anything else. Once time is gone, it never returns. So, we must value every second and use time wisely.[math]\textbf{Importance in Life:}[/math]
 Everything in the world follows time. The sun rises and sets on time. Trains and planes run according to schedule. If we do not use time properly, we fall behind in life. Time helps us become successful and respected.[math]\textbf{Time for Students:}[/math]
 Student life is the best time to build a future. Those who study regularly, follow routine, and do everything on time become good students. Laziness and delay bring failure and sadness. So, students should make good use of their time.[math]\textbf{Famous Quotes:}[/math]
 There is a saying — “Time and tide wait for none.” This teaches us that we must not waste time. Another saying is — “Work while you work, play while you play.” This tells us that everything has a proper time.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Time is like a sword — if we do not cut with it, it will cut us. Success and happiness depend on proper use of time. So, we should always be punctual, organized, and never waste time.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Women Empowerment in Bangladesh}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Women empowerment means giving women the right to participate equally in all areas of life — education, employment, decision-making, and leadership. In Bangladesh, women’s status is improving, but still many challenges remain.[math]\textbf{Importance:}[/math]
 Empowered women contribute to family income, children’s education, and the country’s progress. They raise their voices against injustice and help build a more equal society. No nation can develop if half of its population is left behind.[math]\textbf{Progress in Bangladesh:}[/math]
 In recent years, Bangladesh has made good progress. Girls now go to school and do well in exams. Many women work in garments, banks, education, and even police and army. Women are now ministers, doctors, engineers, and entrepreneurs.[math]\textbf{Obstacles:}[/math]
 But problems still exist. Many girls face early marriage, domestic violence, and lack of safety. In rural areas, women often have less freedom. Social customs and lack of education make it hard for them to grow.[math]\textbf{How to Empower:}[/math]
 Education is key. Educated women become confident and independent. Laws must protect women’s rights. Workplaces must ensure safety and respect. Media and community leaders must promote positive role models.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Women empowerment is not a choice — it is a necessity. If we educate and support our girls, they will change the future of Bangladesh. Empowered women mean a strong nation.

Explanation:
This composition correctly addresses "Women Empowerment in Bangladesh" by covering essential themes—education, economic participation, legal reforms, grassroots programs, and ongoing challenges—providing a balanced and informative overview. It uses a clear structure (brief introduction, focused body with concrete examples like microcredit and increased political participation, and a conclusion) and stays within the 250-word limit to maintain clarity and coherence. Understanding why this is right means recognizing how specific measures (education, laws, economic opportunities) lead to greater agency for women while noting that cultural and structural barriers still require continued effort.

I hope you are doing well. I am writing this email to share some wonderful news with you. My annual examination has recently ended, and I am very happy to inform you that I have done really well in all the subjects. I worked very hard this time and tried to revise all the lessons properly.

Thanks to my regular study and guidance from teachers, I was able to answer all the questions with confidence. My physical and mental health also supported me a lot during the exam days. As a result, I have achieved the first position in my class! This is a moment of great joy for me and I wanted to share it with you first. I will try to keep this position in the next exams too with your blessings.

Please share this news with Mum. I hope to hear from you soon.

Solution:
To: jamil@yahoo.com

Subject: Request to Return My Book

Dear Jamil,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing this email to remind you of something important. A few weeks ago, you borrowed a book from me titled "A Comprehensive Handbook on Everyday Grammar" by Principal Hasan Ali. I gave it to you willingly because I know you are also interested in grammar. However, you have not returned it yet.

I believe you may have forgotten, so I thought of writing to remind you. The annual examination is coming soon, and this book is extremely important for my preparation. I need to revise all the grammar rules and exercises from that book. Without it, I might face difficulties while studying.

I would be grateful if you could return the book as soon as possible. You can give it to me during school hours or drop it off at my house if that’s easier.

Looking forward to getting it back soon.

Thanking you,

Jubair

Explanation:
A polite, concise email that states the book title, when it was borrowed, and a clear but friendly request to return it is correct because it gives the recipient all necessary details without sounding rude.

Dear Nabila,

I was really sorry to hear that you have been unwell for the past few days. I hope you are taking proper rest and following the doctor’s advice. I know it’s hard to stay away from school and friends, but your health is the most important right now.

We all miss you in class. Even our class teacher asked about you. The classroom feels incomplete without your cheerful presence. Don’t worry about the lessons — I’ve been taking notes for you and will help you catch up once you return. Just focus on your recovery now.

May Allah bless you with good health very soon. We’re all waiting to see you back at school, smiling like before.

Get well soon!

Your friend,

Fahim

Explanation:
A get-well e-mail is appropriate because it expresses empathy, offers support, and helps the friend feel cared for during recovery.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To: nafisa@yahoo.com

Subject: I Performed on Victory Day!

Dear Nafisa,

I hope you’re doing great. I have something exciting to tell you! This year, on Victory Day, our school arranged a cultural program and I got the chance to perform on stage. It was a drama based on the Liberation War of 1971. I played the role of a young freedom fighter.

At first, I was really nervous because this was my first time on stage in front of so many people. But once the program started, I felt confident and gave my best. Everyone clapped and cheered after the drama. Even our Headmaster praised my acting! It felt like all the rehearsals and hard work finally paid off.

I wish you were there to see it. I’ll try to send you some pictures. Let’s meet soon to catch up.

Your loving friend,

Shrea

Explanation:
The correct answer works because it follows a clear informal-email structure: a brief greeting, a subject/purpose line saying you performed on Victory Day, a short paragraph describing what you did, when and where, and a friendly closing with your feelings or an invitation to see photos. The underlying concept is to inform concisely and politely by giving the essential facts (event, your role, time/place) and adding a personal touch so the friend understands and feels connected. Keep sentences short, use a warm conversational tone, and end with a clear sign-off.

You might be amazed to know that we have the world’s longest sea beach at Cox’s Bazar. The Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest, is home to the royal Bengal tiger. In Sylhet, you’ll see tea gardens on green hills. There are also historical places like Mahasthangarh and the Shat Gambuj Mosque.

Dear Shahab,

I hope this message finds you well. As you know, our test examination is approaching next month, and I am very worried about my preparation in Bangla.

If you have any prepared notes or questions from your tutor, I would be very thankful to receive them.

Subject: My Experience at the Science Fair

Dear Shuvo,

I hope you are doing great. I want to share my exciting experience of visiting the National Science Fair held at our city auditorium last Friday. It was an amazing event full of creativity and innovation.

Many schools and colleges participated in the fair. The projects included robotics, solar energy, environmental protection, water purification, and many more. I was really amazed to see a robot that could talk and serve water! I also saw a model of a smart home powered by solar panels. One of the most interesting stalls showed how plastic waste can be turned into fuel. These young minds truly inspired me.

It was a great learning experience for me, and I wish you were there to enjoy it with me. Let me know how your studies are going.

Your friend,

Rafi

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
To: swapnil@yahoo.com

Subject: My New Address

Hi Swapnil,

How are you, my friend? It’s been quite some time since we last talked, and I really miss our fun times together. I wanted to share with you that we have recently moved out of the city due to my father’s new job. Now we are living in a quiet little village, which is very different from the city life we were used to.

Life here is peaceful but also very busy in a different way. I’m helping my parents around the house, and I’ve also enrolled in a creative writing course that I found nearby. I must admit, I’m enjoying this rural life even though sometimes I feel a bit out of place because of the local dialect!

Here’s my new address in case you want to send me a letter or visit during holidays:

Robin

House No: 3342

Village: Kashimpur (Union No. 9)

Thana: Muktagacha

Zila: Mymensingh

Write me back soon!

Your friend,

Robin

Explanation:
The email is correct because it clearly states the purpose (change of address), gives the full new address and effective date, and includes a polite greeting, contact details, and a request to update records so your friend can easily note the change. The underlying concept is to be concise and explicit—provide complete address information and a way to contact you so the recipient can immediately act or follow up if needed.

Some of them are about to die for want of food and treatment.You are lucky that you reside in Dhaka that is hardly affected by flood.

Explanation:
একটি আমন্ত্রণপত্রে সবকিছু স্পষ্ট রাখলে পাবলিক জানে কখন, কোথায় এবং কিভাবে যোগ দিতে হবে—তাই তারিখ, স্থান, সময় ও অংশগ্রহণকারীদের উল্লেখ করা উচিত। বন্ধুকে আমন্ত্রণ জানাতে সদয় ও অনুরোধকারী ভাষা ব্যবহার করলে সম্পর্ক বজায় থাকে এবং সে সহজে সিদ্ধান্ত নিতে পারে। এছাড়া যোগাযোগের একটি নম্বর বা ঠিকানা দিলেই অনুপস্থিতি বা পরিবর্তন জানানো সুবিধা হয়।

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা: এই চিঠি সঠিক কারণ এতে লেখক নিজেকে পরিচয় দেয় এবং রোবিনকে স্পষ্টভাবে গ্রীষ্মকালীন ছুটিতে আমন্ত্রণ জানায়, পাশাপাশি সম্ভাব্য সময়, থাকার বন্দোবস্ত এবং যোগাযোগের তথ্য দেয় যাতে রোবিন সিদ্ধান্ত নিতে পারে। আন্তরিক ও সচ্ছ ভাষা এবং দরকারি বিশদ থাকায় উদ্দেশ্য পরিষ্কার থাকে। ব্যক্তিগত আমন্ত্রণমূলক চিঠিতে প্রথাগত উপাদান—অভিবাদন, আমন্ত্রণের কারণ ও সময়, পাশাপাশি বন্ধুত্বপূর্ণ সমাপ্তি—এই চিঠিতে উপস্থিত থাকায় এটি কার্যকর।

105 Shantinagar Road, Dhaka-100010 March 2025Dear Sakib,Thank you for your letter in which you have wanted to know about my aim in life. In this letter I want to tell you about the aim of my life. You know that the distressed people of our country die without proper medical care. This is because there is a great shortage of doctors in our villages. I have, therefore, made up my mind to be a doctor to serve these unfortunate rural folks. I do not like to earn money to be rich. I want to serve my countrymen and relieve them from pain and sufferings.

Explanation:
উত্তরটি সঠিক কারণ চিঠিটিতে ইংরেজি শেখার প্রয়োজনীয়তা বাস্তব জীবনের উদাহরণ দিয়ে স্পষ্টভাবে বোঝানো হয়েছে—যেমন যোগাযোগ, পড়াশোনা, ভবিষ্যৎ চাকরি ও অনলাইন তথ্য গ্রহণের সুযোগ। সাধারণ ধারনাটি হল যে চিঠি বন্ধুৎ্বপূর্ণ ভাষায়, ছোট-ছোট উদাহরণ ও সুবিধা দেখিয়ে ছোট বোনকে অনুপ্রাণিত করবে এবং শেখার সহজ উপায়গুলো (প্রতিদিন অনুশীলন, বই ও গান ইত্যাদি) বলবে। চিঠি হলে গঠনটা সহজ রাখতে হবে: নমস্কার, কারণ-বিবরণ ও উদাহরণ, শেখার পরামর্শ এবং বন্ধুবৎসল সমাপ্তি।
