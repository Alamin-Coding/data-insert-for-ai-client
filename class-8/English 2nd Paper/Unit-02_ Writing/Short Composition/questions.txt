Question:
Value of Time

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Value of Time
Introduction: Time is more valuable than health and wealth. Art is long, but time is short. Our life is nothing but a sum total of hours, days and years. Time once gone is gone for ever. &quot;Time and tide wait for none.&quot; It can not be called back even with all the wealth of the world.
Importance of making good use of time: Wasting time is a great offence. It is like committing suicide. It leads a man to miseries and ruin. Idleness is the root of all evils. &quot;An idle brain is the devils workshop&quot; goes a well known saying. Students are the future hope and strength of nation. Their life is the life of preparation for the struggle of future life. They should act upon the maxims. &quot;As you sow, so will you reap&quot; and &quot;A stitch in time saves nine.&quot;
All the great men of the world made the best use of their time. They left their footprints on the sands of time by making proper use of their time. It is true in the case of nations too.
The proper use of time is the secret of success in life. Our motto of doing work should be expressed now and not tomorrow, because tomorrow is not workless.
Conclusion: Thus we find that our success and happiness depend on proper use of time. We, therefore, should follow the maxim minutely. &quot;Work while you work, play while you play.&quot;

Question:
Duties of A Student

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Duties of A Student

Introduction: Students are the future of a nation and they have important duties to fulfill. Their main responsibility is to study well, develop good habits, and become disciplined, honest, and responsible citizens.
Primary duty: The primary duty of a student is to learn his lessons and attend school regularly. But nowadays study alone is not enough for a student. He should form the habit of speaking the truth. He should maintain discipline and punctuality (সময়ানুবর্তিতা), He should also be devoted (অনুরক্ত) to religious activities. Besides, he should avoid bad association (সঙ্গ) and form an ideal character of his own.
Duties to parents and superiors: Our parents love us very dearly. During our childhood and helplessness (অসহায়ত্ব), they take every care of us. So it is our bounden duty to express gratitude (কৃতজ্ঞতা) towards them. Students should serve their parents in all possible ways. They should also be respectful to their superiors. They should abide by the advice of their parents and superiors.
Duties to society: Students have youthful vigour. They should devote themselves to social service. They can organise social service squads in their respective institutions (প্রতিষ্ঠান) to work in different areas. They can also organise welfare centres to serve the distressed (বিপদাপন্ন) and destitute people.
Conclusion: It is risky for a student to join active politics. By taking part in active politics he is sure to waste much of his valuable time and energy. So he should be aware of the fact.
