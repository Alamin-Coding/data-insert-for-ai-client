Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
42 East Rampura, Dhaka

26 May 2025

Dear Kazal/Kazli,
How are you? How are you going to spend this summer holiday?
We have a big plan! With some of my friends, we will visit a village. This visit will not be just a simple one but with a purpose. The purpose is to make the villagers aware (সচেতন) of environmental pollution.
The village is in the middle of a forestland, but the saddest thing is that because of increasing population, the villagers are cutting down the trees. They are making more space for houses and farming. You will be surprised to hear that in this way they have already destroyed half of the forest.
The number of animals living in the forest is also decreasing (হ্রাস পাওয়া) day by day. I have heard that rabbits and wild rats are rarely found nowadays. I can say the whole ecosystem is becoming imbalanced (ভারসাম্যহীন).
I hope this visit will be very successful.

All the best
Jamil/Jamila

Dear Mahi,
Your sweet note of the 15th instant has anchored the share of my heart. I am also happy to know that you are very much anxious about the flood occurred all around the country. Recently I have visited a flood affected area and the objective of this letter is to describe this visit to you.
Flood has gripped the entire area. Floodwater has submerged most of the land of this area. Most of the people have lost their houses. They have taken shelter in colleges and schools. Domestic animals have been washed away. Trees have been uprooted. Crops have been damaged heavily. Some people have taken shelter on the roof of the houses. They are passing days without food. They are suffering from want of drinking water, clothes, medicine and so on. Cholera, diarrhoea and dysentery have broken out in an epidemic form. Some of them are about to die for want of food and treatment.
You are lucky that you reside in Dhaka that is hardly affected by flood. Nevertheless you have shown sympathy for the flood affected people and you are trying to collect assistance for them. I am very happy to have such a friend like you. With best love to you.

Yours ever
Sadi

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
22/A West Dhanmondi
Dhaka

11 January 2025

Dear Zim,
I hope you're doing well! I am excited to tell you about the anti-discrimination student movement in Bangladesh, which has made a huge impact on our society.
The movement initially began with students rallying for merit-based opportunities. They wanted to end the unfair quota system, which often limited opportunities for qualified students by reserving a large portion of jobs and university seats for specific groups. As this student-led protest grew, people from all walks of life began to join, seeing it as a stand against systemic discrimination and inequality.
Over time, the movement evolved from focusing solely on quota reforms to challenging the solely on quota reforms to challenging the governments authoritarian actions. The protests became a call for a more democratic and fair system, with the movement finally demanding that the fascist government step down. In the end, it wasn't just about students rights but about justice and equality for all. The unity between students and the general public showed the strength of a united front against discrimination.
Let me know if you want to hear more details!

Best wishes,
Abir

My dear Mina
I am writing this letter with a heavy heart. I know that it is difficult to express it in words. Yet, I am trying to tell you about it.
A few days ago I witnessed a street accident. It took place near our school when we were returning home from school. It was around 4.30. I noticed that a truck was running at a high speed. Raju, a boy of class six in our school, was then crossing the road. But he did not notice the truck. The truck ran over the boy. We rushed to the spot but Raju was no more.
I cannot forget the terrible accident. I still hear the fearful shouts of Raju to save himself. I am writing this to tell you that you must be careful while crossing the road. Only awareness can save us from street accidents.

Sir,
We are the inhabitants of Laksmipur village under your union council. We have the honour to invite your kind attention to the fact that the big canal running along our village is causing a great suffering to the villagers. They have to cross it everyday. School-going children also face untold sufferings as they have to cross it regularly by a small boat. An accident took place here last year when the ferry boat capsized for overloading. So the only solution of this serious problem can be the construction of a bridge over the canal.
We, therefore, hope that you would be kind enough to make immediate arrangement for the construction of a bridge over the canal to save the people from their untold sufferings (অবর্ণনীয় দুর্ভোগ) and oblige thereby.

Dear sir,
We, the inhabitants of Nurpur Village of your union parishad, have the honour to draw your attention to the fact that we have no scope to drink arsenic-free water in our village.

Still it is causing much harm to the health of the inhabitants of this village.
In these circumstances, it is hoped that you would be kind enough to sink a deep tube-well in our village and keep the villagers away from probable danger.
