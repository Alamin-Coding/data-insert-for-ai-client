“Do you know that the Victory Day of Bangladesh is on the 16th of December every year?” asked the teacher. “It marks our independence after a nine-month-long war.”

Explanation:

Question:
while we were returning from the picnic our bus suddenly stopped on the highway due to engine failure everyone got down and waited under a tree until help arrived

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
While we were returning from the picnic, our bus suddenly stopped on the highway due to engine failure. Everyone got down and waited under a tree until help arrived.

Explanation:
The sentence should be split and punctuated as: "While we were returning from the picnic, our bus suddenly stopped on the highway due to engine failure. Everyone got down and waited under a tree until help arrived." The introductory subordinate clause needs a comma before the main clause, and the following independent idea is a new sentence so it must start with a capital letter.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The scientist explained to the audience, “Gravity is a force that pulls everything toward the center of the Earth. It affects everything around us, from falling apples to orbiting planets.”

Explanation:
The scientist is correct: gravity is the universal attractive force between masses that, near Earth’s surface, pulls objects toward the planet’s center and makes things like apples fall. The same force governs orbital motion by providing the inward pull that curves a planet’s straight-line motion into an orbit.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
During the interview, the candidate was asked, “What are your strengths and weaknesses?” He replied, “I am hardworking and honest, but sometimes I get nervous in public speaking.”

Question:
during the inauguration of padma bridge thousands of people gathered to witness the historic moment the prime minister said this is not just a bridge it is a symbol of our pride and capability

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
During the inauguration of Padma Bridge, thousands of people gathered to witness the historic moment. The Prime Minister said, “This is not just a bridge; it is a symbol of our pride and capability.”

Explanation:
"This" refers to the Padma Bridge because the bridge is the nearby noun introduced in the sentence about the inauguration and the prime minister is clearly describing that structure. In grammatical terms, the demonstrative pronoun "this" points to its antecedent (the Padma Bridge), so the PM's words characterize the bridge as a symbol of national pride and capability.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
In the recent floods in Sylhet, many people were displaced. Several organizations, including the Army and Red Crescent, provided food, water, and shelter to the affected families.

Explanation:
The correct answer names the army and the Red Crescent because the sentence explicitly states those organizations "provided food, water and shelter" to displaced families. This shows the basic reading-comprehension concept: identify the subjects (the army and Red Crescent) and their actions (providing aid) from the sentence to determine who helped.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
During the dengue outbreak in Dhaka, doctors advised people to use mosquito nets, clean stagnant water, and visit hospitals if they experienced high fever or body pain.

Explanation:
These measures are correct because dengue is spread by Aedes mosquitoes: using mosquito nets reduces bites and cleaning stagnant water removes the mosquitoes’ breeding sites. Visiting a hospital for high fever or severe body pain is important because dengue can progress quickly and needs medical diagnosis, monitoring, and supportive care to prevent complications.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
After winning the gold medal in the International Math Olympiad, the student said, “I practiced day and night for this achievement, and I want to dedicate it to my country.”

Explanation:
The student’s sentence first gives a cause for the win—“I practiced day and night”—and then expresses an intention to honor the country by dedicating the medal, so the correct answer notes both the cause-and-effect claim and the act of dedication. Understanding this shows the sentence combines an explanatory statement (why they won) with an expressive declaration of dedication.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
At the Book Fair this year, readers showed great interest in books on history and science. One visitor said, “I think this fair is not just a place to buy books; it’s a celebration of culture and learning.”

One visitor said, 'I think this fair is not just a place to buy books; it’s a celebration of culture and learning.'"  
This follows basic rules: start sentences with a capital letter, use a period to separate independent sentences, use quotation marks and a comma/semicolon appropriately for direct speech and closely related clauses, and always capitalize "I."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
During the recent power crisis due to fuel shortage, the government requested everyone to save electricity and reduce unnecessary use of air conditioners and lights.

Explanation:
Explanation: The request is correct because when fuel is scarce power plants cannot generate enough electricity, so lowering use of air conditioners and lights reduces total demand and helps prevent widespread outages. Conserving electricity during a shortage also stretches the limited fuel supply, ensuring essential services get power and reducing the need for severe rationing.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Minister said in the climate conference, “Bangladesh is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries. We need global support to adapt and survive.”

Explanation:
Bangladesh is especially vulnerable because much of the country is low-lying and densely populated, so sea-level rise, more intense cyclones, flooding and salinization directly threaten homes, crops and livelihoods. Since these climate impacts are driven by global emissions and adapting requires large finance, technology and capacity, Bangladesh needs international support to build resilience and protect its people.

Solution:
When Shakib Al Hasan broke another record in international cricket, fans across the country celebrated his achievement. One fan said, “He is a legend of our generation.”

Explanation:
Explanation: Proper nouns and sentence beginnings must be capitalized, so "When" and "Shakib Al Hasan" need capitals. Also place a comma after the introductory clause and use a comma plus quotation marks for the direct speech — for example: "When Shakib Al Hasan broke another record in international cricket, fans across the country celebrated his achievement, and one fan said, 'He is a legend of our generation.'"

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
In response to the road safety protests, the traffic police started checking licenses, helmets, and vehicle documents regularly. Students said, “We want safe roads, not promises.”

Explanation:
Place a comma after the introductory phrase ("In response to the road safety protests,"), use commas between list items ("licenses, helmets, and vehicle documents"), end that sentence, and set the students’ words in quotation marks with a capital letter ("We want safe roads, not promises."). These punctuation rules (introductory comma, list commas, sentence boundary, and quotation marks for direct speech) clarify the sentence structure and make the meaning clear.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a. People living near river banks have to bear the brunt of river erosion.b. The river erosion takes a devastating turn with the onset of the monsoon.c. Vast tracts of cultivable land have been washed away by eroding rivers.d. It has made thousands of people homeless.e. Many areas need special attention for protection from the river erosion.

Explanation:
We form each sentence by taking a subject from the first column, a verb or auxiliary from the second, and a complement from the third, ensuring correct word order and subject–verb agreement. For example, "The river erosion takes a devastating turn with the onset of the monsoon." and "Vast tracts of cultivable land have been washed away by eroding rivers." are correct because the verb forms (takes, have been) agree with their subjects and the phrases together make complete, meaningful sentences.

Question:
Change the following sentences as directed in the brackets.

(a) No other bird flies as high as the eagle. (Comparative)

(b) The eagle is one of the most majestic birds. (Positive)

(c) Some birds are not as sharp-eyed as the eagle. (Superlative)

(d) The eagle flies higher than most other birds. (Superlative)

(e) Isn’t the eagle a great hunter? (Assertive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) The eagle flies higher than any other bird.

(b) Very few birds are as majestic as the eagle.

(c) The eagle is the sharpest-eyed bird.

(d) The eagle is one of the highest-flying birds.

(e) The eagle is a great hunter.

Explanation:
(a) The eagle flies higher than any other bird.
This replaces the negative equality structure "No other bird ... as ... as" with a direct comparative "higher than" to compare the eagle with each other bird.

(b) The eagle is majestic.
This changes the superlative phrase "one of the most majestic" to the positive degree by using the base adjective "majestic."

(c) The eagle is the sharpest-eyed of all birds.
To form the superlative, we use "the" plus the adjective with "-est" ("sharpest-eyed") to say the eagle ranks highest in sharpness of sight.

(d) The eagle is one of the highest-flying birds.
"Flies higher than most other birds" is turned into a superlative group expression "one of the highest-flying" to show it ranks among the top flyers.

(e) The eagle is a great hunter.
Convert the question into an assertive sentence by removing the question form and stating the fact directly.

(c) No other boy is braver than him. (Superlative)

(e) What a talented player he is! (Assertive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) His brother is more active than he.

(b) Very few students are as athletic as his brother.

(c) He is the bravest boy.

(d) He is one of the strongest students.

(e) He is a very talented player.

Explanation:
(a) His brother is more active than he is.
Explanation: "Not as ... as" becomes a direct comparative by using "more + adjective" to compare two people.

(b) His brother is very athletic.
Explanation: "One of the most athletic" (superlative) reduced to the positive degree uses a qualifying word like "very" to keep the meaning without comparison.

(c) He is the bravest boy.
Explanation: "No other boy is braver than him" means he has the highest degree of bravery, so we use the superlative "the bravest."

(d) He is one of the strongest students.
Explanation: "Stronger than most other students" implies he ranks among the top, so we express it as "one of the strongest."

(e) He is a very talented player.
Explanation: The exclamatory sentence is turned into an assertive (declarative) form by using "very" to convey the degree of talent.

(e) How significant the Nile is in history! (Assertive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:

(b) The Nile is the most historic river.

(c) The Amazon is not the longest river.

(d) The Nile is longer than all other rivers.

(e) The Nile is very significant in history.

Explanation:
Solution:
ক The Nile is long.
Explanation: This is the positive degree; we use the base adjective "long" instead of a comparative or superlative form.

খ The Nile is the most historic of all rivers.
Explanation: This uses the superlative ("the most historic") to show the Nile ranks highest in historic importance among all rivers.

গ Not all rivers are shorter than the Amazon.
Explanation: To make the sentence negative we add "not" and reverse the universal claim; it conveys that some rivers are not shorter (i.e., some are longer).

ঘ The Nile is longer than all other rivers.
Explanation: Turning the question into an assertive simply makes it a declarative statement stating the comparison as a fact.

ঙ The Nile is very significant in history.
Explanation: Changing the exclamation to an assertive makes it a plain statement; "very significant" keeps the emphasis in a declarative form.

Solution:

(b) Very few students are as focused as Rahim.

(c) Rahim is more punctual than any other boy in class.

(d) Rahim is the politest boy.

(e) Rahim is the best student in the group.

Explanation:
(a) Rahim is one of the most attentive students.
Explanation: "Only a few students are as attentive as Rahim" means he belongs to the top few; "one of the most" expresses that superlative group.

(b) Most others are not as focused as Rahim.
Explanation: Converting a comparative to the positive degree is done by negation and reversing the order (i.e., "X is more ... than Y" → "Y is not as ... as X").

(c) Rahim is more punctual than any other boy in the class.
Explanation: The superlative "the most punctual" is changed to a comparative by using "more ... than any other," which compares him with each other boy.

(d) Rahim is one of the most polite boys.
Explanation: "Very few boys are as polite as Rahim" means only a small top group match him, so "one of the most polite" states the superlative position.

(e) Rahim is the best student in the group.
Explanation: Change the negative question "Isn’t Rahim...?" into a plain assertive (declarative) sentence by removing the question form.

(c) Smartphones are more essential than smartwatches.

(d) No other gadget is as useful as the smartphone.

(e) The new iPhone is very amazing.

Explanation:
(a) Robotics is the most accurate of all methods.
Robotics uses the superlative "most" with the adjective "accurate" because we are comparing it to all other methods and saying it has the highest degree of accuracy.

(b) AI robots are more intelligent than most machines.
This uses the comparative "more...than" to show AI robots exceed the intelligence of the majority of machines (equivalent to "very few machines are as intelligent as" them).

(c) Smartphones are more essential than smartwatches.
"More...than" replaces the negative "not as...as" to make a clear comparative statement between smartphones and smartwatches.

(d) The smartphone is a useful gadget.
This is the positive degree: remove "one of the most" and the superlative to state the simple fact using the base adjective "useful."

(d) The threat of hacking is not decreasing.

(e) This is the smartest AI chatbot yet.

Explanation:
(a) Cybersecurity is important.
This is the positive degree: remove the comparative word "more" and the phrase "than ever" to state the quality without comparison.

(b) Encryption is the most effective technology.
Superlative expresses the highest degree; use "the most" + adjective and make "encryption" the subject.

(c) Our data is protected by antivirus software.
Passive voice makes the object ("our data") the subject, changes the verb to "is protected," and adds "by antivirus software."

(d) The threat of hacking is not increasing day by day.
Form the negative by inserting "not" after the auxiliary "is" to negate the present continuous verb.

(e) This is the smartest AI chatbot yet.
Assertive (declarative) form turns the question into a direct statement by removing inversion and the question tag.

(a) Very few tools are as fast as Google. (Superlative)

(b) Google is more efficient than many search engines. (Positive)

(c) Only Google can return results in milliseconds. (Negative)

(d) Google Chrome is the most used browser. (Comparative)

(e) What a revolutionary invention Google was! (Assertive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) Google is one of the fastest tools.

(b) Most search engines are not as efficient as Google.

(c) No other tool but Google can return results in milliseconds.

(d) Google Chrome is more used than any other browser.

(e) Google was a very revolutionary invention.

Explanation:
(a) Google is one of the fastest tools.
Explanation: This uses the superlative idea ("one of the fastest") to show Google ranks at the top in speed, matching the original meaning that only a few tools are as fast.

(b) Many search engines are not as efficient as Google.
Explanation: This puts the adjective in the positive degree ("efficient") and uses negation ("not as") to preserve the comparative sense of the original.

(c) No other search engine can return results in milliseconds.
Explanation: "Only Google" is turned into an equivalent negative form ("No other...") to express the same exclusivity.

(d) Google Chrome is used more than any other browser.
Explanation: This converts the superlative ("the most used") into a comparative structure ("used more than") that directly compares Chrome with other browsers.

(e) Google was a revolutionary invention.
Explanation: The exclamatory sentence is changed to a plain assertive (declarative) sentence while keeping the same meaning.

Question:
Change the following sentences as directed in the brackets.

(a) The digital classroom is better than traditional methods. (Superlative)

(b) No method is as interactive as VR-based learning. (Comparative)

(c) Students use apps for daily assignments. (Passive)

(d) Very few devices are as versatile as tablets. (Superlative)

(e) Isn’t coding the most essential skill today? (Assertive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) The digital classroom is the best method.

(b) VR-based learning is more interactive than any other method.

(c) Apps are used by students for daily assignments.

(d) Tablets are among the most versatile devices.

(e) Coding is the most essential skill today.

Explanation:
(a) "The digital classroom is the best method."  
The superlative compares one item with all others, so use "the" + superlative adjective ("best") to show it is superior to all traditional methods.

(b) "VR-based learning is more interactive than any other method."  
A comparative uses "more... than" to compare two or more items; here it shows VR-based learning exceeds other methods in interactiveness.

(c) "Apps are used by students for daily assignments."  
To form the passive, make the object ("apps") the subject and use the verb "be" + past participle ("are used"), with the agent ("by students") optionally included.

(d) "Tablets are the most versatile devices."  
"Versatile" is a multi-syllable adjective, so form the superlative with "the most" to indicate tablets have the highest degree of versatility among devices.

(e) "Coding is the most essential skill today."  
Change the question into an assertive sentence by removing the question form and contraction, keeping the original meaning that coding ranks highest in importance.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Once some merchants were going to Bagdad from Jilan. Bagdad was far away from Jilan. A woman came to the merchants with her son. She said to them, “My son will go to Bagdad to study. Will you take him with you?”

Explanation:
She asked the merchants because they were already going to Baghdad, so they could carry her son there safely and more easily than she could on her own. The request makes sense because Baghdad was far from Jilan and the mother wanted her son to reach the city to study, so asking travelers heading that way was a practical solution.

Question:
whats the time by your watch he said it is half past nine I replied I want to go to school he said would you accompany me please no I am sorry.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
“What’s the time by your watch?” he said. “It is half past nine.” I replied, “I want to go to school.” He said, “Would you accompany me, please?” “No, I am sorry.”

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct version uses quotation marks to show each speaker’s words and places punctuation (like the question mark or comma) inside the quotes; reporting clauses (he said, I replied) follow with a comma when the quote continues and a full stop when it ends. Also each quoted sentence begins with a capital letter and questions use a question mark (e.g., "What's the time by your watch?" he said.), which is why the punctuated/capitalized form is correct.

Question:
alexander the great was the king of macedonia he was the son of philip a mighty king of sparta he invaded india about 327 years before the birth of christ on the way he defeated porus and marched towards the punjab.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Alexander the Great was the king of Macedonia. He was the son of Philip, a mighty king of Sparta. He invaded India about 327 years before the birth of Christ. On the way, he defeated Porus and marched towards the Punjab.

Explanation:
Explanation: Alexander was indeed the king of Macedonia and the son of Philip II of Macedonia; he crossed into the Indian subcontinent around 327 BC and defeated King Porus at the Battle of the Hydaspes (326 BC), after which he advanced into the Punjab. The passage’s main error is calling Philip a king of Sparta—Philip ruled Macedonia, not Sparta—so the sequence (Alexander’s parentage, invasion, victory over Porus, and advance into Punjab) is otherwise correct.

Question:

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The man said, “Can you give me some food? I’ve been starving for two days.” The maid said, “Why do you beg? Can’t you work?”

Explanation:
The man's words become: "The man asked the maid to give him some food, saying he had been starving for two days," because requests are reported with "asked (someone) to …" and present perfect ("I've been") backshifts to past perfect ("he had been"). The maid's questions become: "The maid asked why he begged and why he couldn't work," because question words like "why" stay the same while modals backshift ("can" → "could", "can't" → "couldn't") when reporting.

Question:
mother said to her son tell me why you are wasting your time be punctual and dutiful in your life

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Mother said to her son, “Tell me why you are wasting your time. Be punctual and dutiful in your life.”

Explanation:
The correct reported form is: The mother asked her son why he was wasting his time and told him to be punctual and dutiful in life. This is because direct questions use reporting verbs like "asked" and the present progressive "are wasting" backshifts to past progressive "was wasting", while imperatives become "told/asked + object + to‑infinitive" (you → he).

Question:
what kind of stories will you tell asked the student fables replied the teacher do you know what fables are no replied the students

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
“What kind of stories will you tell?” asked the student. “Fables,” replied the teacher. “Do you know what fables are?” “No,” replied the students.

Explanation:
Corrected version: "What kind of stories will you tell?" asked the student. "Fables," replied the teacher. "Do you know what fables are?" "No," replied the students.

This is correct because direct speech is enclosed in quotation marks, questions inside speech keep the question mark inside the quotes, and when a reporting verb (asked/replied) follows the quote we use a comma before the closing quotation mark (or a question mark if it’s a question) and capitalize the first word of the quoted sentence. A single-word reply like "No" also takes a comma before the reporting verb.

Question:

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
“Kamal, don’t be so silly. He will come soon,” said Anis. “We need not wait for him. He has failed to keep his word,” replied Kamal.

Explanation:
The correct answer puts each spoken sentence in quotation marks, capitalizes sentence starts and names, and uses a comma before the reporting verbs; clauses are separated with a semicolon where needed. Therefore the corrected dialogue is: "Kamal, don't be so silly; he will come soon," said Anis. "We need not wait for him; he has failed to keep his word," replied Kamal.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
We must eat vegetables and fruits. They contain a lot of vitamins and minerals. They keep our body free from diseases.

Explanation:
This is true because vegetables and fruits are rich in vitamins (for example vitamin C and A) and minerals (like potassium and iron) that the body needs. These nutrients help build and repair tissues and strengthen the immune system, so eating them reduces the risk of infections and other diseases.

Explanation:
"Have you finished reading the book?" said Nira. "Yes," said Tannie. "The book is very interesting."

Explanation: Direct speech needs quotation marks and each spoken sentence starts with a capital letter; a question requires a question mark, and when a short answer like "Yes" is followed by a reporting clause it takes a comma before the closing quote; names are capitalized.

Question:
the teacher said to rafiq why are you talking in the class you should behave yourself rafiq replied sir i am sorry i am asking karim to lend me his pen my pen has run out the teacher said be attentive and listen to my lecture

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The teacher said to Rafiq, “Why are you talking in the class? You should behave yourself.” Rafiq replied, “Sir, I am sorry. I am asking Karim to lend me his pen. My pen has run out.” The teacher said, “Be attentive and listen to my lecture.”

Explanation:
Rafiq’s reply is correct because he immediately apologized and gave a brief, truthful reason—he was asking Karim to lend a pen since his own had run out—so his response shows politeness and explanation. The underlying idea is that students should not talk during a lesson; if they need help, they should ask quietly or wait for a suitable moment while still respecting the teacher’s instructions.

Question:
i have got gpa-5 in the jsc examination said samia congratulation what do you intend to do now i want to study in science group i will try to get gpa-5 again in the ssc examination samia replied

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
“I have got GPA-5 in the JSC examination,” said Samia. “Congratulations! What do you intend to do now?” “I want to study in Science group. I will try to get GPA-5 again in the SSC examination,” Samia replied.

Explanation:
When converting to reported speech, tenses are usually backshifted: present perfect "have got" → past perfect "had got", present "want" → "wanted", and "will" → "would". Pronouns and time words change too ("I" → "she", "now" → "then"), so the correct reported form is: Samia said that she had got GPA-5 in the JSC examination; she said she wanted to study in the science group and that she would try to get GPA-5 again in the SSC examination.

Solution:
The Headmaster entered the classroom, looked around, and asked, “Why is the class so noisy? Don’t you know that a class should be quiet and disciplined during the absence of a teacher?”

Explanation:
The correct form is: The headmaster entered the classroom, looked around and asked, "Why is the class so noisy? Don't you know that a class should be quiet and disciplined during the absence of a teacher?" Because these are the speaker’s exact questions, they must be enclosed in quotation marks, begin with capital letters, end with question marks, and be introduced by a comma after "asked."

Question:

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
I met my old friend Rafiq in the book fair. He said, “Hello Jamal! How are you doing? It’s been a long time since we last met.” I said, “Yes, Rafiq, I am doing well and I hope you are fine too.”

Explanation:
The correct version uses standard capitalization and punctuation: capitalize the pronoun "I", proper names like "Rafiq" and sentence beginnings, and include "the" before "book fair." Use quotation marks for direct speech, a comma to set off the name when addressing someone (vocative), a question mark for "How are you doing?" and periods for statements. "It's been" is the correct contraction for "It has been," showing the present perfect used to describe time since the last meeting.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
“Why are you late again?” said the teacher. “You know very well the school starts at 8 a.m. every day. If you continue this, you may not be allowed to attend the class.”

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct form puts the teacher’s exact words in quotation marks and ends the question with a question mark: "Why are you late again?" said the teacher. Separate the statements with full stops or commas and use a comma after the conditional clause: "You know very well the school starts at 8 a.m. every day. If you continue this, you may not be allowed to attend the class." This follows rules for direct speech, sentence punctuation, and time abbreviation.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The traveler asked, “Can you tell me how far it is to the next village?” The boy replied, “Sir, if you keep walking straight down this road, you will reach there in about an hour.”

Explanation:
The boy’s reply gives an approximate travel time rather than a distance: he means that if the traveler continues walking straight along that road without detours, it will take about an hour to reach the next village. So the correct answer is right because the statement supplies both the route ("straight down this road") and an estimated duration ("about an hour").

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Rahim said to Karim, “You should not waste your time. I’d advise you to prepare yourself properly for the upcoming examination, as you have already missed several classes.”

Explanation:
The correct reported form is: "Rahim told Karim not to waste his time and advised him to prepare himself properly for the upcoming examination, as he had already missed several classes." In reported speech pronouns shift ("you" → "him"), reporting verbs move to past ("I'd advise" → "advised"), and present perfect "have missed" backshifts to past perfect "had missed" because the reporting verb is in the past.

Question:

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Mother said, “Rina, take this money and go to the market. Buy some vegetables, fish, and rice. Don’t forget to bring back the change and the receipt.”

Explanation:
Correct form: "Mother said, 'Rina, take this money and go to the market. Buy some vegetables, fish, and rice. Don't forget to bring back the change and the receipt.'"

This is correct because we capitalize the beginning and proper noun, use a comma after "said" to introduce direct speech and a comma after "Rina" when addressing her (vocative), separate items in a list with commas, use periods to end imperatives, and include the apostrophe in "Don't" for the contraction of "do not."

Solution:
He said, “I don’t know what to do anymore. My friends have left me, and I feel like I have no one to talk to.” I replied, “You are never alone. I am always here for you.”

Explanation:
The correct form uses direct-speech punctuation: each speaker’s words are enclosed in quotation marks, the reporting clause is set off with a comma, and pronoun "I" and the first word inside quotes are capitalized. These rules ensure the dialogue is clear and grammatically correct, e.g., He said, "I don't know what to do anymore; my friends have left me and I feel like I have no one to talk to." I replied, "You are never alone; I am always here for you."

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
During the vacation, we visited Cox’s Bazar, the world’s longest sea beach. We enjoyed the waves, the sand, the breeze, and the sunset. It was a wonderful experience.

Explanation:
The corrected sentence capitalizes the sentence start and the proper noun "Cox's Bazar", uses the possessive "world's", and adds commas to separate the list items ("waves, the sand, the breeze, and the sunset"). A period (or semicolon) is used to separate the two main ideas so the visit and the enjoyment are clearly expressed.

Solution:
“I have been working on this project for three weeks,” said Sajib, “and still I feel it needs more improvement before submission.” The teacher replied, “Keep working hard and take your time.”

Explanation:
You should punctuate direct speech with quotation marks and use commas to separate the reporting clause: “I have been working on this project for three weeks,” said Sajib, “and still I feel it needs more improvement before submission.” The teacher’s reply is a separate quoted sentence: “Keep working hard and take your time.” Use capital letters for the pronoun I and sentence starts, and put punctuation inside the quotation marks.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The man knocked at the door and asked, “May I come in, please? I have an appointment with the manager for a job interview.” The receptionist said, “Yes, sir. Please wait in the lobby.”

Explanation:
The correct reported form is: "The man knocked at the door and asked if he could come in, saying he had an appointment with the manager for a job interview. The receptionist replied that he should wait in the lobby." This is correct because in reported speech we shift tenses back (["may" → "could"], ["have" → "had"]), change pronouns as needed, and convert polite requests and imperatives into reporting verbs (asked/replied, or told him to/that he should wait).

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Yesterday, when I was walking through the street near our school, I saw a group of children fighting over a broken toy. One of them was crying loudly, and nobody came to stop them.

Explanation:
The correct answer is the "bystander effect" because when several people are present, each person assumes someone else will help, so nobody intervenes. This concept—called diffusion of responsibility—explains why people often fail to act in emergencies and reminds us to take responsibility and help when we see someone in need.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Principal looked at the students and said, “Those who have not submitted their assignments must do so by tomorrow. Otherwise, strict action will be taken against them.”

Explanation:
Because the reporting verb "said" is in the past, we backshift the tenses and time words: "have not submitted" becomes "had not submitted," "tomorrow" becomes "the next day," and "will be taken" becomes "would be taken." Also modals change with backshifting, so "must" is usually reported as "had to" to keep the original obligation.

Solution:
“Is there any reason you are not wearing your school uniform today?” asked the teacher. The student replied, “Sir, my uniform is torn and I have no other set to wear.”

Explanation:
Solution: The teacher’s question becomes: "The teacher asked if there was any reason he was not wearing his school uniform that day." The student's reply becomes: "He replied that his uniform was torn and he had no other set to wear." This is correct because direct questions use "if/whether" in reported speech, present continuous [math]("are not wearing")[/math] backshifts to past continuous [math]("was not wearing")[/math], pronouns change ([math]"I"→"he"[/math]) and time words shift ([math]"today"→"that day"[/math]).

During the debate competition, one of the participants argued, “Technology is making us lazy and dependent,” while the opponent said, “No, it is helping us to be more efficient and productive.”

Explanation:
Both speakers are right in different ways: technology can make tasks faster and more productive by automating routine work, improving communication, and giving quick access to information. At the same time, overreliance on devices can weaken certain skills, reduce physical activity, and encourage shortcuts that feel like laziness. The overall effect depends on how people use technology—mindful, limited use boosts efficiency, while careless dependence can lead to decline in habits and abilities.

Explanation:
A philosophy professor stood before his class with some items on the table in front of him.
He wordlessly picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar.
The professor began to fill it with rocks about 2 inches in diameter.
A philosophy professor asked the students if the jar was full.
The students agreed that it was.

Explanation: These sentences are made by picking a subject from the first column, a verb from the second, and a complement from the third to form grammatically correct and meaningful statements; small adjustments in word order are used when needed for natural English. The substitution table lets you create different correct sentences by recombining column elements while keeping subject-verb agreement and logical sense.

Explanation:
To make the five correct sentences, join each subject (first column) with the verb (second column) and the object/phrase (third column) but adjust verb form and prepositions for grammar and meaning. Use plural verbs with plural subjects and singular verbs with singular subjects (e.g., "Different colours of flowers remind us of..." or "The vast blue sky is very significant"), and prefer correct collocations like "remind us of" and "inspire us to..." to produce natural, grammatical sentences.

[math]\begin{array}{|l|l|l|} \hline \text{Socrates' wife} & \text{could not tolerate} & \text{to irritate Socrates.} \\ \text{She always} & \text{used} & \text{more furious than ever.} \\ \text{One day the woman} & \text{tried} & \text{to insult him.} \\ \text{She} & \text{became} & \text{this.} \\ \text{Socrates} & \text{began} & \text{to lose her temper on the slightest excuse.} \\ \hline \end{array}[/math]

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a. Socrates' wife used to lose her temper on the slightest excuse.b. She always tried to irritate Socrates.c. One day the woman became more furious than ever.d. She began to insult him.e. Socrates could not tolerate this.

Explanation:
Each horizontal row gives a subject, a verb (or verb phrase), and a complement—so you form a complete sentence by joining them in that order. Make sure verb tense and pronoun references match so the result is grammatical (for example, row three becomes "One day the woman tried to insult him."). Since there are five rows, you can make five correct sentences.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a. A village doctor never deals with critical patients.b. He suggests better treatment of the hospitals for them.c. For this he sometimes has to go through humiliation.d. His service is often a bane for the villagers.e. It is also a boon to the villagers.

Explanation:
1. A village doctor never has to go through humiliation.
2. He often deals with critical patients.
3. For this he sometimes has to go through humiliation.

The category 5 storm left at least 10 dead and thousands homeless.d. More than one hurricane was likely to visit this area.e. The forecaster said it could perish the entire coast of Florida.

Explanation:
Explanation: Use the substitution-table method by choosing one item from each column to make a complete Subject + Verb + Complement sentence; each choice yields a grammatical sentence if the verb form agrees with the subject and tense. Pay attention to verb inflection (for example, replace "be" with "is/are/was/were" as appropriate) and ensure the clause after the verb makes sense with the subject. This is why the sentences formed from the table are correct: they follow standard sentence structure and correct subject–verb agreement.

a. Life is one kind of continuous examination.b. Games become dull if there is no competition.c. A victory is not a real triumph if both sides are not equally strong.d. Efforts are extremely needed for the progress in life.e. Really, life loses its interest without struggle.

Explanation:
Each sentence is formed by taking a subject from the left column, a verb from the middle column, and a complement from the right column and joining them into a grammatically correct statement. Ensure subject–verb agreement and make small adjustments (add auxiliaries or change word order) so the result reads naturally. Using this method yields five correct sentences, for example: "Life loses its interest without struggle" and "Efforts become dull if there is no competition."

This imprisonment of the husband hampers the normal conjugal life.e. We must give up taking dowry because it hampers our dignity.

Explanation:
Explanation: The table gives subject (column 1), verb (column 2) and complement (column 3), so you form each sentence by choosing one item from each column in that order. Make sure subject–verb agreement and natural wording (e.g., use "are" with plural subjects, change "be" to "is/are" as needed) so the sentence is grammatical and meaningful. Thus the correct answers are the meaningful subject–verb–complement sentences formed by these substitutions with minor grammatical adjustments.

a. Chumley, the monkey of the writer lost all interest in life.b. He went off his food.c. He would take about half a mugful of water a day.d. The writer was away at that time.e. His nephew John sent him a frantic message.

Explanation:
Pick one item from the first column (subject), one from the second (verb) and one from the third (object/complement) to make a complete sentence, adjusting pronouns and punctuation as needed. This works because the columns represent subject–predicate–object parts, so combining them yields grammatical sentences (for example, "Chumley, the monkey of the writer, lost all interest in life." or "The writer sent him a frantic message."). Ensure subject–verb agreement and correct pronoun references when you mix parts.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a. The illiterate persons have no access to books.b. They fail to choose between right and wrong.c. Illiteracy is still dominant in our country.d. There is much talk about removal of illiteracy.e. Every educated person has a role to play in the campaign for removal of illiteracy.

Explanation:
Subject–verb agreement is key: plural subjects take "have" (e.g. "The illiterate persons/They have…"), while singular or abstract subjects take "has" or "is" as appropriate. Also choose the correct noun form for meaning: use "Illiterate people" (not "Illiteracy") when you mean persons ("Illiterate people have no access to books"), and use "There is much talk…" because "much talk" is singular. Correcting these agreements and noun choices makes the five sentences grammatically correct.

Explanation:
To make sentences, pick one phrase from each column in the order: subject + verb phrase + object/complement. Ensure subject–verb agreement and that the verb phrase fits the meaning (e.g., a singular subject takes "is," transitive verbs need an appropriate object, and some phrases need rewording to be grammatical). By applying these rules you can combine different cells to produce five clear, grammatically correct sentences.

Solution:
a. Computer is used for using PowerPoint.b. Computer is also used for composing a document.c. Mobile phone is used for speaking with others.d. Modern technology isn't always safe for us.e. We have to ensure the safe use of modern technology.

Explanation:
Use the verb form that agrees with the subject: singular nouns take "is" (or "has to"/"must"), plurals take "are", and negatives use "isn't"/"aren't".  
"Used for" is followed by a gerund (verb+ing) to show purpose, e.g. "is used for composing a document" or "is used for making PowerPoint presentations."  
When expressing obligation, use "have to" correctly (for uncountable singular "modern technology" say "has to be always safe" or better "must always be safe"), and use a subject + modal to form commands like "We must ensure the safe use of modern technology."
