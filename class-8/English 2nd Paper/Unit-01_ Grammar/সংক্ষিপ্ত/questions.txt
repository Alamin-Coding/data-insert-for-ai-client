Question:
mustafiz said hurry up we must have to leave this horrible place now

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Mustafiz said, “Hurry up! We must leave this horrible place now.”

Explanation:
Correct: Mustafiz said, "Hurry up! We must leave this horrible place now." This fixes capitalization of the name, encloses the spoken words in quotation marks with appropriate punctuation (comma after said and an exclamation mark for urgency), and removes the redundant phrase "must have to" by using just "must."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
“What can I teach you?” asked Nasiruddin. “We don’t know,” replied the students.

Explanation:
Correct: "What can I teach you?" asked Nasiruddin. "We don't know," replied the students.  
This is correct because direct speech goes in quotation marks with the first word (and "I") capitalized, the question mark stays inside the quote, and a comma is used before the reporting verb when the quote continues into a tag.
