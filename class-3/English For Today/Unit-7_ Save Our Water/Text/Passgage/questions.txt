Question:
Water is called life. All humans, animals and plants need water to live. Oceans, rivers, rain and ponds are the main sources of water. We need water every day. We use water for drinking, cooking, bathing and cleaning. Animals drink water every day. Plants and trees also take water from the soil for their growth. The farmers use water to grow crops. So, we cannot live without water.

Sometimes, we do not get clean water for our everyday use. We pollute the water sources. It degrades the quality of water. Polluted water is also dangerous for our life. So, we must save water from pollution. We should not throw any rubbish, plastics, etc. into ponds, rivers and oceans. We must keep the rubbish in a fixed place.
