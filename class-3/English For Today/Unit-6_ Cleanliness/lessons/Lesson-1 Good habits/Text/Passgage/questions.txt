Question:
Little boy Nusair loves to play with his friends. He enjoys playing in the field. Sometimes, he comes back home with dirty clothes and shoes.

Nusair's mother is Jesmin Akter. One day, she notices some dirt under Nusair's fingernails. She tells him, "There are germs in the dirt. Don't touch your mouth, nose or eyes with dirty hands. Dirt can make you sick. So, wash your hands properly to clean the germs."

Nusair does not know how to wash his hands properly. His mother shows him how to clean hands with soap and water. She then tells Nusair, "Always wash your hands before eating and after playing." From that day, Nusair never forgets to wash his hands regularly. This good habit makes him healthy.
