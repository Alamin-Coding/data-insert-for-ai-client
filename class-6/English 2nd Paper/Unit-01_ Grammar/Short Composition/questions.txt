Question:
Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a type of technology that allows machines or programs to do tasks that normally need a human brain. Al can learn, think, and solve problems just like humans. There are two types of Al: weak Al and strong AI. Weak Al does simple tasks, like answering questions or playing music. Strong Al is more advanced and can think and make decisions like a human.
AI is used in many ways. It helps people in offices to do their work faster and better. In banks, Al can predict risks and help earn money. It is also used in medicine to help doctors find problems in the body. Al makes technology in airplanes and space better. It helps make homes and offices safer by controlling alarms and security cameras. Al even helps us communicate with people far away through online meetings.
However, Al has some drawbacks. It can sometimes spread wrong information on social media. Some people worry that Al might get too smart and replace humans. Again, it can destroy the creativity of humans as they
become fully dependent on it. Al can be very helpful, but we need to use it carefully to make sure it is safe and does not cause harm.

Question:
COVID-19

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
COVID-19

COVID means 'Coronavirus Disease'. Since the disease was first detected in 2019, it is termed 'COVID-19'. It is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes without covering the face. The virus reaches the respiratory system through mouth, nose and eyes.
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, high fever, tiredness, shortness of breath, losing sense of smell, etc. Other symptoms include diarrhoea, sore throat, muscle or joint pain, headache, nausea, etc. COVID-19 can cause death to people who have medical conditions like hypertension, diabetes, heart diseases, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, etc.
There is no specific remedy for COVID-19 yet. So, the physicians around the world give symptomatic treatments to COVID patients. However, a good number of vaccines have already been proved effective against COVID-19. These vaccines can boost up our immune system to fight coronavirus.
Even after the vaccination, we can still be infected by COVID-19 and unknowingly spread it. Therefore, we have to practice respiratory etiquette and personal hygiene strictly to prevent it. Washing hands with soap and water, using hand-sanitizer, wearing mask, covering mouth and nose with elbows or a tissue while sneezing and coughing may reduce the chance of getting or spreading the virus. Moreover, maintaining social distancing and avoiding social gathering can prevent the disease from spreading too fast.
To conclude, COVID-19 pandemic has already greatly affected millions of people worldwide, either socially, economically or psychologically. Still, we are hopeful and continuously fighting against it in every possible way.

Question:
A Journey by Train

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A Journey by Train

A journey is always pleasure to all. Similarly, a journey by train is especially pleasant for everyone. It is because a journey by train is safe and comfortable. Whenever, I get a chance to have a journey by train, I never miss it. Last month, I enjoyed a journey by train with my family from Dhaka to Chattogram. We went there to attend the wedding ceremony of my cousin. It was certainly one of the most enjoyable journeys in my life.
On the fixed day, we left home early in the morning and went to Kamlapur Railway Station. The station was very crowded and noisy. We bought tickets and got into the train. I managed my seat beside the window. Suddenly, the train blew its whistle and I jumped. Then the train started.
At first, the train moved slowly. Then it moved in full speed towards Chattogram. It seemed to me that the trees, houses, people and stations all went quickly back to Dhaka. The rhythmic sounds and jerking of the train made me very excited. I wanted to put my head out of the train window, but my parents did not let me do that. Fresh wind began to enter into our compartment. I looked through the window and saw the beautiful sights. The paddy fields and other trees were very beautiful to look at. They were tossing their heads in the breeze. Suddenly, the train rushed forward crossing a bridge. I saw some sailing boats in the river. Sometimes, our train moved through open fields. I saw the farmers working in the fields and some children were playing cricket. All these gave me new and exciting experiences.
Our compartment was crowded. There was no vacant seat. Some of the passengers were talking on various topics. Some were reading newspapers or magazines. Some were sleeping. On the other hand, sometimes, hawkers came with various items. Our train touched at a few big and small stations. We bought boiled eggs, bananas and green coconuts. Finally, when we were into Chattogram, we saw many hills.
At last, we reached the destination safe and sound at 4 p.m. By making this journey by train, I got much enjoyment which I can never forget. I wish I could make it again and again.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Graffiti: Art as Protest in the July Revolution

Graffiti is a type of art created in public places like walls, buildings, and streets. It often carries important messages, such as opinions or protests against unfair issues. Graffiti helps people express their feelings and ideas in creative ways.
During the July Revolution of 2024, graffiti became a powerful tool for protest. As part of the protest, students painted a mural with the words, &quot;Who will bring justice for the murder of martyr Abu Sayeed?&quot; Although the graffiti was erased the next morning, it left a strong impact.
After the fall of the dictatorial government on 5 August 2024, graffiti spread across the nation. Students painted walls to honor martyrs and support the July revolution. Graffiti carried slogans like &quot;Lakho shahider rokte kena, deshta karo baper na!&quot; Walls in Dhaka were filled with symbols like clenched fists and the rising sun. Graffiti gives freedom of speech and brings attention to ignored issues. Students, artists, and even rickshaw pullers joined together. Donations helped fund the efforts. Apparently, graffiti has become the voice of the people, spreading hope and unity.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A Journey by Boat

A journey has always been a source of pleasure to me. But a journey by boat is more interesting to me than any other journey. Bangladesh is a land of rivers. So, it is easy to enjoy a journey by boat here.
During the last autumn vacation, our school was closed. It was a suitable time for me to have a journey. That time my cousin invited me. It was much easier to reach my cousins house by boat. So, I decided to make the journey by boat. I proposed some of my friends to join me to make the journey more interesting. Fortunately two of my friends accepted my proposal and accompanied me. It was a ten-kilometre journey. We hired a boat. We started at 4 p.m. Two boatmen steered the boat smoothly. They were very expert. The weather was calm and quiet. Gentle breeze was pushing the soil. So, the journey was very nice and enjoyable. It took two hours to reach our destination. During the journey, we had a lot of enjoyment. The boat was dancing on the small waves and it thrilled me much. We also enjoyed a 'Bhatiali' song sung by the boatmen. We were delighted at the sight on both the banks of the river. Moreover, some fishermen were catching fish. Many children were bathing and swimming in the river. I saw some young girls and women taking water from the river. When the sun was setting in the western horizon, the scene gave us a nice view and it increased our joy.
It was really a nice journey and I will ever remember this journey. As I had taken the pictures of beautiful sceneries, so whenever I miss the journey I see those photos. I wish I could make a journey like this once again.

Question:
Value of Time

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Value of Time

Time is valuable. From my perspective time is money, energy and prosperity. He who evaluates time is sure to succeed in life. He who does not evaluate it always lags behind.
Time only moves forward. It knows how to create something new. The great men of the world made a good use of their time and became successful in life.
Moreover, the importance of time can never be written in words only. Time is such a medium through which we can make our life successful and glorious. The great achievements of the world have been possible for the good use of time. If time is not properly valued, none can achieve success.
In addition, he who does not make the good use of time always remains unsuccessful and poor. The history of the downfall of any person says that misuse of time is the result of his destruction. None should waste his time. Every single moment of our life should be used properly.
Furthermore, proper use of time is very essential. One can easily reach the desired goal of life only when one gives due value to time. All the successful men in the world have made proper use of time. So, we should follow them to be successful in our life.
Hence, it is time which never waits for anybody. It only knows how to move forward. If one works giving proper value to it, one must be successful. Time itself is not selfish but it is always on motion. We must be careful of making good use of time and bear in mind that it does not wait for anybody.
The importance of time should properly be realized by all of us. If time is not properly evaluated, we can never reach our goal of prosperity.

Question:
Floods in Bangladesh

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Floods in Bangladesh

Flood means overflow of water. Flood is a natural calamity which occurs in Bangladesh almost every year. When it takes place seriously, it weakens our hopes of prosperity. It is like a curse of nature on us.
Heavy rainfall often causes flood. Blockage of water also causes flood. In our country, flood is caused mainly due to heavy rainfall, blockage of water and release of too much water from the Farakka Barrage. On the other hand, flood may also be caused by-cyclones, tidal bores or melting of ice of mountains.
Floods cause us great havocs and sufferings to millions of people. Houses and cattle are washed away. Crops are damaged and many lives and properties are lost. Streets and roads go under water. Hence people cannot go from one place to another, It makes rich people poor and poor people distressed.
The after effect of flood is very dangerous. Diarrhoea and other water-borne diseases break out after a flood. There is a scarcity of food and pure drinking water all around. The areas affected by flood become muddy and unhealthy. The prices of all daily necessary goods go up.
The government tries to take proper steps for the sufferers. Some voluntary organisations and NGOs help the affected people. They provide relief goods, medicines, etc, to them.
It is not an easy task to check floods. Firstly, drainage system should be improved. Secondly, river beds should be dredged. Thirdly, a well planned irrigation system should be introduced. Fourthly, we should build our houses on high land.
Flood has some good sides too. Silt scatters on lands and it makes the soil fertile. Sometimes various kinds of crops grow more on these fertile lands. Then we get bumper crops.
Flood is usually a great curse to us. It destroys our hopes and aspirations. So, long term measures should be taken to control floods.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
My Favourite Hobby

Hobby means one's favourite occupation. It is usually done during leisure. It does not give one money, but gives much pleasure. Every man has his own favourite hobby.
There are many kinds of hobbies like singing, painting, reading, stamp collecting, coin collecting, angling, gardening and so on. I have my own favourite hobby. It is gardening.
I love flowers very much. So, I have made a flower garden. It is in front of our house. I have planted the seedlings of roses, jasmines, bella, sun-flowers and many other seasonal flowers. Every morning I water the plants, till the soil and take care of the plants. In the evening, I water them again. On holidays, I pass a longer period there than the usual days..I have put a bamboo-made fence around my garden. For this, cattle and other animals cannot enter into it.
My hobby is favourite to me because it keeps me cheerful. When I am bored with my studies or other works, I go into my garden. The pleasant sight of my garden and the sweet scent of the flowers remove my boredom. However, it is a great source of joy and recreation for me. I think, no other hobby can give me as much joy as this one.
My hobby is very beneficial to me. Before I made this garden, I was a sickly boy. I had lost my appetite and became very weak. But when I started this garden and worked in it, my health improved gradually. Now I am quite healthier than before. Besides this, I grow vegetables in a corner of the garden. Moreover, it saves a lot of family expenses.
A hobby is necessary in every man's life. But we must not pass much of our time in our hobbies. We must do our main jobs first and then we should pass our leisure time in our hobbies.

The Season I Like Most

Or, The Spring in Bangladesh

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Season I Like Most
Or, The Spring in Bangladesh

There are six seasons in Bangladesh. The spring is one of them. It is the best, the loveliest and the most charming of all the seasons. The Bangla months of Falgun and Chaitra make this season. I like this season most. Among the seasons, the spring occupies a very high position. To me the winter is very cold, dull and lifeless. In summer, the scorching sun, hot days and nights make life miserable. The heavy rain and frequent floods in the rainy season bring great sufferings for us. The autumn and the late autumn have more or less disadvantages of the rainy season and the winter respectively. But the spring has none of the inconveniences of these seasons. Coming after winter, it captivates the hearts of all. Surprisingly with the arrival of the spring, nature puts on a lively look. Everything of nature looks fresh. The sky looks clear and blue, trees put forth new leaves, flowers of charming colours and scent bloom in trees. Bees and butterflies hum and fly from one flower to another. During this season, gentle breeze begins to blow. Sweet twitters of birds are heard. The melodious notes of the cuckoo please our ears. All these charming and pleasing sights and sounds have a positive influence on our mind. Everywhere there is joy and mirth. People enjoy a better health. They are happier in this season. Besides, various kinds of vegetables and fruits are also available in this time.
​​​​​​​However, the season lasts for a very short period. During this season, some people suffer from some diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, chicken-pox. Pox is a common disease in this season.
In spite of its few disadvantages, its advantages are more. Truly speaking, its actual stay in Bangladesh is not more than two or three weeks. Perhaps its short stay has made it dearer to us. For all these reasons, I like spring most.

Question:
Anti-discrimination Student Movement

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Anti-discrimination Student Movement

The Anti-discrimination Student Movement was a big incident in Bangladesh in July 2024. It started as the students were unhappy about the government's quota system for jobs.
In June 2024, the High Court announced a 30% quota for the children of freedom fighters in government jobs. There were already quotas for other groups, which meant only 44% of jobs were left for general applicants. The students thought this was unfair and wanted a change.
This protest was not the first one. Similar protests took place, in 2013 and 2018. This time, the students took to the streets again. They blocked roads and became very serious about the protest. The protests grew stronger gradually. On July 15, some armed people attacked the students, injuring many. The protests became more violent and many students were hurt. The students then turned their protest against the government. On August 3, they made one demand: the government must resign.
Finally, on August 5, the Prime Minister stepped down. The students' unity and hard work helped bring down the government and changed the future of Bangladesh.

Man aims for his future. An aimless life is like a boat without a rudder that can never reach its destination. So, to succeed in life one should have a future plan from one's early life. This is called the aim in life. So, it can be said that one's aim is one's future plan for his life.
Different people may have different aims in life. Some want money, some want reputation. Again there are some people who like to do something noble. Like others, I also have an aim in life.

It is because a teacher can lead the nation to the highest stage of prosperity if he can properly teach the students with his ideal.
I want to serve the nation through proper teaching. Illiteracy is the vital cause of our poverty. If our students are properly educated, they can alleviate our poverty. By being a teacher, I am determined to serve the nation. In order to fulfill my future plan, I must acquire some degrees. After passing, SSC and HSC Examination, I will get myself admitted into the Honour's class. I will try my level best to get myself admitted into a good and reputed university.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A Journey by Bus
Or, A Journey I Have Recently Enjoyed

A journey by bus is a very common affair in our country. Whenever I get a chance of a journey by bus, I do not miss it. It is always a fun for me.
A few days ago, I got such a chance of bus journey. The journey was from Dhaka to Sylhet. I was going to my uncles house in Sylhet during the last winter (or, summer, or, Ramadan) vacation.
I along with my elder brother went to Sayedabad Bus Terminal early in the morning. We bought two tickets for a Dhaka-Sylhet bound express bus. We took our seats. My seat was beside a window. Beforehand, we had taken some light tiffin and some drinking water with us.
The bus started for Sylhet at 7 a.m. At first, the bus left Dhaka slowly. But after some time, it was running fast. We reached Meghna Ferry Ghat at 8 a.m. We all got down from the bus and got on a ferry. The ferry moved smoothly across the river. It took about half an hour to cross the river. At about 11 a.m, our bus reached Habiganj road. On this road, we were about to face a collision. Our driver was trying to overtake another bus at a high speed. But luckily we escaped from the accident. Then the bus was running speedily and we were enjoying music from the cassette player of the bus.
During the journey, I looked through the window and enjoyed many charming sights of nature. I saw beautiful green trees, orchards, meadows, etc, on each side of the road. Many farmers were working in road-side fields. Besides, children were playing here and there. I also saw many bazars, pice villages, rivers, canals, bridges and so on. I enjoyed all these things. At the ferry ghat, the beauty of the Meghna gave me much pleasure.
Thus moving, our bus reached Sylhet safely at 2 p.m. We got down from the bus. We found our uncle waiting for us at Sylhet Bus Terminal. He became very glad to see us and received us cordially.
The journey I made was long but I enjoyed every bit of it. It gave me much pleasure and some new experiences. I shall never forget the sweet memories of this journey as it was the first longest journey in my life.

Question:
Discipline

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Discipline

Discipline means obedience to rules. It is necessary for achieving success in life. It also means obedience to orderly conduct.
Actually everything in the universe is conducted by discipline. Breach of discipline brings downfall. In the world nothing is above discipline. If every man does as he likes, then there will be chaos in the society. So, the
importance of discipline is very great. We should follow discipline to be successful in the battle of life. In the army discipline is essential. Everyone in the army has to lead a strictly disciplined life. If the soldiers do not obey orders, they become at once a mere rabble unfit to do their duty. A small group of military is more capable to control thousands of mobs than a large group of police. It is because the former can act in a disciplined way, while the latter cannot do so.
Similarly, discipline is necessary in student life because by learning discipline a student can be a successful citizen in future. The students who learn discipline from their earlylife can tackle any problem in future. So, learning discipline in student life is a must.
The planets move in discipline. They are bound to obey rules and regulations of the universe. As a result, there is no possibility of clash and conflict among them. Thus, discipline can be learnt from the disciplined movement of the planets.
Likewise, the institution that follows discipline runs well. But it fails when it is without discipline. A good institution follows rules and regulations strictly.
Hence, discipline brings success for one who follows it. The great men of the world followed discipline strictly. They never did anything against rules and regulations. All the time they advised the next generation to be disciplined, dutiful, sincere, punctual and gentle.
Discipline is development. Absence of discipline causes downfall in every walk of life. Discipline draws a sharp line of distinction between men and beasts. So, we should be careful of the importance of discipline in our life.

The prize giving ceremony of our school is very pleasant. It is arranged to distribute prizes among the winners of different events of games, sports, art and culture.
In February last, the prize giving ceremony of our school was held. Before the function, everything within the school was beautifully decorated. The DC of our district was invited as the chief guest in the function.
Meanwhile, the function started with our national anthem and a nice physical display. The BNCC of our school played a good role in opening the ceremony.
The DC arrived at the school compound in time. Our headteacher and all other teachers received him cordially. He took the chair in the midst of cheers and claps. The function started at 3 pm. The headteacher read out the annual reports of the school. We all listened to it. Some special persons also attended the function.
The DC gave away prizes among the students. One of our teachers called out the names of the prize winners one by one. Then the winners shook hands with the chief guest and other important persons.
After the distribution of the prizes, the chief guest gave his short speech with advice to the students, teachers and the guardians. Last of all, the president of the function declared the end of the function with thanks to all. The prize giving ceremony of our school was really an enjoyable function.

My First Day at School

My education started at my early age. My mother taught me at home but it was informal. My formal education started six in a primary school. It is an ever lasting memory of my life.
One day, my mother told me that I was going to start school from the next day. I was very happy and excited. I could not think of anything else and at night I could not sleep.
The next morning, she made me bathe. I put on a full-sleeve white shirt, black half-pant and white keds. Before starting for the school, I felt very excited. I started for the school with my father. The school was not so far. So, we went on foot.
My father took me to the Headmasters room. Then the headmaster asked my name and I told him. After that, then he pointed to a letter chart and asked me to say some letters. I could say them all. Indeed, my mother taught me to read Bengali and English letters and some easy words at home. The headmaster was pleased at me. He smiled and said that I had done very well. Then he called in a teacher named Mrs. Amin and told her to take
me to the class and look after me.
I said goodbye to my father and went with Mrs. Amin. Mrs. Amin took me to her class. She welcomed me and gave me a seat in the classroom. I felt happy.

In fact, he should also render some services to his society and country. He should make the illiterate literate. He can make the farmers aware of the modern methods of cultivation. In population control, he can play an important role.
A student must obey and honour his parents. When they are sick, helpless or old, he must serve them. Hence, he should also be obedient to his teachers and other superiors.
A student must not waste his time and energy. So, he must possess a sound health by taking regular physical exercise, taking part in games and sports. Moreover, he must always avoid evil company.
Besides, a student may have the knowledge of politics but he must not take part in active politics. Actually it is because many political parties and their unethical leaders use them only for their selfish interest.

Solution:
Population Problem in Bangladesh

Population is an asset to a country. But it becomes a problem for a country when the country fails to provide them with employment opportunity and the basic needs of life. Bangladesh is an overpopulated country. Her population is growing rapidly. As a result, population has now become a great problem for Bangladesh.
Unfortunately the present growth rate of population in Bangladesh is 1.37%. It has made the country a crowded land. If this present growth rate continues, the population of Bangladesh will be doubled soon. Thus the growth of population is a challenge to our existence as a nation.
There are many causes of over population. Illiteracy is one of the main causes. Moreover, ignorance, early marriage, some social and religious superstitions, unemployment of rural women, etc. are responsible for over population.
Population explosion is destroying all the efforts for our development. Our population is increasing, but the land is fixed. Other facilities for living are not increasing. So, the problems of shelter, food, clothing, medical treatment, housing, education, entertainment, etc. are increasing. However, it also causes various disturbances in the society. Because of it, everything becomes difficult. So, various socio-economic and political problems are being created for population explosion in Bangladesh.
So, we must come forward to control our population. We should adopt family planning measures effectively. Each family must live in a planned way. No family should have more than two children. Early marriage must be banned. Mass education should be increased, as an educated person can realize the problem of over population. People should be made aware of the social and religious superstitions.
Over population has become one of the most important concerns for our country. It must be checked as early as possible. All should come forward to solve the problem of over population.
