Jashore Zilla School, Jahore

Subject: Application for buying updated books for the school library.

Sir,
I on behalf of the students of your school, have the honour to state that we are suffering greatly for want of updated books in our school library. Ours is a famous school and our school library is rich and spacious.

My dear Megha,
Take my cordial love. I hope you're passing happy days. In your last letter, you wanted to know about the picnic which I enjoyed last Friday with my school friends. Now, I'm going to describe it.
We went to Sonargaon in Narayanganj. Actually it is famous for its historical importance. There are several ancient buildings, gardens, dresses, arms, sculptures, earthen-wares, straw-made houses, Nakshi Kantha, etc. at Sonargaon. Moreover, a large pond adds to the beauty of the place. We went there by a private car and took our breakfast there. At noon, we enjoyed a grand feast. We had much fun and cut jokes. Besides we also moved around the place and saw many beautiful things. We took many photographs with our teachers and friends. The natural scenery attracted us very much. Before evening, we returned to Dhaka. All of us really enjoyed the picnic very much.
No more today. With best love to you and regards to your parents.

Yours ever,
Riya

Subject: A terrible fire incident
My Dear Bilal,
I hope you are doing well. I want to share a scary experience I had last week.
I was with some friends at a restaurant in Baily Road. While we were eating, we suddenly heard a loud noise from the kitchen. Soon, smoke filled the dining area and we realized there was a fire. Everyone panicked, but the staff tried to help us get out quickly. It was hard to see because of the smoke. Some people were very scared, while others stayed calm and helped. I grabbed my things and covered my mouth with my jacket to avoid the smoke. We went outside and saw the flames spreading. The fire service arrived quickly and worked hard to control the fire. Sadly, 46 people were died and many were injured. It was a terrifying experience that I will never forget.
Take care and stay safe.
Yours ever,
Sohan

Dear Trudeau,
How are you, friend? I hope you are doing well. I want to share some exciting news that has made my life much easier. Our city now has a metro rail, and I use it every day. It has saved me a lot of time and trouble. Before, my journey to school was stressful and slow because of traffic jams. It took more than an hour by bus or auto-rickshaw. Now, the metro rail takes only 20 minutes! The metro rail is fast, comfortable, and affordable. It runs on time. So, I dont worry about being late. I can relax and enjoy the ride instead of being stuck in traffic. It also
gives me more time to get ready in the morning. This new metro rail has made my life better. When you visit, we can take a ride together.

I've fixed an aim it my life and it's to be a physician (or doctor). I'll take science group in Class 9. After my SSC Examination, I'll study in the same group in the HSC course. After passing the HSC Examination with a good result, l intend to get myself admitted into a medical college for an MBBS degree. The profession of a physician is very noble and humanitarian. In my village, there is no qualified physician. The villagers suffer from various diseases and face premature deaths. Besides, my parents want that I should be a physician. After completing MBBS course, I'll come back to my village and serve my villagers. I'll take no fee from the poor. I've also a great dream to establish a small hospital in the village. There will exist all modern medical facilities in it. Here the poor patients will be treated without any fee and they will get medicines at half of the price. I earnestly pray to Allah for fulfilling my noble aim and I'm also working hard to reach my goal.
No more today. Please convey my best regards to your parents and love to Tunu.

Dear Arif,
Take my love.
It's not pleasant to know that you're suffering from continuous ill health. May be you are not serious about regular physical exercise. To keep sound health we should do regular physical exercise. It keeps our body and mind fresh. It also enhances our physical immunity. Any sorts of sports, running, swimming and walking regularly can be good physical exercise. So, I'll have a request for you, when you'll be recovered, please do regular physical exercise.
Wish your speedy recovery.

With due respect, I, on behalf of the students of class VI, would like to state that our school has a common room for the students. This room is spacious and airy but it lacks modern facilities. There are no fans and drinking water supply in the room. Moreover, very few sitting arrangements have been made. The condition becomes serious in the hot summer days.

Mohammadpur, Dhaka
23 March 2025

Dear,
Hope you're fine. I am fine too. I've just received your letter in which you wanted to know when and how to wear a mask. I'm now writing about this.
You know the best way to prevent respiratory diseases is to follow the rules of hygiene strictly. For this, you have to wear a mask while going out or meeting someone. You have to wash your hands before putting on your mask. You should put the mask over your nose and mouth and then secure it under your chin. Make sure you can breathe easily. Don't touch or adjust your mask frequently without cleaning your hands. If possible, don't use a mask twice.
No more today. I hope you'll find the instructions useful and follow them accordingly.

Yours ever,
Sarjis

The name of my village is Ratanpur. It's situated beside a small river. It's about three kilometres long and about two kilometres wide with a lot of green plants and trees. About two thousand people live in our village. Most of them are farmers. There are also some service-holders, teachers, businessmen, fishermen and three qualified doctors in our village. Moreover, there are a high school, two primary schools, three mosques and a market in our village. About 85% inhabitants of our village are Muslims and the rest are Hindus. Our fields are full of green crops. They are very nice to look at. The fishermen fish in the river with their nets and boats. It is very interesting to watch their fishing. Sometimes, we enjoy boat-journey in the river. The fresh air from the river gives us much pleasure. There is no quarrel or clash in our village. So, we all are living here quite happily. I invite you to visit our beautiful country as well as our village whenever you get an opportunity.
No more toady. Write me again.

Yours ever,
Wasif

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
130/B, College Road, Bogura
5 August 2025

Dear Ritu,
I hope you are doing well in your studies. I am worried about the dengue outbreak in the country. Please be careful.
Do you know the symptoms of dengue fever? Let me explain. Symptoms appear 4-6 days after infection and last up to 10 days. These include high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, skin rash and mild bleeding. In severe cases, it can cause massive bleeding, shock or even death. There is no specific cure for dengue. Doctors suggest rest, drinking lots of fluids, and taking paracetamol.
Since there is no proper cure, we must prevent it. To avoid mosquito bites, use repellents and mosquito nets while sleeping. Reduce mosquito breeding by keeping your surroundings clean and avoiding stagnant water. Take care of yourself and your family.

Your loving sister,
Tammi

Subject: The Padma Bridge
My Dear Bilal,
I've just received your email. I am happy that you have learned about the Padma Bridge. Yes, it is the largest bridge in Bangladesh.
The Padma Bridge is a dream project for Bangladesh. It is a road-rail bridge over the Padma River, one of the largest rivers in the country. The bridge connects Louhajong, Munshiganj, to Shariatpur and Madaripur. It links the south-west of the country to the northern and eastern regions. Construction began on 7 December 2014 by China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Company Limited. The bridge was finally inaugurated on 25 June 2022. Bangladesh built the bridge using its own funds. Along the bridge, there are utilities like gas lines, telephone lines, optical fiber and high-voltage electric lines. The bridge is expected to increase Bangladesh's GDP by 1.2 percent. You can find more details on the internet.

Subject: Make sure you never start smoking
Hi Abid,
How're you? I am fine.
I'm going to discuss about a critical problem of Bangladeshi young generation. You shall find boys of our age getting into the habit of smoking nowadays. It's injurious to health. It can create various types of dangerous diseases. But, unfortunately our people are not conscious about that. Since you're a very intelligent guy, I hope you will never form this bad habit. If you can, please try to make others aware of the dangers of smoking.
Have a nice time.
Yours ever,
Roktim
