Question:
What is the mixing process used for the egg mixture?

Options:
a. Blend
b. Beat
c. Whip
d. Stir


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the intended effect — an egg mixture is usually made uniform and slightly aerated by vigorous motion so yolk and white are fully combined.  
Step 2: Match actions to effects — "beat" means to rapidly mix with a fork or whisk to homogenize and incorporate some air, which is exactly what is done for an egg mixture.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options — "blend" implies using a blender or combining different ingredients smoothly, "whip" is more vigorous and used to create much more volume (e.g., whipped cream or egg whites), and "stir" is gentle and won’t fully combine or aerate eggs.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: Beat.

Question:
Students are advised to be cautious with __________.

Options:
a. cold water
b. sharp knives
c. frozen food
d. soft bread


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the item with the highest immediate safety risk — sharp knives can cause cuts and serious injuries if mishandled.  
Step 2: Compare other options: cold water is generally safe, frozen food may pose food-safety issues but not immediate physical harm in normal handling, and soft bread has minimal risk.  
Therefore the best choice is (b) sharp knives, since students are commonly advised to be cautious with objects that can cause physical injury.

Describe the final step of making an egg sandwich.

Options:


Correct Answer: Place the last slice of bread on top and serve.

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে ডিম সেদ্ধ বা ভাজা করে নিন এবং রুটির নিচের স্লাইসে মাখন/মেয়োনেজ বা পছন্দের সস মাখান। এরপর ডিম ও অন্যান্য উপকরণ (লেটুস, টমেটো ইত্যাদি) সাজান। শেষ ধাপে উপরের দিকে রুটির শেষ স্লাইসটি রাখুন এবং স্যান্ডউইচটি পরিবেশন করুন — এটাই সঠিক উত্তর কারণ এটা স্যান্ডউইচের গঠন সম্পূর্ণ করে এবং খাওয়ার সময় উপকরণ ঝরে পড়া থেকে রোধ করে; অন্য বিকল্পগুলো (যেমন উপরের স্লাইস না দেওয়া বা কেটে নেওয়া আগে) স্ট্রাকচারিক ও পরিষ্কারতার কারণে ভুল।

Question:
What is essential to do with eggs before cooking for an omelette?

Options:
a. Fry
b. Pour
c. Break
d. Boil


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: To make an omelette you must get the egg contents out of the shell so they can be mixed and cooked — that requires breaking the shell.  
Step 2: Among the options, c (Break) is the action that accomplishes this, so it is essential before cooking.  
Explanation: Frying or pouring come after the egg is opened and mixed, and boiling is a different cooking method, so they are not the necessary first step. Therefore the correct answer is c.

Question:
To prepare the sandwich, only one type of filling is recommended.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the statement — it claims that preparing the sandwich requires using only one type of filling.  
Step 2: Evaluate against typical sandwich practice and the given instructions: sandwiches commonly allow or recommend combinations of fillings (e.g., cheese, vegetables, meats) for flavor and nutrition, so there is no strict requirement of a single filling.  
Step 3: Conclude — the statement is false, so option b is correct. Option a (True) is incorrect because it wrongly imposes a single-filling restriction that standard recipes do not require.

Question:
The omelette mixture is poured into a __________ after heating oil.

Options:
a. dish
b. pan
c. bowl
d. cup


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Heat oil in a cooking pan on the stove until hot.  
Step 2: Pour the omelette mixture into the heated pan so it can cook evenly on the hot surface.  
Explanation: A pan is the correct choice because it provides a flat, heated surface for frying and allows even cooking; a dish or bowl is for mixing or serving and a cup is too small and unsuitable for cooking.

Question:
What action should you take after cooking the omelette?

Options:


Correct Answer: Turn it in folds with a flat spoon

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: After the omelette surface is mostly set but still slightly moist, stop stirring and let the bottom finish cooking so it holds together.  
Step 2: Use a flat spoon to gently lift and fold the omelette into halves or thirds — turning it in folds preserves the shape, traps steam to finish cooking the center, and prevents tearing.  
Reasoning: Folding with a flat spoon applies gentle, even pressure and control; completely flipping or vigorously stirring would break the omelette or turn it into scrambled eggs, and removing it without folding can leave the center undercooked.

Question:
What is a suggested serving option for the sandwich?

Options:
a. Serve warm
b. Serve cold
c. Cut into two halves
d. Grill before serving


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question — it asks for a suggested serving option for the sandwich and gives four choices.  
Step 2: Evaluate each option: serving warm or cold and grilling are about temperature/preparation, while cutting into two halves is a common serving suggestion that improves portioning and ease of eating.  
Step 3: Choose option (c) — "Cut into two halves" — because it makes the sandwich easier to handle and share; the other choices describe temperature or cooking steps rather than a typical serving presentation.

Question:
Two slices of __________ should be placed on the serving plate.

Options:
a. bread
b. cheese
c. vegetables
d. egg


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the phrase "Two slices of ___ should be placed on the serving plate" — the word "slices" most commonly pairs with "bread" in serving contexts (e.g., two slices of bread for a sandwich or toast).  
Step 2: Compare options: while cheese and vegetables can be sliced, the typical instruction for plating two slices refers to bread; "egg" is rarely referred to as "two slices."  
Therefore the correct choice is a) bread.

Question:
What can you add on top of noodles if you want?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the question: it asks what you can add on top of noodles if you want — that means a typical, optional topping.
2. Common and widely used noodle toppings include vegetables, meats, and eggs; an egg (fried, poached, or soft‑boiled) is especially common because it adds flavor, richness and protein and pairs well with noodles.
3. Therefore the correct answer is “an egg.” Other options would be incorrect if they are not typical food toppings or do not complement noodles (for example non‑food items or flavors that clash).

Solution:
Step 1: Identify that cooking instructions are directives that tell someone to perform tasks, so they are typically written using verbs or imperative forms (for example: "chop", "stir", "bake").  
Step 2: Since these are action words directing actions, the statement is true.  
Therefore the correct answer is a. Option b is incorrect because it denies the evident use of action/imperative verbs in recipes.

You do not need to add any spices when making noodles.

Options:
a. True

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Interpret the statement: it claims that adding spices is unnecessary when making noodles.
2. Evaluate with facts: most noodle preparations (including instant noodles) include a seasoning packet or rely on added spices/sauces to provide flavor; plain cooked noodles without any seasoning are typically bland.
3. Conclusion: the statement is false, so the correct choice is b (False). Option a (True) is incorrect because it ignores the common need for seasoning to make noodles palatable.

Question:
Cooking oil should be heated before adding the __________.

Options:
a. mix
b. water
c. bread
d. noodles


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Heating oil is done to reach a cooking temperature so ingredients brown or fry quickly and to prevent sticking.  
Step 2: Check each option — adding [water] to hot oil causes dangerous splattering, [bread] is usually toasted or baked rather than dropped into hot oil, [noodles] are typically boiled in water, whereas a [mix] (e.g., vegetables, spices, batter) is what you generally add to hot oil to fry.  
Therefore the correct choice is a: mix, because frying a mixture requires hot oil for proper cooking while the other options are unsuitable or unsafe.

Question:
How long should the mixture be left in the pan for the omelette?

Options:


Correct Answer: 2 to 3 minutes

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: After pouring the omelette mixture into a preheated pan on medium heat, let the edges set and the center begin to thicken — this typically takes about [math]2\ \text{minutes}[/math].  
Step 2: When the top is slightly moist but not runny, you can fold or flip; the usual time to reach this stage is [math]2\text{ to }3\ \text{minutes}[/math], so that is the correct choice.  
Reasoning: A much shorter time (e.g., under a minute) leaves the omelette undercooked, while a much longer time (e.g., 5+ minutes) overcooks and makes it rubbery, so the optimal interval is [math]2\text{–}3\ \text{minutes}[/math].

Question:
When cooking the egg, what should you do as it thickens?

Options:
a. Leave it alone
b. Mix it constantly
c. Turn it in folds
d. Add more ingredients


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: As the egg begins to thicken, watch for soft curds forming and the surface losing gloss.
Step 2: Use a spatula to gently turn the egg in folds (fold from the edges toward the center) so it cooks evenly and keeps a tender texture.
Reasoning: Folding prevents the bottom from overcooking while preserving soft curds; constant stirring breaks the curds into very small pieces and can make the egg dry, leaving it alone risks uneven cooking or sticking, and adding more ingredients at this stage can interfere with texture and timing.

d. the bottom layer


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the typical order when assembling a sandwich or pizza — bread, cheese, then toppings like sliced vegetables.  
Step 2: Compare options: option a places slices of vegetables on top of the cheese, which matches the usual practice.  
Step 3: Conclude that option a is correct because vegetables are normally layered above the cheese for visibility and even cooking; option b (under the bread) and option d (the bottom layer) are impractical, and option c (the side of the plate) does not place the vegetables on the sandwich/pizza.

Solution:

Step 2: Reasoning: spices enhance taste and aroma while vegetables add texture, color and nutrients, so this choice best completes the preparation.  
Other options (for example, just boiling in water, adding only oil, or not seasoning) fail to improve both taste and nutritional value, so they are less appropriate.

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Think about what you normally do right after assembling a sandwich by adding vegetables — common finishing actions are serving, slicing, or wrapping.  
Step 2: Evaluate the options: "cook" is unlikely because sandwiches are usually cooked before or not at all; "freeze" and "discard" are not typical immediate next steps. "Cut" is the usual action (to make portions or easier eating) after adding the ingredients.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: cut.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: To prepare an omelette the eggs and any added milk or seasoning should be beaten in a bowl before cooking.

Options a (baked), c (fried) and d (boiled) are cooking methods, not the preparatory action; hence the correct answer is b: beaten.

Step 3: Conclude that the statement is true, so option (a) True is correct. Option (b) False is incorrect because it contradicts the lesson content which explicitly covers two types of food.

Question:
What recipe is being described in the text?

Options:
a. How to make a salad
b. How to make an egg sandwich
c. How to make a fruit smoothie
d. How to bake a cake


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Scan the described actions and ingredients: mentions of cooking or slicing eggs, putting something between slices of bread, spreading butter or mayonnaise point to a sandwich made with egg.  
2. Key steps inferred—prepare the egg (boil/fry), season and spread condiments, place the egg between two slices of bread—match an egg sandwich recipe.  
3. Therefore the correct choice is (b) How to make an egg sandwich.  
4. Other options are unlikely: a salad would emphasize greens and tossing, c a smoothie would mention blending fruit and liquid, and d baking a cake would describe batter and oven time.

Question:
What type of bread is used for making the sandwich?

Options:


Correct Answer: Two slices of bread

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the standard sandwich structure — a sandwich typically has a top and a bottom piece of bread that enclose the filling, i.e., [math]2[/math] pieces.  
Step 2: Match this to the choices: "Two slices of bread" directly describes those two pieces, so it is the correct option.  
Other options (a single slice, a roll, or many slices) are incorrect because they do not provide the typical two-slice enclosure needed for a conventional sandwich.

Question:
What is the surface treatment for the bread slices before adding other ingredients?

Options:
a. Boil
b. Toast
c. Spread butter
d. Deep fry


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question — we need the surface treatment applied to bread slices before adding other ingredients.  
Step 2: Evaluate each option: spreading butter on bread is a common surface treatment because it creates a thin, moist barrier that helps toppings adhere and prevents sogginess while adding flavor.  
Therefore the correct answer is c (Spread butter). Options a (Boil) and d (Deep fry) are inappropriate for bread slices before assembling, and b (Toast) changes texture rather than acting as a surface coating.

b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: পড়তে বলছে যে সব সময় স্যান্ডউইচে থাকা ডিম কাঁচা পরিবেশিত হয় — এটা একটি সার্বজনীন দাবি।  
Step 2: বাস্তবে অনেক সাধারণ স্যান্ডউইচে ডিম রান্না করা হয় (উদাহরণ: ফ্রাইড এগ্র স্যান্ডউইচ, সেদ্ধ ডিম দিয়ে এগ সালাদ স্যান্ডউইচ, অমলেট স্যান্ডউইচ), তাই দাবিটি ভেঙে যায়।  
Step 3: ফলantly, বিবৃতিটি মিথ্যা, তাই সঠিক উত্তর: b (False). অপশন a ভুল কারণ "always"–এর মতো একটি সর্বজনীন দাবি বাস্তবে প্রচুর বিপরীত উদাহরণের দ্বারা প্রমাণিত অসম্ভব।

Question:
For making sandwiches, students can choose a __________ of fillings.

Options:
a. few
b. variety
c. none
d. single


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the sentence: "For making sandwiches, students can choose a __________ of fillings." The structure "a ___ of fillings" requires a noun that naturally forms the phrase "a ___ of [plural noun]".
2. Test the options: "a variety of fillings" is a correct and common collocation meaning many different fillings, whereas "a few of fillings" is ungrammatical (we would say "a few fillings"), "a none of fillings" is incorrect, and "a single of fillings" is not a natural phrase.
3. Therefore the correct choice is b: variety.

Question:
What should you do with the vegetables before preparing them?

Options:


Correct Answer: Wash and dry them

Solution:
Solution: Always wash the vegetables first to remove dirt, bacteria, and pesticide residues; rinsing under running water or soaking briefly is the usual method. After washing, dry them (with a clean cloth or paper towel or by air-drying) so excess water doesn’t dilute dressings, prevent oil splatter when frying, and help seasonings stick. Cutting or cooking without washing/drying can spread contaminants or produce poorer texture and flavor, so "Wash and dry them" is the correct choice.

Options:
a. Carrot
b. Cucumber
c. Potato
d. Pepper


Correct Answer: খ
