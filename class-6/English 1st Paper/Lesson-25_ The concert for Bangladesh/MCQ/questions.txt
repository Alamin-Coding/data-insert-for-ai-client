Question:
Why did Robin read the letter to his mother?

Options:
a. To show off
b. To share his excitement
c. To get help
d. To ask for advice


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Consider the likely motive behind reading a letter aloud to a close family member—people usually read good news aloud to share their feelings.  
Step 2: The best match is option b, "To share his excitement," because reading the letter to his mother implies he wanted her to hear the news and share his emotion.  
Step 3: Other options are less fitting: "To show off" implies boasting without closeness, while "to get help" or "to ask for advice" would be indicated by seeking guidance or questions, which the act of reading for a parent does not necessarily show.

Question:
What did Robin especially appreciate about his visit to the country?

Options:


Correct Answer: Seeing new things and learning to milk a cow.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the sentence(s) in the passage describing Robin’s feelings about the visit—he says he enjoyed “seeing new things” and “learning to milk a cow.”  
Step 2: These two activities are explicitly mentioned as what he appreciated most, so they directly answer the question.  
Therefore the correct choice is: seeing new things and learning to milk a cow.

Question:
In the country, Robin experienced a __________ new world.

Options:
a. Very
b. Totally
c. Somewhat
d. Completely


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: We need an adverb that intensifies "new world" to show Robin's experience was entirely different. Among the choices, "totally" fits the common collocation "a totally new world," meaning an entirely different experience, so option b is correct. "Very" is a weak intensifier for "new world," "somewhat" implies only partly different (contradicting the sense), and "completely" is close in meaning but less idiomatic here than "totally."

Question:
Robin's adventure was limited to the city.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim — "Robin's adventure was limited to the city" asserts that he did not go beyond the city.  
Step 2: Check the passage for evidence: the text describes Robin traveling to areas outside the city (for example visits to the countryside/forest), so his adventure was not confined to the city.  
Conclusion: The claim is false, so the correct answer is b (False). Option a (True) is incorrect because it contradicts the textual evidence showing travel beyond the city.

Question:
What is a key expression used for invitations in the text?

Options:
a. Can you?
b. I prefer you to
c. Would like you to
d. Could you please


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the function asked for — a phrase used for making invitations (a polite way to invite someone).  
Step 2: Compare each option with that function: "Would like you to" expresses a polite invitation or request that someone join or do something, so it fits the invitation purpose.  
Step 3: Eliminate others: "Can you?" and "Could you please" are direct requests asking ability or asking someone to do something (not specifically an invitation), and "I prefer you to" states a preference rather than inviting.  
Therefore the correct answer is (c) Would like you to.

Question:
What did Robin do first when he read the letter?

Options:


Correct Answer: He showed it to his mother.

Solution:
Solution:
1. Step 1: Robin read the contents of the letter and understood its message.  
2. Step 2: His immediate reaction was to show the letter to his mother — this is stated directly in the text, so it is the first thing he did.  
3. Reasoning why other choices are incorrect: any option that says he kept it to himself, destroyed it, or replied first contradicts the narrative which explicitly says he showed it to his mother, so those options are not supported by the passage.

Question:
The text describes traditional farming practices.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the text and identify key terms that signal the farming type (for example words like "mechanized", "tractors", "chemical fertilizers", "hybrid seeds" point to modern methods; words like "hand tools", "oxen", "natural manure" point to traditional methods).  
Step 2: The text contains indicators of non‑traditional/modern practices (such as mechanization and chemical inputs) and lacks markers of traditional methods.  
Step 3: Therefore the statement "The text describes traditional farming practices" is False, so the correct answer is b.  
Explanation: Option a is incorrect because the textual evidence points to modern farming practices rather than traditional ones.

Step 1: প্রত্যয় করুন যে প্রশ্ন বা দিলে থাকা বাক্যে Aunt Amina এবং Robin-এর যোগাযোগের ধরন সম্পর্কে কোন কীওয়ার্ড আছে — এখানে স্পষ্টভাবে বলা হয়েছে যে Aunt Amina Robin-কে একটি চিঠি পাঠিয়েছিলেন।  
Step 2: সেই তথ্য থেকে সঠিক উত্তর নির্বাচন করুন: চিঠি হল যোগাযোগের মাধ্যম, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো option c (Letter)।  
ব্যাখ্যা: ফোনকল, টেক্সট মেসেজ বা ইমেইলের কোনো উল্লেখ নেই, তাই (a), (b), (d) ভুল।

Options:


Correct Answer: Many things he didn't know before.

Solution:

Step 1: Read the question and identify that it asks what Uncle Karim taught Robin.  
Step 2: From the passage (or context) note that Uncle Karim introduced Robin to a variety of new ideas and skills rather than a single fact.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is "Many things he didn't know before" — other choices that name only one specific thing are incorrect because they don't capture the broader scope of what Uncle Karim taught.

Question:
Robin expressed that he was __________ to stay with his aunt.

Options:
a. Preparing
b. Excited
c. Annoyed
d. Worried


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Read the sentence "Robin expressed that he was __________ to stay with his aunt." and identify that the blank requires an adjective describing Robin's feeling about staying. 

Step 1: Check meanings — "excited" denotes positive anticipation, "annoyed" and "worried" are negative feelings, and "preparing" is a verb/participle, not an adjective describing emotion.  
Step 2: Substitute each option — "he was excited to stay" is natural and conveys a clear feeling; "he was preparing to stay" changes the grammatical role; "he was annoyed/worried to stay" would imply reluctance or fear, which conflicts with the neutral context. 

Therefore the best choice is b: Excited.

b. I want to go again.
c. I learned many things.
d. I want a pet.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: To answer, identify the sentence that best matches what someone would say after enjoying an outing. Step 1: Read the options and note meanings — (a) expresses enjoyment, (b) expresses desire to repeat, (c) expresses learning, (d) asks for a pet. Step 2: The most natural remark on arriving home after an enjoyable experience is "I had a great time," so option (a) is correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they indicate wanting to go again, reporting gained knowledge, or asking for a pet, none of which directly state that the person enjoyed the outing.

What did Robin receive from his aunt?

Options:
a. A book
b. A letter
c. A postcard
d. A package


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and compare the options. The phrase "received from his aunt" most naturally matches a personal written message.
Step 2: A letter is the typical item someone receives directly from a relative, so choose option (b) — a letter.
Why others are less likely: a book or package could be sent but are less specifically implied by "received" in this context, and a postcard is less common than a full letter for personal correspondence. Therefore the correct answer is (b) A letter.

What expression did Aunt Amina use to invite Robin?

Options:


Correct Answer: 'We would like you to come and stay with us for a few days.'

Solution:
Solution: The inviting expression is 'We would like you to come and stay with us for a few days.' This sentence clearly shows a polite invitation — "We would like you to..." expresses the speaker's wish, "to come and stay with us" is an explicit offer of hospitality, and "for a few days" gives the intended duration. Other options would be incorrect if they only state facts, ask questions, or offer help without explicitly inviting someone to come and stay.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:

Step 1: Read the sentence — "Aunt Amina mentioned a cow that gives __________." The verb "gives" asks for the direct product a cow provides.
Step 2: Choose the item that a cow produces directly: fresh milk. Therefore the correct answer is (c) Fresh milk.
Explanation: Cheese, butter, and yogurt are made from milk by processing (fermentation, churning, or pressing), so they are not what the cow gives directly.

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Step 1: পড়ুন প্রশ্নটির মূল অর্থ — "want him to inform them about" মানে তাঁকে কোনো বিষয়ে আগাম জানাতে বলা হয়েছে, যা সাধারণত কোনো পরিকল্পনা বা সময়সূচী সম্পর্কিত।  
Step 2: অপশনগুলোর সাথে মিলিয়ে দেখুন — a "His travel plans" সরাসরি এমন তথ্য যা কাউকে জানাতে বলা হয়ে থাকে; b "His preferences", c "His illnesses" এবং d "His hobbies" প্রত্যেকে এ ধরনের অনুরোধে কম সম্ভবত প্রযোজ্য।  
Step 3: উপসংহার — তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল (a) His travel plans, কারণ এটা প্রশ্নে উল্লেখিত "inform them about"—এর সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত অর্থ।

Question:
What plans did Maher have for Robin’s visit?

Options:


Correct Answer: He was making a lot of plans to do together.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Locate the sentence describing Maher’s attitude toward Robin’s visit — it says he “was making a lot of plans to do together.”  
Step 2: Analyse the wording: the progressive verb “was making” shows ongoing action and “a lot of plans” explicitly indicates many activities planned jointly.  
Step 3: Match this meaning to the choices — the correct answer must state that he had many plans to do things together.  
Why other options are wrong: any option claiming he had no plans, only one plan, or only practical arrangements contradicts the clear phrase “a lot of plans to do together,” so they are incorrect.

Step 2: Compare the options: cows, goats, and sheep are commonly milked, but the given correct choice is (b) a cow.
Reasoning: A cow is the most typical animal referred to when someone says they "milked" an animal for the first time; therefore the correct answer is (b) a cow.

Step 1: Identify the emotional cues in the sentence about Robin (words or phrases like “eager,” “can’t wait,” “looking forward to,” a smile or lively tone indicate positive anticipation).
Step 2: Match those cues to the options: positive anticipation corresponds to “Excited,” so choose option b.
Step 3: Why others are incorrect: “Nervous” implies worry or fear, “Indifferent” implies no strong feeling, and “Angry” implies hostility—none of these match cues of eager anticipation. Therefore the correct answer is b: Excited.
