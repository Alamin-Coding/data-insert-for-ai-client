Question:
Which clothing item did Imran decide against due to its design?

Options:
a. A jacket
b. A T-shirt with prints
c. A dress
d. A trouser


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement and identify the reason given — Imran rejected an item because of its design.  
Step 2: Match that reason to the options: only "A T-shirt with prints" describes a notable design feature, so that fits the stated cause.  
Step 3: Conclude that the correct choice is (b) because a printed T‑shirt has a design; the other options (a jacket, a dress, a trouser) are not described as being rejected for their design.

Question:
What does the assistant check for Imran?

Options:
a. New arrivals
b. Different colors
c. Available stocks
d. Discount offers


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and the options carefully to identify what the assistant is checking for Imran.  
Step 2: Compare each option with the likely task described — among the choices, "Available stocks" most directly matches a typical check an assistant would perform to inform Imran whether items are in stock. Therefore the correct answer is option c.  
Explanation of incorrect options: "New arrivals" and "Different colors" refer to product attributes rather than availability, and "Discount offers" refers to pricing promotions; none match the direct task of verifying inventory like "Available stocks" does.

Question:
What kind of shoes does Imran want?

Options:


Correct Answer: Shoes with a bit of heel but not too high.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Imran’s stated preference — he wants some lift but not an excessive height. 
Step 2: Match that preference to the choices; the option describing "shoes with a bit of heel but not too high" fits exactly. 
Explanation: Options like completely flat shoes lack the lift he asked for, and very high heels contradict "not too high," so they are incorrect.

Question:
Imran is __________ about the size and fit of his clothes.

Options:
a. indifferent
b. particular
c. uninterested
d. confused


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence — Imran is ________ about the size and fit of his clothes — which asks for a word describing his attitude toward fit and sizing.
Step 2: Compare meanings: "particular" means careful or picky about details (so he cares how clothes fit); "indifferent" and "uninterested" mean he doesn't care; "confused" means unsure.
Step 3: Since the context implies he cares about size and fit, the best choice is b: particular.

Conclusion: The correct answer is c (Baggy).

Question:
Who pays for the clothing items in the conversation?

Options:


Correct Answer: Mrs. Urmila Karim

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Scan the conversation for any explicit statement about who will pay for the clothing items.

Step 3: Conclude that Mrs. Urmila Karim is the payer.  

Explanation: The named person directly taking responsibility for payment is Mrs. Urmila Karim, so other options are incorrect because they are not mentioned as paying in the dialogue.

Question:
Imran does not like shirts with __________ on them.

Options:
a. patterns
b. buttons
c. cartoons
d. stripes


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence "Imran does not like shirts with __________ on them." and note the blank needs something that can be "on" a shirt (a print or design).

Step 2: Test the options:
- a patterns → "shirts with patterns on them" is possible.
- b buttons → "shirts with buttons on them" is grammatical but buttons are functional rather than a printed design.
- c cartoons → "shirts with cartoons on them" is a common phrase meaning shirts printed with cartoon images.
- d stripes → "shirts with stripes on them" is possible but usually expressed as "striped shirts."

Conclusion: The best and most natural fit is option c (cartoons), because it clearly describes shirts printed with cartoon images that someone might dislike. Other choices are less natural or refer to style/function rather than printed images.

Question:
What does the term 'baggy' refer to in clothing?

Options:
a. Tight fit
b. Loose fit
c. Short length
d. Fancy design


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The term "baggy" describes the fit of clothing that has extra room and hangs loosely on the body.  
Step 2: Therefore "baggy" means a loose or roomy fit, not tight or short.  
Step 3: Correct answer: b (Loose fit).  
Explanation why others are wrong: a (Tight fit) is the opposite of baggy, c (Short length) refers to garment length rather than fit, and d (Fancy design) refers to style/ornamentation, not how closely the clothing fits.

Question:
What does Imran think about the first shirt he tries on?

Options:


Correct Answer: It fits perfectly.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the line in the text where Imran comments on the first shirt — he says it “fits perfectly,” which is a direct statement about fit.  
Step 2: Interpret that phrase: “fits perfectly” means the shirt matches his size and feels right, so it is neither too large nor too small.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices (e.g., too big, too small, or unsuitable) because they contradict his explicit remark. Therefore the correct answer is: it fits perfectly.

Question:
Imran prefers a shirt that is __________ and formal.

Options:
a. bright
b. comfortable
c. plain
d. tight


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the adjective that naturally pairs with "formal" — a formal shirt is usually simple or understated in style.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: "bright" suggests vivid colors (not typically formal), "comfortable" describes fit/feel rather than style, "plain" means simple/solid and matches the idea of formal, and "tight" refers to fit and can be inappropriate for formal wear.  
Conclusion: Option c "plain" is the best choice because it directly complements "formal" in describing a suitably simple, formal shirt.

Question:
What kind of fit does Imran prefer for his jeans?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the description of Imran’s preference — he prefers jeans that are loose, roomy and comfortable rather than snug or tapered.  
Step 2: Match that description to the fit options: "baggy fit" corresponds to loose and roomy, while "slim", "regular" or "tapered" imply a closer or structured fit.  
Step 3: Conclude that the correct choice is "Baggy fit" because it directly matches the described loose, comfortable style; the other options are incorrect as they denote firmer, slimmer silhouettes.

Question:
The trial room is located at the __________ of the shop.

Options:
a. front
b. side
c. middle
d. back


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Explanation: In most shops the trial (fitting) room is placed at the back to give customers privacy and to keep the front and middle areas free for displays and circulation. Placing it at the front would expose customers entering/trying clothes, the side may still be visible from the sales floor, and the middle would block pathways and displays. Therefore the best choice is option d: back.

Step 2: Eliminate the other options: casual wear is informal, school clothes are for students, and beachwear is for seaside use — none match a formal requirement.  
Therefore the correct answer is a: Formal wear.

Question:
The shop assistant checked the __________ for size options.

Options:
a. warehouse
b. shelf
c. stockroom
d. backroom


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the context — a shop assistant looking for different size options for an item, so they would go to the place in the store where extra inventory is kept.  
Step 2: Compare options: a "warehouse" is typically off-site or very large storage, a "shelf" is on the sales floor and holds displayed items, a "stockroom" and a "backroom" are both in-store storage areas.  
Step 3: Choose the most natural, commonly used term in retail for where an assistant checks sizes within the store — "backroom". Therefore the correct answer is d (backroom).  

Brief note on other options: "warehouse" is usually larger and separate from the shop floor; "shelf" is where displayed items sit; "stockroom" is close in meaning but "backroom" is the more idiomatic choice here.

ধাপ ২: প্রদত্ত অপশনগুলোর মধ্যে 'shirt' (b) এই বাক্যে সবচেয়ে স্বাভাবিক ও প্রাকৃতিকভাবে মানায় — "a shirt that is not too big" একটি প্রচলিত প্রকাশ। অন্যগুলো দেখলে 'hat' বা 'jacket'ও সম্ভব হলেও কম স্বাভাবিক, আর 'pair of shoes' হলো জোড়া আইটেম বলে বাক্যের ছাঁচ থেকে খানিকটা আলাদা।  
সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: b (shirt).
