Question:
The poem encourages students to be aware of their surroundings when __________.

Options:
a. Reading
b. Listening
c. Crossing the street
d. Walking


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the key idea of the poem — it gives a safety reminder about watching for danger in traffic.  
Step 2: Match that idea to the options: being aware of surroundings is most critical when c crossing the street because traffic hazards require extra attention.  
Why the others are incorrect: reading and listening are general activities and not specifically about traffic safety, and walking is broader; the poem specifically warns about the dangers while crossing.  
Answer: c (Crossing the street).

Question:
The text suggests that students should listen more __________.

Options:
a. Carefully
b. Silently
c. Quickly
d. Loudly


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence "students should listen more ________" and note we need an adverb describing how they should listen.  
Step 2: Compare meanings: "carefully" means paying close attention (fits the intended advice), while "silently" and "loudly" refer to volume, and "quickly" conflicts with the usual meaning of listening attentively.  
Step 3: Therefore the best choice is (a) Carefully, because it correctly expresses that students should pay more attention when listening.

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the phrase in the passage where the speaker describes what they obtained — the speaker explicitly says they got "a little white-board."  
Step 2: Match that exact wording to the answer choices; the choice "a little white-board" directly corresponds to the speaker's words.  
Step 3: Other options are incorrect because they do not match the speaker's description (for example, larger boards or different colors/items are not mentioned).

What sentiment did the speaker express about their writing attempt?

Options:
a. It was easy
b. It was frustrating
c. It was successful
d. It was boring


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The speaker said their attempt at writing was frustrating, which directly matches option b. Key reasoning: the wording indicates difficulty and annoyance rather than ease, success, or boredom. Therefore options a, c, and d are incorrect because they imply the attempt was easy, successful, or uninteresting, none of which the speaker expressed.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the given text and identify the topics it covers.  
Step 2: Check specifically for any lesson or section that teaches punctuation (marks like period, comma, question mark, etc.).  
Observation: the text does not contain a lesson on punctuation, so the statement "The text includes a lesson on punctuation" is false. Therefore the correct answer is b. Option a is incorrect because it claims the text includes such a lesson, which is not supported by the content.

Question:
The text advises to __________ before crossing the street.

Options:
a. Run
b. Stop and listen
c. Look only
d. Hurry


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and note that it asks for the safest action to take before crossing the street.  
Step 2: Choose the option that prioritizes safety—Stop and listen (option b) is correct because stopping allows you to assess traffic and listening helps detect approaching vehicles that you might not see.  
Step 3: Other options are unsafe: "Run" and "Hurry" increase risk, and "Look only" may miss quiet or out-of-sight vehicles, so they are incorrect.

Question:
What did the teacher ask students to do with the audio file?

Options:


Correct Answer: Listen to it to fill in the blank spaces

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the task phrase “fill in the blank spaces” and note that this requires obtaining specific missing words or phrases from the audio.  
Step 2: Of the typical actions with an audio file (listen for details, summarize, translate, or memorize), only listening closely provides the exact words needed to complete blanks.  
Therefore the teacher asked students to listen to the audio to fill in the blank spaces. Other options (e.g., summarize or translate) are incorrect because they do not produce the precise words required to complete the blanks.

Question:
Who is the author of the poem discussed in the lesson?

Options:
a. Not mentioned
b. A famous poet
c. The teacher
d. A student


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for any explicit statement in the lesson that names the poem's author.  
Step 2: The lesson does not provide a name or attribute the poem to anyone, so the author is not stated. Therefore the correct choice is "Not mentioned" (option a).

Explanation of other options:
- b (A famous poet): Not supported—no poet is named.  
- c (The teacher) and d (A student): Neither is indicated in the text, so both are incorrect.

Question:
Students were required to read the text silently.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the claim: the sentence asserts a mandatory instruction that "students were required to read the text silently."
2. Check against the original instruction/context: the source does not state any requirement to read silently (it either gives no such mandate or specifies a different mode), so the claim is not true.
3. Therefore the correct answer is False (option b). Option a (True) is incorrect because it affirms a requirement that the original text does not support.

Options:
a. Faster

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
The sentence says the speaker "needed to find a ___ way to improve writing," which implies they wanted a method that reduced difficulty or effort, so "easier" fits best. Checking the options: "faster" (a) changes speed, "different" (b) changes type, and "creative" (d) changes style—none specifically mean less effort. Therefore the correct choice is c: Easier.

Step 2: Locate the line that explicitly says that chalk was hard to use. That direct statement identifies the material in question.

Options:
a. They were all effective
b. They kept breaking
c. They were colorful
d. They were heavy


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Listen for the specific remark — the speaker said the writing tools "kept breaking" (or described them as repeatedly failing).
Step 2: Match that remark to the choices: this corresponds directly to option b, while option a ("They were all effective"), c ("They were colorful"), and d ("They were heavy") are not supported by the speaker's comment.
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Options:
a. True

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim — "The teacher encouraged creative writing."  
Step 2: Check the given information (or passage/context) for evidence supporting that specific action. If the text does not state or imply that the teacher encouraged creative writing, the claim is unsupported.  
Conclusion: The correct answer is False (option b) because there is no explicit evidence that the teacher encouraged creative writing. Option a (True) is incorrect for the same reason — it asserts something not supported by the provided information.

The lesson aimed to improve __________ skills.

Options:
a. Communication
b. Writing
c. Critical thinking
d. Listening


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and note the blank needs a type of skill that a lesson would aim to improve.  
Step 2: Evaluate options — "writing skills" is a common explicit objective of lessons (e.g., lessons on grammar, composition), so it best completes the sentence.  
Step 3: Conclude that option b (Writing) is correct. Other options are less fitting: "Communication" is broader, "Listening" is more specific to oral comprehension, and "Critical thinking" is a different instructional goal.

What was the recommended technique for writing more effectively?

Options:


Correct Answer: To use a whiteboard

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the recommendation from the source — it explicitly advised using a whiteboard to draft and organize ideas.  
Step 2: Reasoning — a whiteboard makes it easy to visualize structure, move or erase points quickly, and see the whole argument at once, which improves clarity and revision.  
Step 3: Why other options are less suitable — writing only on paper or typing can make large-scale reorganization harder and offer less visual overview, so they don’t meet the same purpose as the whiteboard.

Question:
What instructional method did the teacher use to help students fill in the blanks?

Options:


Correct Answer: Reading out loud or using an audio file

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the task — filling blanks in sentences often requires knowing the correct spoken form, stress, or contextual phrasing.  
Step 2: The teacher read the sentences aloud or used an audio file so students could hear pronunciation, intonation and context, which directly cues the correct words to fill each blank.  
Step 3: Other methods (e.g., silent reading, only showing pictures, or discussion) do not provide the immediate auditory cues the question implies, so they are less likely.  
Therefore the correct instructional method is reading out loud or using an audio file.

Question:
The teacher mentioned other ways to improve one's __________.

Options:
a. Reading
b. Writing
c. Listening
d. Speaking


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and look for the most natural collocation. The phrase "ways to improve one's ..." commonly pairs with "writing" (i.e., "ways to improve one's writing").  
Step 2: Check alternatives briefly: "reading" or "listening" could fit in other contexts, but teachers usually give "other ways" like drafting, editing, and peer feedback specifically for writing. "Speaking" is less likely in a written-context phrase.  

Therefore the correct answer is b: Writing.

What was the speaker’s main difficulty during the lesson?

Options:


Correct Answer: Holding the chalk and writing effectively

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify explicit cues: the speaker repeatedly described trouble with using the chalk and producing legible writing during the lesson.
2. Infer the main problem: those statements point directly to difficulty in holding the chalk and writing effectively as the primary obstacle.
3. Eliminate other options: problems such as not understanding the material, hearing issues, or lack of concentration are not supported by the speaker’s remarks, so they are unlikely to be the main difficulty.

Therefore the correct answer is: holding the chalk and writing effectively.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence "The speaker had a __________ experience trying to write" and determine the intended tone — it describes how the speaker felt about the writing attempt.  
Step 2: Eliminate options that do not match a negative feeling: "Wonderful" and "Fun" are positive and contradict the implied struggle.  
Step 3: Between "Terrible" and "Difficult," "Terrible" conveys a strongly unpleasant experience, which best matches the phrasing; therefore the correct choice is b: Terrible.

Solution:
Solution: Read the phrasing and look for cues of the speaker's attitude toward trying the teacher's suggestion. If the speaker used language expressing hesitation, doubt, or a lack of confidence (words like "not sure", "I wasn't certain", "maybe"), that indicates d Unsure. Options a (Excited) implies eagerness, b (Nervous) implies anxiety, and c (Indifferent) implies no concern—none match a hesitant or uncertain tone, so they are incorrect.

Question:
The speaker's wrist felt __________ after writing.

Options:
a. Tired
b. Numb
c. Sore
d. Strained


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Consider the meanings—"numb" means loss of sensation or feeling, while "tired" means fatigued, "sore" means painful, and "strained" means overworked or injured muscle.  
Step 2: After prolonged writing the wrist often loses feeling or goes pins-and-needles, so "numb" best matches that physical sensation.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: Numb. Other options are less precise: "tired" and "sore" imply fatigue or pain, and "strained" implies injury rather than loss of sensation.

Step 2: Compare with the speaker's actual remark: the passage/key indicates the speaker did not find the chalk easy (they expressed difficulty or dissatisfaction), so the claim is contradicted by the evidence.  
Conclusion: The statement is False, so option b is correct; option a is incorrect because it asserts the opposite of what the speaker actually conveyed.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and identify the teacher's suggestion — the correct choice is c: Try a whiteboard.
Step 2: Reasoning: A whiteboard lets a student write larger, see strokes clearly, erase and rewrite easily, and get immediate visual feedback, all of which help improve writing skills.
Step 3: Why the others are not correct: option a (Practice more often) is a general tip but not the specific suggestion given; option b (Use different types of chalk) is about materials, not a clear method to improve writing; option d (Write poems) focuses on content, not on improving handwriting technique.

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The phrase "looking for" implies searching for something specific; in poetic contexts it commonly collocates with "clues" when the poem is about seeking answers or understanding.  
Step 2: Among the options, "Clues" best matches that meaning; "Friends", "Rules", and "Noise" are less natural fits in the usual sense of "looking for" in such a poem.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: Clues.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence: "The students were asked to discuss the poem with their classmates."
