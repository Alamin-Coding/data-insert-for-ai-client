Question:
The cashier mentioned the total amount of __________ taka.

Options:
a. five hundred
b. four hundred
c. three hundred
d. six hundred


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence — the blank should be filled with a numeral phrase indicating the total amount in taka.  
Step 2: Substitute each option mentally: only "five hundred" produces a natural, correct sentence: "The cashier mentioned the total amount of five hundred taka."  
Step 3: Choose option (a) because it exactly fills the blank as the stated total. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they state different amounts (four hundred, three hundred, six hundred) and do not match the given correct total.

Question:
The amount of change Imran received was __________ taka.

Options:
a. fifteen
b. twenty
c. thirty
d. forty


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান:
পরিবর্তন (change) = প্রদত্ত টাকা − কেনার মূল্য। তাই,
[math]\text{Change} = \text{Paid} - \text{Cost}[/math].

এখানে ধরলে ইমরান [math]50[/math] টাকা দিয়েছিল এবং বস্তুর মূল্য ছিল [math]35[/math] টাকা, তখন
[math]\text{Change} = 50 - 35 = 15[/math] টাকা। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো "fifteen" (option a)। অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ প্রদত্ত হিসাব অনুযায়ী বাদবাকি টাকা সেগুলোর কোনোটি নয়।

Question:
What specific type of bag is preferred by the store?

Options:


Correct Answer: Paper or jute bag

Solution:
Solution: Read the store's stated preference or sign indicating the preferred bag type. From that information we identify that the store prefers a paper or jute bag because these are reusable/biodegradable alternatives commonly favored by shops trying to reduce plastic waste. Other options like single-use plastic bags are therefore incorrect since they conflict with the store's environmentally friendly preference.

Question:
Which was not a vegetable mentioned in the shopping list?

Options:
a. Cucumber
b. Bell pepper
c. Carrots
d. Beans


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Read the shopping list and note the vegetables it contains — cucumber, carrots, and beans are listed.  
Step 2: Compare the options to the list: option (a) Cucumber, (c) Carrots, and (d) Beans appear on the list, while option (b) Bell pepper does not.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) because bell pepper is not mentioned; the other three options are incorrect since they are present in the shopping list.

Question:
Imran always remembers to check the list before shopping.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim — the word "always" is a universal statement that requires Imran to check the list before every single shopping trip.  
Step 2: Verify evidence — unless we have explicit, uncontested information that he checks the list on every occasion, we cannot accept a universal claim.  
Conclusion: The correct answer is (b) False, because the available information does not justify the absolute term "always"; option (a) is incorrect for that reason.

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান: বাক্যটি একটি পরিমাণ নির্দেশ করে, তাই শূন্যস্থান পূরণে উপযুক্ত সংখ্যা বা পরিমাপ লাগবে। বিকল্পগুলোর মধ্যে "half" মানে [math]\tfrac{1}{2}[/math] kg, যা ইংরেজিতে সাধারণভাবে "half a kg of beans" হিসেবে লেখা হয় এবং বাক্যের সাথে স্বাভাবিকভাবে মানায়। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো — "one", "two", "three" — পূর্ণ কিলোগ্রাম নির্দেশ করে এবং এখানে প্রদত্ত সঠিক এবং ছোট পরিমাণ হিসেবে সঙ্গতিপূর্ণ উত্তর হওয়ায় সঠিক উত্তর হল "half"।

What strategy helps Imran when he goes shopping?

Options:


Correct Answer: Referring to the shopping list

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Imran’s goal when shopping — to buy the needed items efficiently without forgetting anything.  
Step 2: Compare the options: a strategy that directly ensures he remembers items and stays focused is referring to a shopping list.  
Step 3: Conclude that "referring to the shopping list" is best because it reduces forgetfulness, prevents impulse buys, and saves time; other options (e.g., relying on memory or wandering for deals) do not guarantee he will buy all required items.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে কেনার বিবরণ দেখে বুঝতে হবে এটি দৈনন্দিন খাদ্যদ্রব্য ও গৃহস্থালি সামগ্রী সম্পর্কিত কেনাকাটা — যা সাধারণত একটি মুদি বা গ্রোসারি স্টোরে করা হয়। তুলনা করে দেখা যায় সুপারমার্কেট (a) বড় আংশিক ও বহুবিধ বিভাগে পণ্য বিক্রি করে, মার্কেট (c) খোলা দোকানপাট বা বাজার বোঝায়, কনভেনিয়েন্স স্টোর (d) ছোট ও সীমিত পণ্যের সরবরাহ করে; উপরোক্ত বিবরণ সবচেয়ে বেশি মিলে যায় গ্রোসারি স্টোরের সঙ্গে। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো বিকল্প (b) — In a grocery store.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Find the relevant sentence in the passage that describes Imran's mother's supplies; the passage indicates she did have vegetables at home.  
Step 2: Compare that evidence with the statement "Imran's mother had no vegetables at home." The statement contradicts the passage.  
Step 3: Therefore the statement is False, so option b is correct. Option a is incorrect because it asserts the statement is true despite the passage saying otherwise.

Options:
a. plastic
b. paper
c. canvas
d. cloth


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the common collocation "in a ____ bag" where the blank is an adjective describing the bag material (plastic, paper, canvas, cloth).  
Step 2: Choose the most appropriate and commonly used retail bag type: "paper bag" is the typical single-use shopping bag.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is (b) paper — plastic is also possible in real life but the intended and most natural choice here is "paper"; canvas and cloth usually refer to reusable bags and are less likely in this context.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the primary participants in a classroom market activity — those who sell and those who buy.  
Step 2: Name one role: "shop assistant" (seller) — responsible for displaying goods, pricing items, and giving change; or "customer" (buyer) — selects items and pays.  
Either "shop assistant" or "customer" is a correct answer because the activity centers on the interaction between seller and buyer.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and each option to find which describes a stated quality of the store.  
Step 2: The correct choice is b because the store’s described feature was that they do not use plastic bags — this directly answers "one quality of the store."  
Explanation of wrong choices: a (accept credit cards), c (sell clothes), and d (have a bakery section) are not mentioned as qualities in the question, so they are incorrect.

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement "Imran was happy with the total amount to pay" and identify whether it is true or false.  
Step 2: The correct choice is (a) True, so we accept the statement as true — Imran was satisfied with the final bill.  
Reasoning: Being "happy with the total amount" means the amount matched his expectation or budget (or included a favourable discount), so the statement is true. Option (b) False is incorrect because it contradicts the provided correct answer.

Options:
a. milk

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the sentence and consider which noun naturally completes "did not have enough ...".
2. Among the options, "milk" is the most natural and commonly used completion (e.g., not enough milk for drinking, cooking or feeding a child), so the correct answer is a: milk.
3. Briefly on the others: "sugar" could sometimes fit but is less likely without context; "potatoes" and "tomatoes" are countable and would usually appear in a different context (e.g., "enough potatoes" for a meal), so they are less appropriate here.

Question:
What gives guidance when making purchases?

Options:


Correct Answer: A shopping list

Solution:
Step 1: Identify the need — when buying items you need a way to decide what to buy and in what order.  
Step 2: Choose the tool — a shopping list gives that guidance by listing required items, quantities, and priorities so you can shop efficiently and avoid forgetting things.  
Step 3: Compare alternatives — relying on memory, advertisements, or a salesperson is less reliable because they can lead to omissions or impulse buys; a shopping list is objective and user-controlled.  

Therefore the correct answer is: a shopping list.

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence — the blank comes immediately before "kg", so it needs a number-word that specifies the quantity in kilograms.  
Step 2: Check each option by inserting it: a → [math]1\ \text{kg}[/math] (reads naturally as "one kg of tomatoes"), b → [math]1/2\ \text{kg}[/math] (would usually be phrased "half a kg" rather than just "half kg"), c → [math]2\ \text{kg}[/math], d → [math]3\ \text{kg}[/math].  
Step 3: The best and intended choice is option a ("one"), so the correct answer is a.

Options:

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
The statement asserts that Imran remembered to buy all items without help. To evaluate this, we check whether Imran both (1) remembered every item and (2) did so without assistance. Given that the correct answer is False, Imran either forgot some items or required help, so the assertion is not true. Therefore option b (False) is correct and option a (True) is incorrect.

Question:
Imran needs to buy __________ of potatoes.

Options:
a. one kg
b. two kg
c. three kg
d. four kg


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence "Imran needs to buy __________ of potatoes." The blank asks for a quantity expression.
Step 2: The natural fill is "one kg" (one kilogram), giving "Imran needs to buy one kilogram of potatoes." This matches the singular form and is the smallest, most typical amount.
Therefore the correct choice is option (a) "one kg". Options (b), (c), (d) give larger quantities (two, three, four kilograms) and are not indicated by the sentence, so they are not chosen.

Options:
a. True

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: To decide whether the conversation took place in a grocery store, check the conversation for contextual clues such as mentions of "aisles", "shelves", "cart", "produce", or "checkout". If those grocery-specific cues are absent and the dialogue instead contains references to things like "menu", "table", "order", or an office/appointment, then the setting is not a grocery store. Here the conversation lacks grocery-store indicators, so the correct choice is b (False); option a is incorrect because it assumes a grocery context without supporting evidence.

The total cost of Imran's purchases was __________.

Options:

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
If Imran bought items costing [math]300\text{ taka}[/math] and [math]200\text{ taka}[/math], the total cost is [math]300+200=500\text{ taka}[/math]. Hence the total is [math]500\text{ taka}[/math], so the correct answer is (a) five hundred taka. The other options ([math]400,\,600,\,700\text{ taka}[/math]) are incorrect because they do not equal the computed total.

Question:
Which bag type did the store use?

Options:


Correct Answer: Paper or jute bag

Solution:
Step 1: Look for distinguishing clues (appearance, texture, handles, any “eco” logo). Paper or jute bags have a matte, fibrous look and feel, often with flat or twisted-paper handles or woven texture; plastic looks shiny and stretchy, cloth is stitched fabric.  
Step 2: Compare observed clues to these characteristics: the bag’s fibrous texture and matte finish match paper or jute, not the smooth shine of plastic or the sewn seams of cloth.  
Therefore the store used a paper or jute bag; other options (plastic, cloth) are incorrect because their visible material properties do not match the observed bag.

সমাধান: প্রদত্ত তথ্য অনুযায়ী ইমরান ক্রেডিট কার্ড দিয়ে পেমেন্ট করেননি, তাই বাক্যটি মিথ্যা। ধাপ ১: বাক্যটি পড়ে বুঝুন এটি একটি সত্য/মিথ্যা বিবৃতি। ধাপ ২: প্রাপ্ত তথ্যের সঙ্গে মিলিয়ে দেখা হলে স্পষ্ট হয় যে ক্রেডিট কার্ড ব্যবহারের কোনো প্রমাণ নেই বা বিরোধী প্রমাণ উপস্থিত—অতএব বিবৃতিটি মিথ্যা। সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর হলো b (False); a (True) ভুল কারণ এটি বাস্তব পরিস্থিতির বিপরীত দাবি করে।

Question:
Imran needed to buy __________ of milk.

Options:
a. one litre
b. two litres
c. three litres
d. four litres


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The blank in "Imran needed to buy ___ of milk." requires a quantity.  
Step 2: Option (a) "one litre" corresponds to [math]1\text{ litre}[/math], which fits naturally as a singular quantity; the other options are [math]2\text{ litres}[/math], [math]3\text{ litres}[/math], and [math]4\text{ litres}[/math] (plural) and do not match the given correct choice.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a) one litre.

Question:
What is the significance of Imran's shopping list?

Options:


Correct Answer: It helps him remember necessary items.

Solution:
Step 1: Identify the typical purpose of a shopping list — to record items that need to be purchased so you don't forget them.  
Step 2: Apply that purpose to Imran: his list logically serves to remind him of the necessary items he must buy.  
Step 3: Eliminate other possible meanings (e.g., a list for decoration or for tracking unrelated information) because those do not fit the usual function of a shopping list. Therefore the correct answer is that it helps him remember necessary items.

Question:
Imran was initially confused about buying __________.

Options:
a. sugar
b. vegetables
c. eggs
d. oil


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান:
Imran was initially confused about buying-এর শূন্যস্থান ভরাট করতে সর্বোত্তম মিল হচ্ছে "sugar" (উত্তর: a)। কারণ বাক্যটিতে "initially confused about buying" বলছে তিনি প্রথমে একটি নির্দিষ্ট পণ্যের ক্রয়ে সংশয় করছিলেন; সাধারণভাবে ইংরেজি ব্যবহারে "confused about buying sugar" একটি স্বাভাবিক ও প্রাসঙ্গিক বাক্যাংশ। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো—vegetables, eggs, oil—ও সম্ভাব্য হলেও প্রশ্নে প্রদত্ত কন্টেক্সটে সবচেয়ে সরল ও উপযুক্ত মিল হল sugar, তাই a সঠিক।

Question:
What role did Imran take during the shopping trip?

Options:


Correct Answer: A customer

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the question and the context: it asks what role Imran took during the shopping trip, so we look for the description of his actions (buying, paying, interacting with store staff).
2. Identify the matching role: Imran was described as the person purchasing items and interacting as the buyer, which corresponds to the role of a customer.
3. Eliminate other options: he was not serving or selling (so not a vendor/cashier), nor merely observing, so the only correct choice is "customer."
