Question:
Which animal is characterized by stripes?

Options:
a. Lion.
b. Zebra.
c. Elephant.
d. Horse.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the characteristic in the question — "stripes" are a distinct, repeated linear pattern on an animal's coat.  
Step 2: Match that characteristic to the animals listed: zebras are well known for their black-and-white striped coats, so the correct match is option b (Zebra).  
Step 3: Why the others are incorrect — lions have a tawny coat (and males a mane), elephants have grey, wrinkled skin, and horses usually have solid or spotted coats but not the characteristic striped pattern of a zebra.

Question:
What unique feature is associated with elephants?

Options:
a. Mane.
b. Trunk.
c. Horns.
d. Scales.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the distinctive external features of an elephant — a long muscular nose called a trunk used for breathing, grasping, and drinking.  
Step 2: Compare each option: a) Mane — characteristic of lions, not elephants. c) Horns — found on animals like rhinos or deer, not typical of elephants (they have tusks, which are elongated teeth). d) Scales — found on reptiles and fish, not on elephants.  
Step 3: Conclude that the unique feature associated with elephants is the trunk, so the correct answer is b.

Question:
Which feature is specific to horses?

Options:
a. Horns.
b. Mane.
c. Tail.
d. Stripes.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: List which animals typically have each feature. Horns appear on cattle, goats and similar species; manes appear on horses and some other animals (e.g., lions); tails are present on horses; stripes are characteristic of zebras.  
Step 2: Eliminate options that are not specific to horses. Horns (a) are absent in horses, mane (b) is found on other animals too, and stripes (d) belong to zebras.  
Step 3: Choose the most appropriate feature for horses. The tail (c) is a prominent and characteristic feature of horses, so the correct answer is c.

Question:
What does a moustache specifically refer to?

Options:
a. A line of fur.
b. Hair on the upper lip.
c. Hair on the chin.
d. Hair on the neck.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
A moustache specifically means the hair that grows on the upper lip. Step 1: identify the anatomical location described by each option; Step 2: match it to the definition — option b describes hair on the upper lip, so it fits exactly. The other choices are incorrect because (a) is a vague phrase ("line of fur"), (c) refers to chin hair (beard/goatee), and (d) refers to neck hair, none of which are a moustache. Hence the correct answer is b.

Question:
What can be inferred about the lion's original concern?

Options:
a. It was about his strength.
b. It was purely superficial.
c. It involved other animals.
d. It was about his roar.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the lion’s expressed concern — the context indicates he was worried about his outward look (e.g., mane or appearance), not any deeper trait.  
Step 2: Conclude that this worry is about surface appearance, so it is purely superficial. Therefore option b is correct.

Explanation why others are wrong: option a (his strength) and option d (his roar) refer to abilities, which the text does not suggest he feared; option c (involved other animals) implies social or external conflict, also not indicated.

Question:
Why is the lion referred to as the king of the jungle?

Options:
a. Due to his mane.
b. Because of his roar.
c. For his strength and leadership.
d. Because animals respect him.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the phrase "king of the jungle" as a symbolic title that refers to the lion's dominance, strength and leadership role in its environment.  
Step 2: Evaluate the options: option (a) — the mane is a distinctive feature but is only a physical trait, not the reason for being called "king"; option (b) — the roar is impressive but alone doesn't make it a "king"; option (d) — "animals respect him" is anthropomorphic and describes a perceived consequence, not an explanation. Option (c) — "for his strength and leadership" directly explains the lion's dominant, apex role and social leadership (pride structure), so it best matches the expression.  
Answer: option (c).

Question:
What type of character is the vulture in the story?

Options:
a. Supportive.
b. Sarcastic.
c. Helpful.
d. Indifferent.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Determine the vulture’s tone and behavior in the story by noting its speech and actions — whether it mocks, helps, supports, or ignores the other characters.  
Step 2: The vulture uses ironic or mocking remarks and a biting tone rather than offering real help or simply ignoring the situation, which indicates sarcasm.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options: it is not supportive (would show encouragement), not helpful (would take constructive action), and not merely indifferent (which would show no reaction). Therefore the correct answer is (b) Sarcastic.

Options:
a. His legs.
b. His eyes.
c. His mane.
d. His ears.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the distinctive feature being emphasized — for a male lion the mane is the most notable part that one would be concerned about.
Step 2: Therefore the correct choice is (c) His mane, since that is the specific body part singled out.
Explanation: Options (a) legs, (b) eyes, and (d) ears are general body parts and are not described as the particular concern, so they are incorrect.

Question:
What aspect of vanity did the lion learn to overcome?

Options:
a. Caring about fashion.
b. Worrying about his looks.
c. Seeking validation.
d. Focusing on his crown.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: The question asks which aspect of vanity the lion learned to overcome. 

Step 1: Interpret the options — vain behavior typically refers to excessive concern about one’s appearance.  
Step 2: Match meanings: option (b) "worrying about his looks" directly describes vanity about appearance, while (a) "caring about fashion" is narrower, (c) "seeking validation" is broader social approval, and (d) "focusing on his crown" is metaphorical or specific.  

Therefore the correct answer is (b) because it directly names the lion’s concern about his appearance that he overcame; the other choices are either too specific or describe different kinds of behavior.

Question:
How did the rest of the animals contribute to the theme of the story?

Options:
a. By being shallow.
b. By offering wise advice.
c. By supporting vanity.
d. By ignoring the lion.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the story’s theme — pride/vanity of the lion (the moral centers on how vanity is created and reinforced).  
Step 2: Note the rest of the animals’ behavior — they flatter, praise, and enable the lion’s self‑importance instead of correcting him. That collective encouragement amplifies the theme by showing how society can support and sustain vanity.  
Step 3: Therefore option c is correct: they contributed by supporting vanity.

Why the others are wrong: a is incorrect because the animals are not merely shallow; they actively flatter. b is wrong because they do not offer wise advice or correction. d is wrong because they do not ignore the lion — they engage with him in ways that boost his vanity.

What sound does the lion's roar resemble?

Options:
a. Hissing.
b. A deep growl.
c. A long 's'.
d. A loud bark.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the characteristic of a lion’s roar — it is low-pitched, resonant and guttural.  
Step 2: Compare with the options: "A deep growl" matches the low, powerful sound of a roar, while "hissing" or a "long 's'" describe high, sibilant sounds and "a loud bark" describes a shorter, sharper canine sound.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: A deep growl.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the part of the story where the lion decides to stop worrying about his looks and instead concentrate on his responsibilities as ruler. That statement directly indicates his intention.

Step 2: Eliminate other options: focusing on popularity, friends, or appearance contradicts that explicit decision. Therefore the correct choice is option (a) His duties as king.

Options:
a. It was foolish.
b. It was wise.
c. It was irrelevant.
d. It made him angry.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what the lion thought about the snake's statement — the correct answer given is (b) "It was wise."  
Step 2: Reasoning — the lion judged the content of the snake's remark and found it to show insight or good sense, so he considered it wise.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options — (a) "foolish" contradicts the given answer, (c) "irrelevant" implies the lion ignored it rather than valuing it, and (d) "made him angry" describes an emotional reaction not aligned with deeming the remark wise.  
Therefore the correct choice is (b) it was wise.

Question:
What phase follows the lion's realization of his vanity?

Options:
a. He seeks more advice.
b. He dismisses his friends.
c. He embraces his identity as a king.
d. He changes his diet.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution: After the lion recognizes his vanity, the natural narrative consequence is that he accepts his true nature and responsibilities, so he "embraces his identity as a king" (option c). This follows because realization of vanity typically leads to self-awareness and a return to authentic role and dignity rather than seeking more external approval or changing unrelated habits. Options a and b are less likely: seeking more advice prolongs dependence instead of self-acceptance, and dismissing friends contradicts the humility implied by realization; option d (changing his diet) is irrelevant to an inner moral or identity change. Hence the correct choice is c.

Question:
What can be inferred about the lion's relationships with other animals?

Options:
a. They are all jealous.
b. They respect him.
c. They do not care for him.
d. They make him vain.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the behavioral evidence — the other animals defer to the lion, follow his lead, or show deference rather than hostility or indifference.  
Step 2: From that behavior we infer a relationship of respect; they treat him as a leader or authority figure.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) They respect him.

Why other options are incorrect: (a) “They are all jealous” would show hostility or rivalry, which contradicts their deference; (c) “They do not care for him” implies indifference, but their actions show engagement and deference; (d) “They make him vain” requires active flattery causing arrogance, for which there is no supporting evidence.

Question:
Which phrase best describes the lion's character development?

Options:
a. Became more vain.
b. Learned wisdom.
c. Grew weaker.
d. Lost friends.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Compare the lion's behavior at the beginning and end of the story — initially proud/arrogant, later showing reflection and better judgment.  
Step 2: The change from arrogance to thoughtful decisions indicates acquisition of insight and wise choices, which matches "learned wisdom."  
Step 3: Other options fail: "Became more vain" contradicts the shown humility, "Grew weaker" is not supported by the narrative, and "Lost friends" is not the central change described.  
Therefore the best description is option b: Learned wisdom.

Options:
a. It is filled with conflict.
b. It shows support for each other.
c. It is superficial.
d. It's about authority.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Observe the lion’s behavior toward the other animals: it engages briefly, maintains distance, and doesn’t form deep or reciprocal bonds. Step 2 — From those observations we infer that the relationships are surface-level and transactional rather than supportive or contentious, so option (c) is correct. Brief note on other choices: (a) conflict would show open hostility, (b) support would show mutual help, and (d) authority would show clear dominance and enforcement—none of which the interactions consistently display.

Options:
a. Strength in numbers.
b. The pursuit of beauty.
c. The importance of inner wisdom.
d. Animal friendships.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central actions and outcomes — the protagonist repeatedly uses insight, sound judgment, or clever decisions to resolve conflicts rather than relying on force, beauty, or friendships.  
Step 2: Match those elements to themes — using wisdom to overcome problems points directly to "the importance of inner wisdom."  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: "Strength in numbers" and "animal friendships" may appear incidentally but are not the driving force of the plot; "the pursuit of beauty" is irrelevant to the main conflicts.  
Therefore the correct answer is c: The importance of inner wisdom.

Question:
How did the lion see his reflection?

Options:
a. In a lake.
b. In the river.
c. In a pond.
d. In a mirror.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: A reflection is formed when light rays bounce off a smooth surface and return to the observer’s eyes.  
Step 2: In the story/context the lion looked at the surface of the river while drinking or standing by it, so the river’s water acted like a reflective surface and he saw his image.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is option b (In a river).  

Explanation of other options: a (lake) and c (pond) are also bodies of water that can reflect, but the given context specifies the river; d (mirror) is unlikely because a lion would not typically encounter a manufactured mirror in that scenario.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: Read the line where the giraffe comments on the lion's mane and note the exact suggestion — the giraffe told the lion to put color to match his moustache, which directly corresponds to option b. Elimination: option a (add a paper crown) and option c (cut it short) are not mentioned in the text, and option d (let it grow long) contradicts the giraffe’s specific advice about coloring rather than changing length. Therefore the correct answer is option b.

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
The correct answer is c. The snake.  
Step 1: Identify who spoke—within the story the snake tells the lion that his hairstyle (appearance) doesn't matter.  
Step 2: Reasoning—the snake emphasizes inner strength and character over outward looks, so it reassures the lion that grooming or hairstyle doesn't change his true power.  
Step 3: Why others are incorrect—none of the other animals (a. zebra, b. vulture, d. hyena) give that particular reassurance in the story, so they are not the source of the advice.

Step 2: Compare this to the options and choose the one that matches: option b states "To be wise and not worry about looks," which directly reflects that lesson.  
Step 3: Briefly reject the others: option a promotes vanity (opposite of the lesson), option c is trivial and unrelated, and option d claims others envy him, which is not the story's main point. Therefore the correct answer is b.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: Recognize the typical sound a lion makes — lions are known for a powerful, low-frequency roar used to communicate over long distances. Step 1: Match the description to the options; a "loud, deep sound" fits a lion's roar. Step 2: Therefore the correct choice is b. Other options are incorrect because a gentle purr describes small cats, a hiss is a defensive sound (e.g., snakes or upset cats), and a high-pitched scream does not match a lion's deep roar.

Correct Answer: c

Solution:

Step 1: Read the passage context asking for the lion’s first thought about his mane — that is the lion’s initial impression.  
Step 2: Compare the choices: (a) “too boring” and (d) “perfect” contradict the description of the mane being wild; (b) “represented his royalty” could be a later or symbolic view but not an initial self-judgment.  
Step 3: The text describes the mane as messy and difficult to manage, so the lion initially believed it was too unruly — therefore the correct answer is (c).

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the story detail — it was the giraffe who suggested that the lion’s mane would look better with color.  
Step 2: Reasoning — the giraffe, noted for noticing appearances (long neck, spotting patterns), made the remark about enhancing the mane; the zebra, vulture, and dog did not make that suggestion in the story.

b. Wisdom.
c. Fear.
d. Pride.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify how the snake is described in the story — its actions, words, or the effect it has on other characters. The snake consistently offers guidance, insight, or represents learning rather than showing self-obsession or causing terror.  
Step 2: Match that description to the choices: guidance and insight correspond to "Wisdom," so option (b) is correct.  
Explanation of wrong choices: (a) Vanity, (c) Fear, and (d) Pride do not fit because the snake is not portrayed as self-centered, frightening, or boastful in the text; its role is clearly instructive and symbolic of wisdom.

Question:
What did the lion think about his appearance?

Options:
a. He thought he needed a new hairstyle.
b. He felt his mane was perfect.
c. He wanted to change his color.
d. He didn't care about his looks.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the statement about the lion's thought — he was thinking about his appearance and wanted a change in how he looked.  
Step 2: Match that meaning to the choices: option (a) "He thought he needed a new hairstyle" directly expresses wanting to change his appearance, so it fits.  
Why others are wrong: (b) says his mane was perfect, which contradicts wanting a change; (c) changing color is not mentioned; (d) saying he didn't care contradicts that he worried about his looks.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a).

Question:
What was the lion's position in the animal kingdom?

Options:
a. The jester.
b. The king.
c. The servant.
d. The protector.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify common cultural and biological attributes of the lion — large size, majestic mane (in males), dominant position in food chain, and frequent historical symbolism as a ruler.  
Step 2: Match those attributes to the options: "the king" best fits because lions are traditionally called "king of beasts" and occupy an apex, dominant role in their ecosystems.  
Step 3: Conclude that option b is correct.  

Briefly why others are incorrect: "the jester" and "the servant" contradict the lion’s dominance and dignity, and while a lion can defend its pride, "the protector" (d) is not the primary symbolic title — the dominant, regal role is expressed by "the king."

Question:
What did the lion do to his mane after realizing he was vain?

Options:
a. He let it grow wild.
b. He shook his head and styled it.
c. He trimmed it all off.
d. He colored it bright.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the key word — "vain" means overly concerned with appearance, so the lion’s reaction would relate to grooming or fixing his looks.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: (a) letting his mane grow wild contradicts caring about appearance; (c) trimming it all off would remove the feature he was vain about; (d) coloring it bright is unlikely and extreme.  
Step 3: Option (b) "He shook his head and styled it" fits best because it shows the lion noticing his vanity and then arranging his mane to look presentable. Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Why did the lion consult other animals?

Options:

b. To seek advice about his hairstyle.
c. To know who ruled the jungle.
d. To learn how to roar better.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে প্রশ্নে দেয়া বিকল্পগুলো বিশ্লেষণ করা যাক। সিংহ যদি অন্য প্রাণীদের পরামর্শ চাইলে সেটা সাধারণত শত্রু ধরার কৌশল বা রাজত্ব নির্ধারণের মত গুরুতর কারণে হওয়া উচিত—কিন্তু এখানে সঠিক উত্তর ব যেটা সিংহ তার চুলছাঁট বা চুলের চেহারা নিয়ে পরামর্শ চাইতে অন্যদের কাছে গিয়েছিল। তাই বিকল্প a (শিকার ধরার উপায়), c (জঙ্গল কে শাসক) এবং d (গর্জন উন্নত করা) অপ্রাসঙ্গিক; এগুলো গল্পের প্রেক্ষাপটে কম যুক্তিযুক্ত। ফলে সঠিক উত্তর ব — তিনি তাঁর হেয়ারস্টাইল সম্পর্কে পরামর্শ নিতে গিয়েছিলেন।

Question:
How did the animals react to the lion's concern about his mane?

Options:
a. They ignored him.
b. They offered him suggestions.
c. They laughed at him.
d. They were jealous.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the story detail — the lion expressed concern about his mane, so observe how the other animals responded to that concern.  
Step 2: Match the observed reaction to the choices: if animals responded by giving advice or help, that corresponds to option (b).  
Step 3: Conclude and justify — the correct choice is (b) because they offered him suggestions. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect: (a) "They ignored him" contradicts the fact that they reacted; (c) "They laughed at him" implies mockery rather than helpfulness; (d) "They were jealous" implies envy, not the supportive behavior described.

Question:
What did the lion vow to do at the end of the story?

Options:
a. Change his hairstyle weekly.
b. Be a wise king.
c. Prepare a royal parade.
d. Seek more advice.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the lion’s final action in the story — he reflects on what he learned and makes a vow about his future behavior.  
Step 2: From the context (the lion learning a lesson about leadership and responsibility), the logical vow is to rule better, so he vows to be a wise king — option b.  
Step 3: The other options are inconsistent with the story’s moral: changing hairstyle (a) and preparing a parade (c) are trivial and unrelated, and seeking more advice (d) contradicts the lion’s expressed decision to apply what he has already learned.

Which animal didn't suggest any changes to the lion's hairstyle?

Options:
a. The zebra.
b. The snake.
c. The vulture.
d. The hyena.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:

Step 1: Read each animal's remark and mark whether it proposed a change to the lion's hairstyle.  
Step 2: Zebra, vulture, and hyena all made suggestions about changing the hairstyle, but the snake did not propose any change.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) the snake; the other options are incorrect because those animals did suggest changes.

Question:
What characteristic did the snake display when speaking to the lion?

Options:
a. Confidence.
b. Fear.
c. Confidence.
d. Anger.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
The snake’s words and tone were calm and assertive, showing assurance rather than trembling or hostility—so it displayed confidence. This rules out b (fear) because there is no sign of nervousness, and d (anger) because its speech was not hostile. Note that option a duplicates the meaning of option c, and the correct choice given is c (Confidence).

Question:
How did the other animals contribute to the lion's dilemma?

Options:
a. They were unhelpful.
b. They each suggested silly ideas.
c. They supported his vanity.
d. They encouraged him to stay as he was.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and recall the story context — the animals reacted to the lion’s dilemma by offering responses.
Step 2: Remember that the animals kept proposing absurd, impractical suggestions and jokes rather than a serious solution, which increased the lion’s confusion.
Step 3: Therefore the best choice is option b: They each suggested silly ideas.

Briefly why the others are wrong:
- a is wrong because the animals were not merely silent or unhelpful; they actively offered ideas.
- c is wrong because they did not primarily flatter the lion’s vanity.
- d is wrong because they did not encourage him to remain unchanged, but instead gave foolish proposals.
