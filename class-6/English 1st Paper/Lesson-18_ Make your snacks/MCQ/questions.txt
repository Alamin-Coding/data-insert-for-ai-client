During the concert, George Harrison performed in front of an audience of about __________ people.

Options:

What did the concert aim to raise awareness about?

Options:


Correct Answer: The suffering of Bangladesh during the Liberation War.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question focus — the concert's stated purpose was to "raise awareness about" a historical issue.  
Step 2: Match this purpose with the context: a concert aimed to inform people about past suffering and historical events of Bangladesh. Other possible choices (e.g., fundraising, entertainment, or promoting a new album) do not match the phrase "raise awareness about" a historical injustice.  
Step 3: Conclude that the concert aimed to raise awareness about the suffering of Bangladesh during the Liberation War.

Question:
The lyrics of the song express joy and celebration.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the lyrics and identify key words and images (e.g., sadness, longing, quietness) that set the tone rather than festive words like “celebrate,” “joy,” or “dance.”  
2. Check the narrator’s emotions and actions: if the speaker describes loss, regret, or subdued reflection, the tone is not celebratory.  
3. Since the lyrics’ dominant mood is not joyful or celebratory, the statement “The lyrics of the song express joy and celebration” is false. Therefore the correct answer is b.  

Why option a is incorrect: option a asserts the lyrics express joy, but the textual evidence shows a different mood, so that assertion does not hold.

Question:
The song appeals to people to help __________ the lives of those affected.

Options:
a. take
b. end
c. save
d. ignore


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence context — "appeals to people to help ___ the lives of those affected" implies a positive, supportive action toward people who have been harmed.  
Step 2: Determine which verb fits both grammatically and semantically. Grammatically, "help" can be followed by a base verb, so all options are possible forms, but semantics decide the choice.  
Step 3: Choose the best meaning: "save the lives" means to rescue or protect those affected, which matches the appeal's intent, so the correct answer is c.  
Why others are wrong: a "take the lives" and b "end the lives" mean causing death (opposite of helping), and d "ignore the lives" makes no sense in the context of an appeal to help.

ধাপ ১: গানটির কথা মনোযোগ দিয়ে পড়া বা শ্রবণ করুন এবং যেখানে বারবার দুঃখ, ত্রাস, নিপীড়ন বা সাহায্যের আবেদন এসেছে তা লক্ষ্য করুন।  
ধাপ ২: গানটির যে সরাসরি বাক্যগুলোতে বা চিত্রকল্পে জনগণেকেই কষ্টে, যুদ্ধ বা ঝুঁকিতে পড়া, সাহায্য চাওয়া দেখানো হয়েছে—এসব থেকে প্রধান থিমগুলি চিহ্নিত করা যায়।  
ধাপ ৩: তাই উপসংহার হলো গানটি মূলত সংগ্রাম, কষ্ট/বেদনা এবং সাহায্যের আবেদন (আশ্রয়ের, আন্তর্জাতিক বা মানবিক সহায়তার অনুরোধ) প্রতিফলিত করে। অন্য সম্ভাব্য থিম যেমন আনন্দ, প্রেম বা উৎসব—এগুলো গানটির স্বর ও বক্তব্যে প্রাধান্য পায় না, তাই সেগুলো ভুল বিকল্প।

Question:
The song 'Bangladesh' describes a __________ situation.

Options:
a. joyful
b. peaceful
c. disastrous
d. happy


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Examine the song's tone and imagery — the lyrics describe suffering, destruction, loss, and urgent distress, which signal a negative, catastrophic context.  
Step 2: From that evidence the correct characterization is "disastrous" because the song highlights calamity and hardship rather than celebration or calm.  
Step 3: Therefore option (c) is correct; options (a) joyful, (b) peaceful, and (d) happy are incorrect because they imply positive, calm emotions that contradict the song's depiction of disaster.

Question:
How did George Harrison contribute to the awareness of Bangladesh's situation?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: George Harrison became aware of the 1971 humanitarian crisis in East Pakistan (later Bangladesh) through reports and his friend Ravi Shankar.  
Step 2: He used his fame and contacts to organise and headline the benefit event called the Concert for Bangladesh (with other major artists) to raise money and attention.  
Step 3: The concert and its recordings generated large-scale media coverage and funds for refugees, directly increasing international awareness and relief.  
Other options (e.g., simply donating money or writing articles) are incorrect because the defining action was organising the high-profile benefit concert that both raised funds and publicity.

Question:
What sentiment does the song 'Bangladesh' convey?

Options:
a. Happiness
b. Desperation
c. Indifference
d. Celebration


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Analyze tone and lyrics: the song "Bangladesh" contains urgent, pleading language and imagery of suffering and need, which are emotional cues of distress rather than joy or neutrality.  
Step 2 — Match cues to options: words and musical features expressing worry, pain, and calls for help align with "desperation."  
Step 3 — Conclude: therefore the best choice is (b) Desperation.

Why others are incorrect: (a) Happiness and (d) Celebration imply upbeat, joyful content which the song lacks; (c) Indifference implies emotional detachment, but the song is emotionally engaged and pleading, not indifferent.

Question:
The text includes mention of a famous sport event.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Define the criterion — a "famous sport event" means an explicit mention of well-known events such as the Olympics, FIFA World Cup, Super Bowl, Wimbledon, etc.  
Step 2: Inspect the text for any of these names or similarly prominent event titles or clear references to a specific major sporting event.  
Step 3: No such explicit mention or reference is found in the text, so the statement "The text includes mention of a famous sport event" is false.  

Therefore the correct answer is (b) False. Option (a) True is incorrect because there is no direct reference to any recognized major sporting event in the given text.

The lyrics ask people to lend a __________ to support Bangladesh.

Options:
a. complaint
b. hand
c. coin
d. word


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the line context — it asks people to give support to Bangladesh, so the blank should be filled by a word meaning “help” or “support.”
Step 2: The idiom “lend a hand” means to help or support someone, so option b (hand) fits perfectly.
Step 3: The other options are unlikely: “complaint” (a) and “word” (d) don’t mean support, and “coin” (c) specifically means money, which is less general than the usual phrase in lyrics.
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Step 2: Those cues indicate strong positive excitement, which corresponds to being "thrilled."  
Step 3: Eliminate the other options: "Upset," "Confused," and "Angry" describe negative or puzzled reactions that contradict the joyful cues.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the lyric fragment "a friend who came with __________ in his eyes" and note that the blank describes an emotional expression visible in the eyes.  
Step 2: "Sadness in his eyes" is the natural reading because eyes are often described as showing sorrow or tears; this fits the usual poetic phrasing.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is c) sadness. Options a) happiness, b) fear, and d) anger would be expressed differently in typical lyrics (e.g., "a smile" for happiness, explicit "fear" or "anger" phrasing), so they are less fitting.

Step 2: প্রাসঙ্গিক সূত্র চেক করুন — টেক্সটে Beatles-এর গিটারিস্ট বা "Here Comes the Sun" / "Something" মতো গানগুলোর উল্লেখ আছে, যা George Harrison-কে নির্দেশ করে।  
Step 3: বিকল্পগুলিকে বাদ দিন — Bob Dylan একজন ফোক/রক সঙ্গীতশিল্পী কিন্তু Beatles-সম্পর্কিত নন; Elton John পিয়ানোবাদক ও সলো আর্টিস্ট; Freddie Mercury Queen-এর সিংগার, তাই টেক্সটে বর্ণিত পরিচয়ের সাথে মেলে না।  

সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: বিকল্প b — George Harrison।

Which famous location hosted the Concert for Bangladesh?

Options:
a. Wembley Stadium
b. Madison Square Garden

Question:
The concert was organized to support the people affected by the World War II.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the source sentence that gives the reason for the concert. Identify the exact event named (for example, the passage states it was for those affected by World War I or another cause).
2. Compare the identified event with the claim "World War II." They do not match.
3. Since the stated reason in the passage is not World War II, the claim is false.

Therefore the correct answer is b (False). Option a is incorrect because it asserts World War II as the cause, which contradicts the passage.

Question:
Who was George Harrison and what did he do for Bangladesh?

Options:


Correct Answer: He was a famous musician who organized the Concert for Bangladesh to help raise awareness and funds.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify George Harrison — he was a famous British musician, best known as lead guitarist of The Beatles.  
Step 2: Identify his action for Bangladesh — in 1971 he organized (with Ravi Shankar) the Concert for Bangladesh, a large benefit concert at Madison Square Garden to raise awareness and funds for Bangladeshi refugees and victims of the war.  
Step 3: Reasoning and conclusion — because he used his fame and music to organize this high-profile relief effort (and not, for example, to serve as a politician or scientist), the correct answer is that he was a famous musician who organized the Concert for Bangladesh to help raise awareness and funds.

The Concert for Bangladesh raised funds for which organization?

Options:
a. Red Cross
b. UNICEF
c. World Food Programme
d. Amnesty International


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the benefit recipient — The Concert for Bangladesh (organized by George Harrison and Ravi Shankar in 1971) was explicitly held to raise funds and awareness for refugees and victims of the Bangladesh Liberation War.
Step 2: Match with organizations — The concert’s proceeds were given to UNICEF to support relief efforts.
Therefore the correct answer is b: UNICEF. The other options are incorrect because the official beneficiary was UNICEF, not the Red Cross, World Food Programme, or Amnesty International.

Question:
The text features a conversation between a daughter and her father.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the text and identify speakers — the lines show an exchange where one speaker is referred to as the daughter and the other as the father.  
Step 2: Because the content consists of direct dialogue between those two characters, the statement "The text features a conversation between a daughter and her father" is true.  
Therefore the correct answer is a; option b is incorrect because it contradicts the explicit dialogue between the daughter and father.

Question:
Fahmida was __________ to see a foreigner singing a song about Bangladesh.

Options:
a. disappointed
b. amazed
c. confused
d. angry


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: বাক্যে সূচক হচ্ছে — “a foreigner singing a song about Bangladesh” — যা অপ্রত্যাশিত এবং ইতিবাচক বিস্ময়ের মতো দেখায়।  
ধাপ ২: এসব অবস্থা বোঝায় যে ফাহমিদা হতবাক বা বিস্মিত হয়েছিল, তাই সঠিক শব্দ হলো "amazed" (বিকল্প b)।  
বাকিগুলো ভুল কারণ "disappointed" ও "angry" নেতিবাচক অনুভূতি নির্দেশ করে এবং "confused" আর্থবোধ বা বিভ্রান্তি বোঝায়, যা এখানে পরিপ্রেক্ষিতের সঙ্গে খাপ খায় না।

Question:
What did Fahmida want to know about the singer?

Options:


Correct Answer: She wanted to know who he was and why he sang about Bangladesh.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Locate Fahmida’s questions in the text — she directly asks about the singer’s identity and the reason for his songs about Bangladesh.  
Step 2: From those questions we conclude her twofold curiosity: she wanted to know who he was and why he sang about Bangladesh.  
Other answer choices that mention only one of these points (for example, asking just his name or just his background) are incomplete, so the correct choice is that she wanted to know both who he was and why he sang about Bangladesh.

Step 1: স্মরণ করে নিন—প্রশ্নে বলা আছে মি. ফারহাদ ফাহমিদাকে জর্জ হ্যারিসন সম্পর্কে কী বলেছিলেন। তিনি বলেন জর্জ হ্যারিসন ছিলেন ইংল্যান্ডের একজন এবং মুক্তিযুদ্ধের সময় সাহায্য করেছিলেন।

অপর অপশনগুলোর ত্রুটি: (a) ভুল—তিনি আফ্রিকান গায়ক নন; (c) ভুল—তিনি রাজনীতিবিদ ছিলেন না; (d) ভুল—তিনি বাংলাদেশের জন্য গান ও কনসার্টের মাধ্যমে সচেতনতা ও সাহায্য করেছেন।
