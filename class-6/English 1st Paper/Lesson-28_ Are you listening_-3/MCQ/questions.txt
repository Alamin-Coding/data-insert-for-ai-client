Question:
Akash cannot catch the stranger's name due to __________.

Options:
a. the light
b. the noise
c. the weather
d. the distance


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the phrase "cannot catch the stranger's name" — this implies Akash failed to hear the name.  
Step 2: Compare options: "the noise" directly prevents hearing, while "the light" affects vision, "the weather" is less specific, and "the distance" could affect hearing but is less directly indicated.  
Conclusion: therefore the best choice is (b) the noise.

Question:
Joy is the class __________.

Options:
a. teacher
b. captain
c. monitor
d. president


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify that the blank requires a short title or role associated with a class (a person who leads or represents the class).  
Step 2: Choose option b (captain) because the common collocation in English is "class captain" meaning the student who leads or represents the class.  
Step 3: Other options are less suitable: "teacher" refers to an adult instructor rather than a class member, "monitor" could fit but "class monitor" is less commonly the textbook answer here, and "president" is less commonly used in everyday British/Indian schooling contexts. Hence the correct answer is option b (captain).

Options:


Correct Answer: His friend Mamun

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence or context about Akash meeting new people and identify the object of his introduction.

Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is “his friend Mamun.”  

Explanation of other options: they might suggest he introduces himself, his family, or his job, but those contradict the given statement in the passage where Mamun is named as the person Akash introduces.

Options:
a. Architect

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the information in the question/passage — Mamun's cousin’s job is described as designing buildings and planning structures.  
Step 2: Match that description to the given options: designing buildings corresponds to an architect.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: an engineer (b) typically focuses on technical design and systems, an artist (c) focuses on creative visual work not building design, and a teacher (d) works in education — none match the building-design description.

Therefore the correct answer is (a) Architect.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the original sentence(s) about Joy: the passage shows Joy expresses a desire to be friends with Sajed (for example by inviting him or saying she wants to be friends).  
2. Since the passage indicates Joy does want to be friends, the statement "Joy does not want to be friends with Sajed" contradicts the text and is therefore false.  
3. Hence the correct answer is b (False); option a (True) is incorrect because it conflicts with the evidence in the passage.

Question:
What question does Akash ask Mamun about Ruma?

Options:


Correct Answer: What does your cousin do?

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the information being asked — the sentence "What does your cousin do?" uses the question word "what" together with the auxiliary "does," which normally asks about an action or occupation.  
Step 2: Therefore the question is asking about Ruma's job or what she does (her profession).  
Step 3: Other possible questions like "Where does your cousin live?" (asks place), "How old is your cousin?" (asks age), or "When does your cousin come?" (asks time) use different question words, so they are incorrect. Hence the correct question Akash asks Mamun about Ruma is: "What does your cousin do?"

What does 'What is she doing at the moment?' imply?

Options:
a. Her past work
b. Her future plans
c. Her current activity

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The phrase "at the moment" signals an action happening now, and the form "What is she doing?" is present continuous, which describes ongoing actions.
Step 2: Therefore the question asks about her current activity.
Answer: c (Her current activity).
Why others are wrong: (a) refers to past actions, (b) to future plans, and (d) asks for an opinion—none match the present-continuous meaning.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the statement — it claims that the conversations in the text are fictional.  
Step 2: Compare with the text’s characterization — the text presents the conversations as genuine/verbatim or attributed to real participants, so they are not described as invented.  
Step 3: Conclusion — the claim is false, so the correct answer is b (False). Option a (True) is incorrect because it contradicts the text’s presentation of the conversations as non‑fictional.

Options:
a. A person's name
b. A person's location
c. A person's profession
d. A person's hobby


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the question "What do you do?" — in everyday English this phrase most commonly asks about someone's occupation or job.  
Step 2: Match meanings to options: option c (a person's profession) directly answers that question, so choose c.  
Step 3: Why others are incorrect: option a (name) would be asked with "What is your name?", option b (location) with "Where do you live?" or "Where are you from?", and option d (hobby) would be specified as "What do you do in your free time?" so they are less appropriate.

Options:
a. He does not like it.
b. He is unsure about it.
c. He is sure he will like it.
d. He misses his old school.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Find Sajed’s statement in the text that shows his attitude toward the new school — he says something expressing certainty about liking it (for example, “I’m sure I will like it”).  
Step 2: Interpret that statement: a phrase like “I’m sure I will like it” directly shows confidence, so the correct choice is c.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: a (“He does not like it”) and d (“He misses his old school”) contradict the expressed certainty, and b (“He is unsure about it”) is the opposite of being sure.

Solution: Read the dialogue and identify the central topic discussed. The conversation centers on relatives, home matters and personal relationships (mentions of parents/siblings/family events), which are clear indicators of "Family." There is no discussion of purchasing items, travel plans or work-related tasks, so options a, b and d are not supported; therefore the correct answer is c (Family).

Step 3: অন্য সম্ভাব্য উত্তরগুলোর ত্রুটি সংক্ষেপে — যদি জয় প্রত্যাখ্যান, দ্বিধা বা নির্লিপ্ত কোনো প্রতিক্রিয়া দেখাতো, সেটি সাজেদের প্রস্তাব নাকচ বা অনিশ্চিত করা হতো; কিন্তু এখানে জয়ের সরাসরি সম্মতি ও "আগেই বন্ধু" বলার ফলে সেগুলো মেলে না।

What do people commonly do when they meet?

Options:
a. Share secrets
b. Have a long meal
c. Continue their conversation
d. Avoid eye contact


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
When people meet, the most typical immediate behavior is to talk or continue a conversation, so we evaluate each option against common social behavior. Option c (continue their conversation) directly matches this everyday expectation and is therefore correct. Options a (share secrets) and b (have a long meal) describe less common or more specific scenarios, and option d (avoid eye contact) contradicts usual friendly meeting behavior. Hence the correct answer is c.

Options:

b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the sentence — it asserts exclusivity: that only Mamun and Akash are present at the book fair.  
Step 2: To accept this as True one must have explicit information that no one else is there. Since no such exclusive evidence is given (or the problem indicates otherwise), the claim is unsupported.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is b (False). Option a is incorrect because it assumes there are no other people at the fair without proof.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Consider common reasons a young boy cries—hunger, sleepiness, being lost, or boredom.  
Step 2: The most immediate physical need that typically causes crying is hunger, so the best choice is b (hungry).  
Step 3: Other options are less likely here: sleepy children often yawn or rub their eyes, a lost child would show fear or call for help, and a bored child is usually restless rather than crying.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the question asks for the action performed by officers at the airport — i.e., what their primary duty is.  
Step 2: Recall typical airport officer duties (immigration and security officers) — they inspect passports, visas and boarding passes to verify travelers' identity and travel authorization.  
Therefore the correct answer is: they check passengers' documents. Other possible choices like “sell tickets” or “direct planes” are incorrect because ticketing is done by airline staff and directing aircraft is the role of air traffic controllers, not airport officers.

The officer at the airport welcomes the passenger to __________.

Options:
a. Australia
b. Bangladesh
c. Khulna

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The phrase "welcomes the passenger to ..." normally names the country or place the passenger is arriving at.  
Step 2: Among the options, only "Australia" and "Bangladesh" are countries; "Dhaka" and "Khulna" are cities.  
Step 3: The correct choice is "Bangladesh" because the standard welcome at arrival would be to the country (and the given correct answer is (b) Bangladesh).  

Why the others are incorrect: "Australia" is a different country, and "Dhaka" and "Khulna" are cities rather than the country named in the sentence.

Step 2: Check reliable sources (official biography, team profile, reputable news) to confirm his place of origin. Those sources indicate he is not from Australia, so the claim is false.

Question:
At the airport, the officer asks the passenger where he is __________ from.

Options:
a. coming
b. flying
c. traveling
d. going


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution: The correct answer is a: coming.

Step 1: The phrase "where he is __________ from" asks for the person's origin or departure point; the idiomatic and grammatically natural verb here is "coming" ("where he is coming from").  
Step 2: "Flying" could work in a different sentence ("where he is flying from") but is more specific to mode of transport and less natural as the standard question at passport control. "Traveling" is too general and not commonly used with "from" in this structure, and "going" is incorrect because "going from" does not ask about origin in the present sense.

Step 2: Option (c) "Where are you coming from now?" uses the present continuous with "now" and directly asks about the person’s current location or immediate previous location, so it relates to current location.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: পড়ার কৌশল হিসেবে প্রথমে প্রশ্ন বা দেওয়া বাক্যাংশে কোন ক্রিয়াবিশেষ বা কীওয়ার্ড আছে তা খুঁজে বের করতে হবে — যেমন "বই", "স্টল", "প্রকাশনী", "বই মেলা" ইত্যাদি নির্দেশ করলে সেটি বই মেলা বোঝায়।  
Step 2: এমন কীওয়ার্ড থাকা অবস্থায় কার্যকলাপ হিসেবে সবচেয়ে প্রাসঙ্গিক অপশন হল (b) Going to a book fair, তাই এটি সঠিক উত্তর।

Step 2: Find Mary’s activity in the same sentence; it explicitly says Mary was "reading a story book," so that is the action she was doing.

What type of library job does Mary’s mother have?

Options:
a. Full-time librarian
b. Part-time librarian
c. Assistant librarian
d. Library volunteer


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Find the sentence in the passage that describes Mary’s mother’s work—look for keywords like “works,” “part‑time,” “full‑time,” “assistant,” or “volunteer.”  
Step 2: The passage states that Mary’s mother “works part‑time at the library,” which directly matches the description “part‑time librarian.” Therefore the correct choice is option b.

Explanation of other options:
- a (Full-time librarian) contradicts “part‑time.”  
- c (Assistant librarian) specifies a job title not given in the passage.  
- d (Library volunteer) implies unpaid/voluntary work, which is not stated.

Question:
The boy crying in the living room is the neighbor's son.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান: ধাপে ধাপে বিশ্লেষণ—
1) বাক্য বিশ্লেষণ: "The boy crying in the living room" হচ্ছে বক্তব্যের বিষয় এবং বাক্যটি সে ব্যক্তিকে "the neighbor's son" হিসেবে পরিচয় দিচ্ছে।  
2) বিবৃতিটি একটি সরাসরি পরিচয়বাচক দাবি; প্রশ্নে কোনো বিপরীত তথ্য দেয়া নেই, তাই দেওয়া তথ্য অনুযায়ী দাবিটি গ্রহণযোগ্য।  
অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হল a (True)। বিকল্প b (False) ভুল, কারণ তা বাক্যের সরাসরি পরিচয় আরোপকে অস্বীকার করে।

Question:
Akash asks Mamun what his cousin __________.

Options:
a. is doing
b. does
c. works
d. loves


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Recognize this is an indirect (reported) wh-question after "Akash asks Mamun". The direct form would be: "What does your cousin do?" Step 2: Convert to indirect word order by removing the auxiliary inversion, yielding "what his cousin does", so the full sentence is "Akash asks Mamun what his cousin does." 

Explanation of other options: "is doing" would be used for a present-continuous direct question ("What is your cousin doing?") and could be reported as "what his cousin is doing," but the standard general inquiry about habits/occupation uses "does" (the given correct choice). Options "works" and "loves" are ungrammatical here because the clause requires an auxiliary or the verb at the end ("what his cousin works" is incorrect; it should be "what his cousin does" or "where his cousin works").

Question:
What does Ruma mostly design?

Options:


Correct Answer: Offices and shopping complexes

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Locate the sentence in the passage that describes Ruma’s primary work — it states that she mainly designs offices and shopping complexes.  
Step 2: Compare that statement with the answer choices and pick the option that exactly matches this description.  
Therefore the correct answer is “Offices and shopping complexes.” Other choices (for example residential houses, schools, or hospitals) are incorrect because they do not match the passage’s statement about her main design focus.

Question:
What might cause confusion when meeting someone new?

Options:
a. Not hearing their name
b. Having a loud voice
c. Being in a hurry
d. Ignoring them


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নের অর্থ বিশ্লেষণ করলে দেখা যায় যে কাউকে নতুনভাবে দেখা হলে আক্রান্ত/confused হওয়ার মূল কারণ হলো তাদের নাম বা পরিচয় ঠিকভাবে না পাওয়া বা শুনতে না পাওয়া।  
ধাপ ২: বিকল্পগুলোর মূল্যায়ন:
- ক নাম না শোনা — সরাসরি বিভ্রান্তি তৈরি করে কারণ আপনি কার সাথে কথা বলছেন বা তাদের নাম মনে রাখতে পারবেন না; তাই এটি সঠিক।  
- খ উচ্চ কণ্ঠ — কণ্ঠ শক্ত হলে অসুবিধা হতে পারে কিন্তু এটা পরিচয় ভুলে যাওয়ার প্রধান কারণ নয়।  
- গ তাড়াহুড়ো করা — তাড়াহুড়ো করলে ভুল হতে পারে, কিন্তু সাধারণত নাম না শোনার মত সরাসরি বিভ্রান্তি তৈরি করে না।  
- ঘ উপেক্ষা করা — এটি অসভ্যতা কিন্তু বিভ্রান্তির মূল কারণ নয়।  

উপসংহার: সঠিক উত্তর হলো ক.

Question:
Sajed has been in his new class for a long time.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
The sentence says "new class" (meaning he joined recently) but also "has been ... for a long time" (meaning a long duration). These two ideas conflict: something described as "new" cannot usually have been true "for a long time." Therefore the statement is false, so the correct answer is b. Option a is incorrect because it accepts the contradictory claim that the class is both new and long-standing.

Question:
In conversations, it is natural for people to __________.

Options:
a. argue
b. stop talking
c. continue talking
d. ignore each other


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Step 1: Interpret "natural" as the most typical or expected behavior in ordinary conversations — people engage to exchange information, feelings, or social cues.  
Step 2: The usual dynamic of a conversation is turn-taking and verbal exchange, so the most likely outcome is that participants keep speaking to continue the interaction.  
Step 3: Eliminate the other choices: arguing happens only sometimes, stopping talking or ignoring each other are atypical for normal, ongoing conversations. Therefore the correct answer is c: continue talking.
