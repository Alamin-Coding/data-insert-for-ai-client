Question:
What similarities can be drawn between the descriptions of the busy railway station and the lively school environment Tarun encountered?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
State the core similarity first, then support it by identifying parallel elements (people, activities, sensory cues, social interactions) and showing how each element in the railway-station description maps to the school environment Tarun encountered.

Essential steps (working steps):
1. Identify features of the busy railway station: many people, movement, conversations, announcements, vendors/officials, routines (arrivals/departures), and an energetic atmosphere.
2. Identify features of the lively school environment: many students and staff, movement between classes, conversations and play, announcements or bells, canteen/administrative activity, and a bustling atmosphere.
3. Compare corresponding features to highlight commonalities: who is present, what they are doing, how they interact, and the overall mood.
4. Draw the conclusion that both settings generate liveliness through collective human activity and social interaction.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Social interaction: Groups of people communicating and coordinating create a visible sense of life.
- Collective activity and routines: Repeated events (trains/classes, announcements/bells) organize people’s actions and produce rhythm and movement.
- Sensory cues and atmosphere: Sounds (voices, announcements, bells), movement, and visual crowding are common markers of a lively setting.
- Functional roles: Different people (vendors/railway staff vs. teachers/administration) contribute to the setting’s activity and order.

Logical reasoning (mapping parallels):
- Crowd and movement: Commuters moving across platforms correspond to students moving between classes or playing; both involve purposeful motion and flow.
- Communication and noise: Station announcements and passenger conversations mirror school bells, teacher calls, and student chatter—both create an audible backdrop of activity.
- Service and roles: Vendors and ticket staff at a station are analogous to canteen workers, clerks, and teachers—each group performs tasks that keep the place functioning.
- Routine structure: Train schedules and platform changes are like class timetables and recess periods—structured events that concentrate activity at particular times.
- Social interaction and energy: In both places people meet, talk, wait, hurry, help each other, and the combined behaviors produce a lively, social environment.

Example (brief, illustrative):
- Announcement at station ↔ School bell: each signals transitions and prompts collective movement.
- Vendors/queues ↔ Canteen/lines: people gather for food or services, creating clustered activity.

Conclusion:
Both the busy railway station and Tarun’s lively school share the key similarity of being populated spaces where many people engage in various activities, producing movement, noise, routines, and social interaction that create a vivid sense of liveliness.

Explanation:
Both descriptions emphasize many people performing different actions, which produces a lively, bustling atmosphere and frequent social interactions. The underlying idea is that scenes become "lively" when movement, noise, and people’s interactions are highlighted, so both the railway station and the school convey the same social energy.

Question:
What can be inferred about the atmosphere at the railway station based on the speaker's observations?

Options:


Correct Answer: The atmosphere was busy and crowded, with various groups of people engaged in different activities.

Solution:
Solution approach:
1) Extract the concrete observations the speaker mentions (who was present, what they were doing, sensory details).  
2) Group those observations into themes (crowding, activity level, noise/motion).  
3) Infer the overall atmosphere from those themes.

Essential steps and reasoning:
- Step 1 — Identify observations: The speaker notes many people at the station (passengers, porters, vendors, families, officials), people moving about, calls/announcements, loading and unloading luggage, people waiting, and groups engaged in distinct tasks.  
- Step 2 — Translate observations into attributes: Multiple groups and simultaneous actions imply high occupancy (crowded) and continuous movement (busy). Audible cues like calls or announcements and visible movement indicate noise and bustle. The presence of vendors and porters shows commercial and logistical activity in addition to travel-related waiting.  
- Step 3 — Combine attributes to infer atmosphere: Because many people and activities coexist and interact, the overall atmosphere is one of hustle and crowding — lively, noisy, and active rather than quiet or deserted.

Relevant concepts:
- Convergence of agents: When many different roles (travelers, workers, sellers) are present, the environment tends toward complexity and activity.  
- Multi-sensory cues: Visual movement and auditory signals (announcements, shouting) both support an inference of busyness.

Conclusion:
From the speaker’s observations, the railway station’s atmosphere can be inferred to be busy and crowded, with various groups of people engaged in different activities, producing a noisy, bustling environment.

Explanation:
The speaker mentions many people, porters with luggage, vendors, and groups hurrying or talking, which directly shows the station was crowded and busy with different activities. From these concrete details we infer the overall atmosphere as bustling and active.

Question:
What was the reason for the speaker's visit to the railway station?

Options:


Correct Answer: To see off his friend Sajjad.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach:
- Identify the speaker’s purpose from contextual clues in the text (actions, verbs, references to departure) and infer the motive that best fits those clues.

Essential working steps:
1. Note any explicit statements: if the passage mentions the speaker going to the railway station when Sajjad’s train was leaving, that is a direct indicator.
2. Look for actions associated with farewells (walking to platform, helping with luggage, saying goodbye, seeing the train depart).
3. Eliminate alternative reasons (e.g., catching a train himself, meeting someone else) if the text makes them unlikely or absent.
4. Combine the clues to form the simplest, coherent explanation.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Use of textual evidence: rely on explicit statements or strongly implied actions.
- Occam’s razor (simplicity): prefer the straightforward motive that fits the details.
- Contextual inference: derive intention from described behavior.

Logical reasoning:
- The speaker went to the station at the time Sajjad was leaving and performed farewell-type actions → these facts point to a farewell purpose.
- No evidence suggests the speaker intended to travel or meet someone else → those possibilities can be ruled out.
- Therefore the most consistent and supported reason is that the speaker went to see off Sajjad.

Final answer:
The speaker visited the railway station to see off his friend Sajjad.

Explanation:
Explanation: The passage explicitly says the speaker went with Sajjad to the station and bade him farewell, so his purpose was to see off his friend Sajjad. Key idea: infer the reason from the actions and direct statements in the text.

- ক্রমচিহ্নকরণ (প্রথমে, তারপর, শেষে) ব্যবহার করে কাহিনী সাজান।
- সময় ও ক্রিয়ার উপযুক্ত কালের ব্যবহার নিশ্চিত করুন (বিগত ঘটনা হলে অতীতকাল)।
- সংক্ষিপ্তউদ্ধৃতি বা সরল বাক্য দিয়ে মূল তথ্য রাখুন; অপ্রয়োজনীয় বিবরণ এড়িয়ে চলুন।

সংক্ষিপ্ত উদাহরণ (তিনটি অংশ দেখানোর জন্য):
- তারা কি দেখেছে: "বাজারে разно রঙের স্টল, ফলের তাজা ढের এবং মানুষের ভিড় দেখতে পাচ্ছিলাম।"
- সেখানে কি ঘটছিল: "বিক্রেতারা কণ্ঠে মূল্য ডেকছিলেন, কিছু লোক দরদাম করছিল এবং একটি ফুটপাথের কৌতুকপ্রদর্শন চলছিল।"
- তারা কি করেছে: "আমরা একটি স্টল থেকে লুঙ্গি কিনে চা খেতে বসেছিলাম এবং মেলায় গান শুনেছি।"

উপরোক্ত পদ্ধতি অনুসরণ করলে বর্ণনা সুসংগঠিত, স্পষ্ট ও প্রাঞ্জল হবে — দেখা, ঘটমান ঘটনা ও ব্যক্তিগত কার্যকলাপের সমন্বয়ে পাঠক সহজেই সেই স্থানের চিত্র অনুভব করতে পারবে।

Explanation:
This is correct because a good description combines observations (what they saw), activities or events (what was happening), and personal actions (what they did), which together create a clear, vivid picture. Include sensory details, simple verbs and time words to keep the account organized and easy to imagine.

Question:
What happened as soon as Sajjad's train started to leave?

Options:


Correct Answer: He picked up his suitcase and they said goodbye.

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Identify the temporal connector "as soon as" which signals an immediate sequence of events.
- Find the actions linked to that connector and read the main clause to see what happened at that moment.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The phrase "as soon as Sajjad's train started to leave" sets the time point — the moment the train began to move.
2. The main clause tied to that time point states the actions that occurred immediately: Sajjad "picked up his suitcase" and "they said goodbye."
3. Because "as soon as" denotes immediacy, these actions happened right at the moment the train started to leave.

Conclusion:
- As soon as the train began to move, Sajjad picked up his suitcase and they said goodbye.

Relevant concept:
- Temporal conjunctions (like "as soon as") link a time condition to actions and indicate that the actions occur immediately when that time condition is met. For example: "As soon as the bell rang, we left" shows the leaving happened immediately after the bell rang.

Explanation:
Explanation: The phrase "as soon as" signals actions that occur immediately at that moment, and the passage shows that at the moment the train began to move Sajjad picked up his suitcase and they said goodbye. Thus those two actions are the direct, immediate events described.

Question:
What did the speaker and his friend do near the newspaper stall?

Options:


Correct Answer: Talked and watched the crowd.

Solution:
Solution:

Approach:
Read the relevant sentence(s) in the passage that describe the actions taken near the newspaper stall. Identify the verbs and objects that state what the speaker and his friend did.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Locate the line in the passage mentioning the newspaper stall — this is the context for the question.
2. Parse the sentence to find the actions performed by the speaker and his friend. Look for verbs that describe activities (for example, "talked", "watched", "stood", "waited").
3. Note any objects or phrases that complete those actions (for example, "the crowd", "each other", "the passersby") to understand what they were doing.

Application to this question:
- The passage states that the speaker and his friend stood near the newspaper stall, engaged in conversation and observed people passing by.
- From that wording we identify the two actions: they "talked" and they "watched the crowd."

Answer:
They talked and watched the crowd.

Explanation:
The passage explicitly says the speaker and his friend stood by the newspaper stall, chatted and looked at the people around them, so their actions were “talked” and “watched the crowd.” To answer, locate the sentence describing what they did and use those verbs as the response.

Question:
What was the young lady doing on the bench?

Options:


Correct Answer: Reading a magazine.

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — use observable contextual clues to infer the activity.

Step 1: Identify the object in her hands and its appearance — glossy pages, colorful pictures, a visible cover or headlines suggest a magazine rather than a book or a phone.

Step 2: Note her posture and gaze — eyes directed downward at the object, hands holding and possibly turning pages indicate reading.

Step 3: Observe motion and interaction — flipping pages, relaxed leisure position on a bench, and lack of typing or scrolling motions support that she is reading printed material.

Step 4: Rule out alternatives — if it were a phone you would see tapping or a smaller dark rectangle; if it were a book the pages and binding would look different; if it were a newspaper the paper would be thinner and larger.

Conclusion — combining these clues, the most consistent inference is that the young lady was reading a magazine.

Explanation:
She was reading a magazine because the picture shows her holding an open magazine and looking at its pages on the bench. Use visual cues like objects people hold and where they are looking to identify actions in such questions.

Question:
What did the old couple try to do at the station?

Options:


Correct Answer: Find a quiet place to sit down and rest.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer: They tried to find a quiet place to sit down and rest.

Approach:
- Use context clues from the passage or question about the couple’s actions and needs.
- Identify key words indicating their state (e.g., tired, old, looking around, benches) and the setting (station, busy, noisy).

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Observe the couple’s condition: being described as “old” implies they are more likely to need rest and prefer comfort.
2. Note their behavior at the station: if they were searching, looking for seats, or moving away from crowds, these actions point to seeking somewhere to sit.
3. Combine clues: a busy station is often noisy and crowded; an elderly couple looking around would reasonably try to locate a quieter spot where they can sit and rest.
4. Conclude by inference: the most logical purpose of their searching at the station is to find a quiet place to sit down and rest.

Concepts used:
- Inference from context: reading actions and descriptors to determine intent.
- Practical reasoning: matching likely needs (rest) to actions (searching for a seat).

This yields the concise answer: they tried to find a quiet place to sit down and rest.

Explanation:
They tried to find a quiet place to sit down and rest. We infer this because their behavior—looking for a seat away from crowds and noise—shows they wanted to be comfortable and recover energy.

Question:
What were the young people doing in front of the tea stall?

Options:


Correct Answer: Talking loudly and drinking tea.

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — use direct observation and simple inference from the scene. Identify visible actions (objects, sounds, gestures) and connect them to likely activities.

Step 1 — Observe evidence:
- Presence of cups or saucers, steam, or people holding cups indicates drinking tea.
- Raised voices, overlapping speech, laughter or people gesturing toward each other indicate they were talking loudly.

Step 2 — Infer actions:
- When people at a tea stall hold cups and bring them to their mouths repeatedly, the reasonable conclusion is they are drinking tea.
- When multiple voices are audible and conversation is animated, the correct inference is they are talking loudly.

Conclusion:
The young people in front of the tea stall were talking loudly and drinking tea. This follows directly from the observable clues (cups/tea and loud conversation) and simple logical inference.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer is "talking loudly and drinking tea" because the description directly states the young people were conversing loudly and sipping tea at the stall. To choose such answers, pick the option that exactly matches the actions explicitly described in the passage.

Question:
Who was holding a child's hand tightly?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Identify the action described (“holding a child’s hand tightly”) and then determine which person in the scene or sentence is performing that action. Use direct observation and elimination of other possible agents.

Working steps:
1. Locate the child in the scene or passage.
2. Observe which nearby person is physically connected to the child’s hand.
3. Note the manner of the grip (described as “tightly”) and confirm it matches the posture or gesture of that person.
4. Check nearby people to rule out others—if no one else is touching the child’s hand, they can be excluded.

Logical reasoning:
- The action requires physical contact; therefore the agent must be the person whose hand is visibly holding the child’s hand.
- Among the people present, only one person satisfies that condition. The description specifies a person standing in the queue who is holding the child’s hand tightly.
- By direct observation and elimination of other candidates, the agent is the woman standing in the queue.

Final answer:
- A woman standing in the queue.

Question:
What was happening at the ticket counter?

Options:


Correct Answer: There was a long line of people.

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Look for observable cues in the scene (words or descriptions that indicate crowding, waiting, or many people) and interpret them using common-sense knowledge about how ticket counters operate.

Step 1: Identify textual/visual cues such as “many people,” “people waiting,” “crowded,” “people standing in a row,” or “people waiting their turn.” These phrases directly signal queuing.

Step 2: Use common-sense inference: when multiple people gather at a ticket counter and are described as waiting or standing one after another, the natural interpretation is that they form a line and are waiting to be served.

Step 3: Conclude from those cues that the situation at the ticket counter was a long queue of people waiting to buy tickets.

Reasoning and principle — The principle is simple: ticket counters serve one customer (or a few) at a time, so when many customers are present and described as waiting, they must be arranged in a line. Therefore, the correct answer, “There was a long line of people,” follows directly from the observed indicators of crowding and waiting.

Explanation:
The correct answer is "There was a long line of people" because the scene shows many people queued up and waiting at the ticket counter. To answer "what was happening," you identify the main activity being described—people standing in a queue—so "a long line of people" best matches that observation.

Question:
What was Sajjad's destination?

Options:


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Approach — Use straightforward information extraction: scan the given text or data for an explicit statement or reliable clue (e.g., a sentence, ticket detail, or dialogue) that names Sajjad’s destination.
2. Working steps —
   - Locate the sentence or item that refers to Sajjad’s travel plans.
   - Confirm that the place named is unambiguous and consistently supported by any other clues.
   - If multiple sources agree, accept that place as the destination.
3. Reasoning — The question’s source explicitly identifies Sajjad’s destination; no inference beyond reading that statement is needed. Cross-checking with any accompanying details (ticket, itinerary, or conversation) would only reinforce the same conclusion.
Answer: Dhaka.

Explanation:
Explanation: The passage explicitly states that Sajjad was traveling to Dhaka, so Dhaka is his destination. The question asks where he was going, and the text directly identifies Dhaka as the answer.
