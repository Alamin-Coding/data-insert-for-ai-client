Question:
In what ways do the descriptions of crowded environments in Tarun's school and the railway station reflect the characters' feelings?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Identify how physical details of each crowded place (school, railway station) are presented.
- Relate those sensory details and narrative tone to the characters’ inner states.
- Use literary principles (imagery, tone, focalization, setting-as-mood) to show the link between environment and feeling.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Note the sensory details used for each setting:
   - School: descriptions of jostling corridors, noise of many children, unfamiliar faces, cramped space. These sensory cues highlight confusion, claustrophobia and social pressure.
   - Railway station: crowd, rush of travelers, loud announcements, strangers moving purposefully. These cues emphasize bewilderment, transience and a sense of being small or lost in a larger world.

2. Apply relevant concepts:
   - Imagery and sensory detail: concrete sights, sounds, and physical sensations make the reader feel the characters’ discomfort.
   - Focalization (point of view): when descriptions are filtered through a character’s perception, the environment mirrors their emotional state.
   - Setting as mood (a form of pathetic fallacy or symbolic setting): the crowded spaces symbolize psychological states—overwhelm, anxiety, uncertainty.

3. Link specific environmental features to emotions:
   - Tight spaces and pushing → feeling physically overwhelmed and emotionally claustrophobic.
   - Loud, confusing noise → internal disorientation, nervousness.
   - Many unfamiliar faces/strangers → loneliness, insecurity, need to adjust socially.
   - Movement and rush at the station → sense of transition, recognition that one must adapt to change.

4. Compare both settings:
   - Common emphasis: both places use crowding and sensory overload to convey similar feelings—overwhelm and the challenge of adjusting to a new situation.
   - Difference in nuance: the school scene may stress social anxiety and immediate adjustment among peers; the railway station may add a layer of existential smallness and the uncertainty of travel/transition. Both, however, reinforce the same core emotional response.

Concise conclusion:
- Through vivid sensory detail, tone, and character-focused description, both the school and the railway station portray crowdedness in a way that reflects and intensifies the characters’ feelings of overwhelm and the need to adjust to new circumstances.

Explanation:
Both descriptions use sensory details—noise, jostling, and packed spaces—to show the characters’ sensory overload and discomfort, signaling that they feel overwhelmed. By making the surroundings chaotic and unfamiliar, the passages mirror the characters’ internal struggle to adjust to a new situation.

Question:
What similarities can be drawn between Tarun's feelings on his first school day and Sajjad's departure at the railway station?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
1. Identify the emotions expressed by Tarun on his first day at school and by Sajjad at the railway station.
2. Extract concrete signs or lines that show those emotions (anticipation, nervousness, etc.).
3. Compare the emotional elements to find commonalities and summarize the shared emotional experience.

Essential steps and working:
1. Read the relevant passages carefully to note phrases or actions that reveal feelings (e.g., a quickened heartbeat, hesitance, bright eyes, reluctant goodbyes).
2. List Tarun’s emotions: excitement (eagerness to start, curiosity about new things), apprehension (nervousness about strangers, fear of the unknown).
3. List Sajjad’s emotions: excitement (journey ahead, new opportunities), apprehension (sorrow at parting, anxiety about change).
4. Match items from both lists to see overlap: both show anticipation for what comes next and anxiety about leaving familiar people or stepping into new situations.
5. Form a concise comparative statement summarizing the similarity.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Emotional ambivalence: people often feel mixed, even contradictory emotions (e.g., joy and fear) during transitions.
- Transition/rite-of-passage reactions: starting school or leaving by train are transitional events that commonly trigger both excitement and apprehension.
- Separation anxiety and anticipation: both arise when leaving a familiar environment and facing novelty simultaneously.

Logical reasoning and conclusion:
- Both scenarios are transitional moments: Tarun’s first school day and Sajjad’s departure involve moving from a known situation to an uncertain one.
- Transitional moments typically produce mixed emotions because they carry potential for positive experiences (learning, adventure) and potential losses or risks (separation, unfamiliarity).
- Therefore, the clear similarity is that both characters experience a blend of excitement (for new possibilities) and apprehension (about separation and the unknown).

Concise answer:
Both Tarun and Sajjad feel a mixture of excitement and apprehension — eagerness about the new experience combined with nervousness or sadness about leaving familiar people or entering an uncertain situation.

Explanation:
Both Tarun on his first school day and Sajjad at the railway station are facing new beginnings and uncertainty, which naturally create both excitement about what lies ahead and apprehension about change or separation. Such transitional moments commonly produce a mixed emotional response—hopeful anticipation alongside nervous worry.

Question:
What activity were the young people doing in front of the tea stall at the railway station?

Options:
a. Eating snacks.
b. Talking loudly and drinking tea.
c. Waiting for their train.
d. Reading newspapers.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
উত্তর: (b) Talking loudly and drinking tea — তরুণরা চা খাচ্ছিল এবং জোরে কথা বলছিল।

উত্তর গ্রহণের পদ্ধতি ও ধাপসমূহ:
1. প্রশ্নের বিবরণ মনোযোগ দিয়ে পড়া: স্থানের বর্ণনা — রেল স্টেশনের চা দোকানের সামনে তরুণদের কর্মকাণ্ড জানতে চাইছে।
2. বাক্য/বর্ণনায় শব্দভাণ্ডার খুঁজে বের করা: এখানে যে ক্রিয়াগুলো বর্ণিত আছে—চা পান করা এবং জোরে কথোপকথন করা—সেগুলো সরাসরি (b) অপশনের সঙ্গে মিলে যায়।
3. বাকি অপশনগুলিকে পর্যালোচনা করে বাতিল করা:
   - (a) Eating snacks — যদি অবশ্যই নাহলে উল্লেখ না থাকে; তাই অসমর্থিত।
   - (c) Waiting for their train — রেল স্টেশনে হলেও প্রশ্নে অপেক্ষার কথা বলা হয়নি।
   - (d) Reading newspapers — এটা উল্লেখ করা হয়নি।
4. উপসংহার: সরাসরি মিল থাকা ক্রিয়ার জন্য (b) সঠিক অপশন নির্বাচন করা হয়েছে।

যুক্তিসংগত বিবৃতি: প্রশ্নের বর্ণনা যদি বলছে “চা দোকানের সামনে তরুণেরা চা খাচ্ছিল ও জোরে কথা বলছিল”, তাহলে স্পষ্টভাবে (b) হল সঠিক উত্তর।

Explanation:
The correct answer is b because the passage explicitly describes the young people standing in front of the tea stall, talking loudly and drinking tea; those direct details rule out eating, waiting for a train, or reading newspapers.

Question:
What was happening at the railway station when the speaker was there?

Options:
a. It was completely empty.
b. People were boarding trains quietly.
c. There was a crowd and people were interacting.
d. Everyone was sleeping.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- Read the relevant description of the railway station and extract key sensory details (sight, sound, activity).
- Use elimination: compare those details with each option to find the best match.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Identify clues: the speaker notes many people, noise, movement and interactions (vendors calling, passengers talking or hurrying). These details point to an active, busy scene rather than silence or uniform behavior.
2. Compare with options:
   - a (completely empty): contradicts presence of people and noise — eliminate.
   - b (people boarding trains quietly): “quietly” contradicts the described noise and interactions — eliminate.
   - c (there was a crowd and people were interacting): directly matches the observed crowd, voices, and exchanges — fits.
   - d (everyone was sleeping): contradicts visible activity — eliminate.
3. Conclude by choosing the option that best fits all observed details.

Final answer: c — There was a crowd and people were interacting.

Explanation:
The correct answer is (c) because the passage describes a busy, lively station with many people talking, moving and interacting rather than being empty, quiet, or asleep. The key idea is that crowd noises and people’s interactions show activity and presence of many passengers.
