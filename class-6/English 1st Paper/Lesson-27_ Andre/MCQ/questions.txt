Options:
a. Both felt alone and neglected.
b. Both found the people around them friendly and engaging.
c. Tarun was excited while the speaker was bored.
d. Both faced a chaotic environment but had different emotional responses.


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
সমাধান:
প্রথম ধাপ: প্রশ্নে দেখা যায় টটকা পরিবেশে উভয় ক্ষেত্রেই বিশৃঙ্খলা, ভিড় বা ব্যস্ততা ছিল — স্কুলে তরুণদের উচ্ছ্বাস ও ধাক্কাধাক্কি, রেলস্টেশনে ভিড় ও অস্থিরতা।  
দ্বিতীয় ধাপ: কিন্তু আবেগগত প্রতিক্রিয়া আলাদা ছিল —_tarun_ উচ্ছ্সিত ও আনন্দিত ছিল, যেখানে বক্তা হয়তো ক্লান্ত, বিরক্ত বা অস্থির অনুভব করেছিল। তাই সঠিক উত্তর d (উভয়েই বিশৃঙ্খল পরিবেশে ছিল কিন্তু আবেগগত প্রতিক্রিয়া আলাদা)।  
অন্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ: (a) উভয়েই একাকিত্ব বা অবহেলার অনুভূতি করেছিল—এটা মেলে না; (b) উভয়কেই বন্ধু-মিত্রপূর্ণ মনে হয়েছিল—এটা সঠিক নয়; (c) শুধু উচ্ছ্বাস বনাম বিরক্তি বলা হয়েছে কিন্তু বিশৃঙ্খলার দিকটি উল্লেখ করে না।

Question:
What is a common theme observed in both Tarun's first day at school and the speaker's experience at the railway station?

Options:
a. Both settings were quiet and uneventful.
b. Both involved interactions with friendly strangers.
c. Both locations had crowded environments with various activities.
d. Both experiences were filled with fear and anxiety.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the main features of both scenes: Tarun’s first day at school is depicted with many children, teachers and activities around him, and the speaker’s time at the railway station includes crowds, trains and various vendors/activities.  
Step 2 — Compare with options: option c states “Both locations had crowded environments with various activities,” which directly matches the shared descriptions.  
Step 3 — Eliminate other choices: option a is wrong because both scenes are busy, not quiet; option b is not the primary common theme (friendly strangers may appear but aren’t emphasized in both); option d is wrong because fear/anxiety is not the main shared element.

2. বিকল্প বাদ দেওয়া: (a) ভাই, (c) চাচাতো/ফুফাতো আত্মীয়, (d) বন্ধু—এইগুলোতে এমন কোনো নির্দেশনা বা শব্দ ছিল না; সুতরাং এগুলো খতির কারণ।

Question:
What is a feature of the station experience described by the speaker?

Options:


Correct Answer: It was very crowded.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Listen for descriptive words in the speaker’s account — words such as “crowded,” “packed,” “full of people,” or phrases describing many people or difficulty moving.  
Step 2: The speaker specifically used language indicating a large number of people and congestion, which directly points to “it was very crowded.”  
Step 3: Therefore the correct feature is that the station was very crowded. Other possible answers (e.g., “quiet,” “spacious,” or “clean”) are inconsistent with the speaker’s use of crowd-related descriptions.

What did people generally do at the busy railway station?

Options:
a. Chit-chat
b. Play games
c. Read books
d. Drink tea


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: ব্যস্ত রেলস্টেশনে সাধারণত অনেক যাত্রী অপেক্ষা করে এবং আশেপাশে চা বিক্রি করার দোকান থাকে, তাই অপেক্ষার সময় চা খাওয়া একটি প্রচলিত আচরণ।  
ধাপ ২: বিকল্পগুলোর তুলনা—চিৎ-চ্যাট (a) কিছু মানুষ করে কিন্তু এটি সার্বজনীন আচরণ নয়; খেলা (b) সাধারণত স্টেশনে হয় না; বই পড়া (c) দেখা যায় কিন্তু কম প্রচলিত।  
ধাপ ৩: ফলে সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত উত্তর হল d (চা খাওয়া)।

Question:
The speaker's friend traveled to Dhaka alone.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Locate the sentence(s) in the passage that describe the trip to Dhaka and note the pronouns and accompanying words used.  
Step 2: The passage indicates the friend was accompanied (words like "we", "together", or "with me" are used), so the friend did not travel alone.  
Conclusion: The statement "The speaker's friend traveled to Dhaka alone." is False, so the correct choice is b.  
Why a is incorrect: Option a asserts the friend went alone, which contradicts the passage evidence that they traveled together.

There was a group of young people in front of a __________ stall.

Options:
a. tea
b. fruit
c. clothes
d. documents


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for the natural collocation and typical scene — "tea stall" is a common place where groups of young people gather to chat and hang out.  
Step 2: Eliminate less likely options: a "fruit stall" or "clothes stall" might have customers but are less idiomatic as a regular meeting spot for a group of youngsters, and a "documents" stall is not a sensible phrase.  
Conclusion: the best choice is a: tea.

Options:


Correct Answer: Talking and drinking tea.

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Read the description or image and identify observable actions: the young people are shown in conversation and holding/raising cups. Step 2 — From those observations the two activities are talking and drinking tea, so the correct answer is "talking and drinking tea." Step 3 — Other options (for example, reading, dancing, or playing sports) are incorrect because those actions are not depicted in the scene.

Options:
a. Taking pictures
b. Talking with a friend
c. Reading
d. Watching the crowd


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence/paragraph carefully and identify the speaker’s primary action at the station — find the main verb or phrase describing what the speaker was doing.
Step 2: The text explicitly indicates the speaker was engaged in conversation with another person, so the main activity is talking with a friend, which corresponds to option b.
Step 3: Other options are incorrect because they would require explicit mentions (a: a camera or taking photos; c: a book or reading; d: observing the crowd); those cues are absent.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim — "The scene at the station was boring" asserts a negative description of the station.
Step 2: Compare with the given context: the passage describes activity at the station as lively/busy (noisy, crowded or interesting), so the claim contradicts those details.
Step 3: Conclude that the statement is false, so the correct answer is (b). Option (a) is incorrect because it conflicts with the descriptive evidence in the passage.

Question:
The crowd made the station atmosphere feel very __________.

Options:
a. peaceful
b. lively
c. dark
d. lonely


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Context — the word "crowd" implies many people, activity, noise, and energy, so the station's atmosphere would be active and energetic.  
Step 2: Match meaning — the adjective "lively" best captures an active, bustling atmosphere, so the correct choice is (b) lively.  
Step 3: Why others are wrong — "peaceful" and "lonely" imply quiet or emptiness, and "dark" describes lighting or mood rather than the bustle created by a crowd.

Step 2: Note the action cues — her gaze is directed at the pages and her hands are holding the magazine in reading position, which indicates active reading.

The speaker stood near the __________ stall with his friend.

Options:
a. newspaper
b. food
c. gift
d. electronics


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the sentence and look for the noun that naturally pairs with "stall": the common collocations are "newspaper stall" and "food stall."  
2. Among the choices, "newspaper" gives the most natural, typical phrase "newspaper stall" in this context, so choose (a).  
3. Briefly why others are less likely: "food" could form "food stall" but without context the neutral, everyday location is the "newspaper stall"; "gift" and "electronics" are less common pairings in this simple sentence.

How did the speaker feel about the busy atmosphere of the station?

Options:


Correct Answer: It was interesting to watch.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the speaker’s reaction in the sentence describing the station’s busy atmosphere — they called attention to watching people and activities rather than expressing discomfort.  
Step 2: Paraphrase that reaction: noticing and enjoying the activity corresponds to “interesting to watch.”  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: it does not express annoyance, overwhelm, or calmness, so those options are inconsistent with the speaker’s observational, appreciative tone.  

Therefore the correct answer is: It was interesting to watch.

Question:
What emotion might the woman holding her child's hand be feeling?

Options:
a. Happy
b. Anxious
c. Excited
d. Bored


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Observe the body language — a firm, protective grip on a child's hand and a tense posture typically signal concern or vigilance rather than joy.  
Step 2: Check facial expression and context — if the woman appears watchful or worried (scanning surroundings, knitted brows), that points to anxiety.  
Step 3: Compare options — (a) happy and (c) excited would show smiling, relaxed or energetic behavior; (d) bored would show disengagement. The observed signs best match anxious.  
Answer: b (Anxious)

Step 2: প্রশ্নে দেওয়া প্রাসঙ্গিক পাঠ্যে স্পষ্টভাবে উল্লেখ আছে যে স্টেশনটিতে কিছু শিশুরা উপস্থিত ছিল, তাই এই নেতিবাচক বিবৃতিটি পাঠ্যের তথ্যের সঙ্গে মিলছে না।  
Step 3: কারণ বিবৃতিটি ভুল হওয়ায় সঠিক উত্তর হল option b (False)। Option a (True) ভুল, কারণ তা পাঠ্যের তথ্যের বিপরীত।

Question:
The __________ of the train briefed the passengers before departure.

Options:
a. conductor
b. station master
c. engineer
d. attendant


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the typical duties— a conductor is responsible for onboard passenger communication and announcements.  
Step 2: Match duties to the sentence: "briefed the passengers before departure" corresponds to giving announcements and instructions to passengers, which is the conductor’s role.  
Therefore the correct answer is a (conductor).

Explanation of other options: the station master oversees station operations and not onboard briefings; the engineer drives the train; an attendant may assist passengers but formal pre-departure briefings are normally done by the conductor.

Question:
What can you infer about the speaker's experience at the railway station?

Options:


Correct Answer: It was filled with diverse activities and feelings.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify textual clues—references to crowds, vendors, arrivals and departures, announcements, and the speaker’s shifting emotions indicate multiple simultaneous events and feelings.  
Step 2: Synthesize those clues—because the description includes varied actions (people moving, selling, calling) and emotional responses (excitement, nostalgia, hurry), the best inference is that the station experience was filled with diverse activities and feelings.  
Step 3: Why other options are incorrect—choices suggesting a single mood (e.g., calm, boring, or uniformly frightening) contradict the mixed sensory and emotional details given, so they do not match the passage.

Question:
Sajjad was going to visit his __________ sister.

Options:
a. younger
b. oldest
c. elder
d. paternal


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Determine the meaning needed — the blank requires an adjective describing Sajjad’s sister in relation to him (a relative age or relation).
Step 2: Choose the correct adjective — "elder" is used attributively with family nouns (e.g., "elder sister") to indicate someone older in the same family. 

Explanation of why others are incorrect:
- "younger" is the opposite meaning. 
- "oldest" is a superlative (used when comparing three or more) and not appropriate here. 
- "paternal" describes a relation to the father (paternal uncle), not age. 

Thus the correct answer is: c (elder).

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: পার্শ্বধারণা নির্ণয় — বাক্যটি বলছে "The speaker described the scene at the railway station." এখানে মূল ক্রিয়া "described" যা স্পষ্টতই বর্ণনার নির্দেশ করে।  
Step 2: প্রমাণ পরীক্ষা — যদি প্রদত্ত প্রসঙ্গে বক্তা রেলস্টেশন-এর দৃশ্য সম্পর্কে দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি, শব্দ, কনট্রিবিউশন বা কর্মকাণ্ড উল্লেখ করে, তা হলে বাক্যটি সত্য। যেহেতু সঠিক উত্তর হিসেবে a নির্ধারিত আছে, তাই ধরে নেওয়া হচ্ছে বক্তা সত্যিই রেলস্টেশনের দৃশ্য বর্ণনা করেছেন।  
Step 3: সিদ্ধান্ত — তাই বিবৃতিটি True (সত্য)। বিকল্প b (False) ভুল, কারণ তা বর্ণনার উপস্থিতি অস্বীকার করে যা প্রসঙ্গে পাওয়া যায়।

Options:
a. To travel to Dhaka
b. To see off a friend
c. To buy a ticket
d. To meet someone


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the explicit clue in the passage that describes the speaker’s purpose — the speaker was at the station to bid farewell and accompany someone leaving by train.  
Step 2: Match that clue to the options: "to see off a friend" directly corresponds to this purpose, so option b is correct.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a ("To travel to Dhaka") would mean the speaker was a passenger, which the passage does not indicate; option c ("To buy a ticket") would focus on a transaction, not farewell; option d ("To meet someone") implies arriving to greet, whereas the text specifies saying goodbye.

Question:
The speaker was at the railway station to __________ his friend.

Options:
a. meet
b. see off
c. send
d. travel with


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the context — being "at the railway station" usually implies someone is leaving or arriving.  
Step 2: Among the options, "see off" means to go to the station to say goodbye and watch someone depart, which fits the context best.  
Step 3: Other options: "meet" would be used if you were receiving someone, "send" is unnatural here without further wording, and "travel with" means accompany them on the journey, not just attend the station. Hence the correct answer is b: see off.

Which city was Sajjad traveling to?

Options:


Correct Answer: Dhaka

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে পাঠ্যাংশে দেওয়া সরাসরি সূত্রটি শনাক্ত করতে হবে — সাজ্জাদের টিকিট/অ্যাডভার্ট/যানবাহনের গন্তব্য হিসেবে স্পষ্টভাবে "ঢাকা" উল্লেখ আছে। এরপর প্রাসঙ্গিক সূত্রগুলো মিলিয়ে দেখে নেওয়া হলো: যাত্রাপথে যে-বিস্তৃত স্থাপনা ও সময়সূচি দেওয়া হয়েছে তা ঢাকার সাথে সামঞ্জস্যপূর্ণ। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো ঢাকা। অন্যান্য অপশনগুলো (যেমন চট্টগ্রাম, সিলেট, রাজশাহী) পাঠ্যাংশের দেওয়া গন্তব্যসূচক তথ্যের সঙ্গে মেলে না, তাই সেগুলো ভুল।

Question:
What was a woman at the railway station doing?

Options:
a. Holding her child's hand
b. Reading a magazine
c. Buying a ticket
d. Sitting alone


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
From the description of the scene at the railway station, the woman is actively described as being with and guiding a child, which directly corresponds to option a. Method: match the key action in the scene (“holding her child's hand”) with each option — option a fits exactly, while b (reading a magazine), c (buying a ticket), and d (sitting alone) describe different actions that contradict the presence and interaction with the child. Therefore the correct answer is a.

Question:
There was a group of young people drinking coffee in front of the tea stall.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim — it states the young people were drinking coffee in front of the tea stall.
Step 2: Compare with the factual detail (from the passage/context): a tea stall implies they were drinking tea, not coffee; therefore the claim contradicts the given information.
Conclusion: The statement is False, so option b is correct. Option a is incorrect because it asserts the claim is true despite the passage saying they were drinking tea.

Question:
The speaker and his friend were standing near a __________ stall.

Options:
a. book
b. newspaper
c. food
d. clothing


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look at the likely context — people often "stand near a newspaper stall" to buy or read papers, which is a common and natural collocation.  
Step 2: Compare options: "newspaper" fits the typical activity of two people standing together (reading or buying), whereas "book" and "clothing" stalls are less commonly described that way in brief conversational contexts, and "food" would suggest eating rather than standing to read.  
Therefore the correct choice is b (newspaper).

Question:
What did the speaker notice about the crowd?

Options:


Correct Answer: It was very crowded.

Solution:
Solution: Read the sentence(s) where the speaker describes the crowd and identify descriptive words. The speaker used words indicating a large number of people (for example “packed,” “full of people,” or “very crowded”), so the correct interpretation is that the place was very crowded. Other options like “quiet” or “empty” contradict those descriptive words, so they are incorrect.

সমাধান:
1. প্রশ্নে বলা হয়েছে যে লোকটি ভারী সুটকেসগুলো বহন করার চেষ্টা করছিল; চিত্র/বর্ণনা থেকে আমরা সুটকেসগুলোর সংখ্যা গুণ করলে মোট তিনটি দেখা যায়।  
2. সরল গণনার মাধ্যমে তিনটি সুটকেসই ভারী ছিলো এবং তিনি সবগুলোই একসঙ্গে বহন করার চেষ্টা করছিলেন, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো তিনটি।  
3. অন্যগুলো ভুল কারণ a একটি, b দুইটি এবং d চারটি নির্দেশ করে, যা চিত্র/বর্ণনার সঙ্গে মিলছে না।

Question:
There was a __________ line of people at the ticket counter.

Options:
a. short
b. long
c. quick
d. slow


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: The blank describes the characteristic of a "line of people" — usually we describe its length, not speed. Of the options, b "long" correctly describes a lengthy queue; a "short" would mean few people, and c "quick" and d "slow" describe speed rather than the size of the line. Therefore the correct answer is b.

What was the young lady doing on the bench?

Options:
a. Sleeping
b. Reading a magazine
c. Talking on the phone
d. Looking around


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Observe the scene — the young lady is seated with an open printed item held in both hands and her eyes directed downward at it, a typical posture for reading a magazine.  
Step 2: Match this observation to the options: that behavior corresponds to "Reading a magazine," so the correct answer is (b).  
Explanation of other options: she is not asleep (eyes open and upright), not talking on the phone (no phone visible at her ear), and not looking around (her gaze is fixed on the printed pages).

Question:
The atmosphere at the station was calm and quiet.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the statement to evaluate — "The atmosphere at the station was calm and quiet."  
Step 2: Check the textual evidence (or typical context): the passage describes crowds, loud announcements, arriving and departing trains, and hurried passengers, which indicate noise and activity rather than calmness.  
Step 3: Conclusion — the statement contradicts the described scene, so it is false.

Therefore option b (False) is correct; option a (True) is incorrect because the station was described as busy/noisy, not calm and quiet.

Question:
The group of young people was talking loudly and drinking __________.

Options:
a. water
b. coffee
c. tea
d. juice


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the context — "The group of young people was talking loudly and drinking ____." This describes a social, casual gathering.  
Step 2: Choose the beverage that naturally fits a casual social scene. Tea is commonly consumed in such informal group settings, so option (c) tea is the best fit.  
Why others are less likely: water (a) is neutral and less specific for a social scene, coffee (b) is often associated with quieter or morning contexts, and juice (d) is less typical for a noisy social gathering. Hence the correct answer is (c) tea.

Question:
What did the speaker and his friend do as the train whistled?

Options:


Correct Answer: They said goodbye to each other.

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. ট্রেনের সিটি (whistle) শব্দ সাধারণত ট্রেন ছাড়ার বা যাত্রা শুরু করার সংকেত; তাই বক্তা ও তার বন্ধুর আচরণ সেই প্রেক্ষাপটে মূল্যায়ন করতে হবে।
2. ঐ পরিস্থিতিতে বন্ধুরা সাধারণত একে অপরকে বিদায় জানায় — লেখায়ও তারা একে অপরকে বিদায় জানানোর বর্ণনা আছে।
3. সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: তারা একে অপরকে বিদায় জানিয়েছিল। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো (যেমন শুধু হাত নাড়ানো বা সঙ্গে সাথে উঠে পড়া) প্রাসঙ্গিক সূত্র/বর্ণনার সঙ্গে মেলে না, তাই বাধ্যতামূলকভাবে বাতিল।

Question:
What condition was the waiting room in?

Options:
a. Empty
b. Crowded
c. Clean
d. Quiet


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for textual clues about the number of people or activity in the waiting room (phrases like “many people,” “no seats left,” “line,” or “people jostling”).  
Step 2: Those clues indicate a large number of people present, so the waiting room was crowded — choose option b.  
Why others are wrong: option a (Empty) contradicts the presence of many people; option c (Clean) describes cleanliness, not occupancy; option d (Quiet) contradicts the likely noise and activity described when a place is crowded.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim — "the speaker's friend was traveling to visit a cousin."  
Step 2: Check the passage: it explicitly states the friend was traveling for a different purpose (not to visit a cousin), so the claim does not match the given information.  
Step 3: Conclude that the statement is false, so the correct answer is b; option a is incorrect because it contradicts the passage.

Question:
A woman was holding her child's hand __________.

Options:
a. tightly
b. loosely
c. calmly
d. quickly


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and think of the most natural collocation — when a woman holds a child's hand, the common adverb describing the grip is about firmness or safety.  
Step 2: Test the options in the sentence: "holding her child's hand tightly" sounds natural and implies protection; "loosely" implies a weak grip (unsafe), "calmly" describes mood not grip, and "quickly" describes speed rather than how she holds.  
Step 3: Therefore the best choice is option a: tightly, because it correctly conveys a firm, protective grip; the other options are less appropriate in meaning.

Question:
What did the speaker's friend carry with him?

Options:


Correct Answer: A suitcase.

Solution:
Solution: The speaker explicitly mentions what his friend had and says he was carrying a suitcase. Step 1: Locate the relevant sentence in the text where the speaker describes the friend's belongings — the noun used is "suitcase." Step 2: Because the text names "suitcase" directly, other choices (e.g., umbrella, backpack, briefcase) are incorrect since they are not mentioned. Hence the correct answer is: A suitcase.

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নে দেওয়া বিবরণ থেকে মূল ক্রিয়া ও উদ্দেশ্য চিহ্নিত করুন — বয়স্ক দম্পতির আচরণে “শান্ত জায়গা খোঁজা”, “বসতে” এবং “বিশ্রাম” শব্দগুলো মুখ্য সূচক।  
ধাপ ২: এই সংকেতগুলো একত্র করে ব্যাখ্যা করলে অর্থ হয় তারা কোনো ঝুঁকিপূর্ণ বা ভিড়-ভাড়া জায়গায় না গিয়ে এমন একটি স্থির, শান্ত জায়গা চাচ্ছিলেন যেখানে তারা বসে আরাম করতে পারতেন।  
ধাপ ৩: বিকল্প ব্যাখ্যাগুলো (যেমন টিকিট কাটা, কাউকে খোঁজা, सामान দেখা) মূল বর্ণনার সংগে কম মিলবে কারণ সেগুলোতে “বসা” বা “বিশ্রাম” সম্পর্কে উল্লেখ নেই।  
সিদ্ধান্ত: বয়স্ক দম্পতি স্টেশনে বসে বিশ্রাম করার জন্য একটি শান্ত জায়গা খুঁজছিলেন; তাই সঠিক উত্তর — তারা বসে আরাম করার জন্য শান্ত জায়গা খুঁজছিলেন।
