Question:
Which punctuation mark indicates a question?

Options:
a. Exclamation mark
b. Comma
c. Question mark
d. Full stop


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Identify the function of each punctuation: an exclamation mark expresses strong feeling, a comma separates clauses or items, and a full stop ends a statement. Step 2 — A question is indicated by a question mark, placed at the end of an interrogative sentence. Therefore the correct choice is option (c) — Question mark; the other options are incorrect because they serve different purposes.

Question:
What was Toad’s reaction when he first saw the green plants?

Options:


Correct Answer: Excitement or joy

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Locate the part of the text describing Toad’s immediate response when he first sees the green plants.  
Step 2: Note the words and actions used — for example words indicating delight (smiling, exclaiming, heart leaping, jumping up) or descriptions of joyful behaviour. These cues show an emotional positive reaction rather than fear or indifference.  
Conclusion: Therefore Toad’s reaction was one of excitement or joy. Other options like fear, sadness, or indifference are incorrect because the text uses positive, energetic language that signals pleasure rather than negative or neutral feelings.

Question:
Toad believed the seeds would grow if he __________ to them.

Options:
a. Ignored
b. Sang
c. Shouted
d. Screamed


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution: The blank needs a verb that makes sense with "to them" and matches the idea that Toad actively did something believing it would help seeds grow.

Step 1: Test each option in the sentence.
- "Ignored" implies inaction, which contradicts the idea of doing something to make seeds grow.
- "Sang" is grammatical ("sang to them") and possible, but less likely in ordinary contexts without further context.
- "Shouted" ("shouted to them") is natural and fits the notion of Toad doing a loud, intentional action to encourage growth.
- "Screamed" suggests fear or pain, so it’s less appropriate here.

Step 2: Choose the best fit.
Therefore the correct answer is c: Shouted, because it best matches the intended meaning and tone of the sentence.

Question:
The seeds thrived without any water or sunlight.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the statement — "thrived" means the seeds grew and developed, not just remained dormant.  
Step 2: Biological fact — for seeds to germinate and grow they need water (to activate metabolism) and a source of energy (usually sunlight for photosynthesis once leaves form, or initial stored nutrients only for a short period). Without any water or sunlight a seed may remain dormant or eventually die, but it cannot thrive.  
Conclusion: The statement is false, so the correct answer is (b) False. Option (a) True is incorrect because growth requires at least water and an energy source.

Question:
What does Toad’s behavior with the seeds represent?

Options:
a. Impatience
b. Joy
c. Laziness
d. Indifference


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the action — Toad handles the seeds in a way that seeks immediate outcome (e.g., fiddling with/eating them or expecting instant growth).
Step 2: Interpret the motive — this behavior shows restlessness and a desire for quick results, which aligns with impatience.
Step 3: Eliminate other options — (b) Joy would show celebration or pleasure, (c) Laziness would show refusal to act, and (d) Indifference would show lack of concern; none match the eager, hasty behavior.
Therefore the correct answer is (a) Impatience.

Question:
What kind of seeds did Toad plant?

Options:


Correct Answer: Flower seeds

Solution:
Solution: Read the passage for the clue about what grew from the seeds Toad planted — it specifically says the seeds produced blooms or flowers. From that direct evidence we conclude Toad planted flower seeds. Other options (e.g., vegetable, tree, or grass seeds) are incorrect because they would not be described as producing flowers in the context given.

The story about Toad shows that __________ can lead to success.

Options:
a. Anger
b. Hard work
c. Luck

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Step 1: The story of the Toad emphasizes persistence, repeated effort, and learning from mistakes until he succeeds. Step 2: These qualities correspond to "Hard work", so the correct choice is (b). Step 3: The other options are incorrect because the story does not highlight anger, luck, or magic as the causes of success.

Question:
All the seeds grew immediately after being planted.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the statement as a universal claim — "All the seeds grew immediately" means every seed grew right away.  
Step 2: To disprove a universal claim it suffices to find one counterexample: a seed that did not grow immediately (seeds often require time to germinate or may be non-viable).  
Step 3: Since in reality some seeds take days to germinate or fail to grow under given conditions, the universal statement is false.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: False (option a is incorrect because the word "all" is not supported by a single counterexample).

Question:
How did Toad eventually feel about the effort he put into the garden?

Options:
a. Regretful
b. Happy
c. Annoyed
d. Indifferent


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the passage context — Toad put a lot of effort into planting and caring for the garden and later observed the results (beautiful flowers, satisfied visitors, or personal pride).  
Step 2: Interpret Toad’s reaction — his satisfaction with the garden’s success shows a positive emotional response, i.e., he felt happy about his effort.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options — he was not regretful (would imply he wished he hadn’t worked), not annoyed (would imply frustration), and not indifferent (would imply no emotional response).  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) Happy.

Question:
What lesson does the story convey about patience?

Options:


Correct Answer: Good things take time and require patience.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify key events in the story where a character waits, perseveres, or steadily works toward a goal and then receives a positive outcome.  
Step 2: Infer the general message from those events: the rewards come after sustained effort or waiting, not instantly.  
Step 3: Conclude that the lesson is that good things take time and require patience.  

Explanation of why other choices would be incorrect: any option suggesting immediate results, rushing, or abandoning effort contradicts the story’s examples showing that careful waiting or persistent effort produces the positive outcome.

Question:
Frog advised Toad to let the __________ shine on the seeds.

Options:
a. Rain
b. Sun
c. Night
d. Cold


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Frog advised letting the sun shine on the seeds because seeds need light and warmth to germinate and grow. Step 1: identify the factor that provides both heat and light — the sun. Step 2: choose the option that matches this need — "Sun" is correct. Other options are incorrect because rain gives water but not heat/light, night provides neither, and cold inhibits germination.

Question:
Frog had a garden that required no work.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim — "Frog had a garden that required no work" asserts that the garden needed zero maintenance.
Step 2: Evaluate the statement using common sense/context — gardens normally require planting, watering, weeding or upkeep; unless the passage explicitly states otherwise, the claim is unlikely to be true.
Step 3: Conclude — the statement is false, so the correct choice is b (False). 

Explanation: Option a (True) is incorrect because it contradicts the usual requirement that gardens need work and there is no evidence provided that this garden truly required no work.

What did Toad do on the first day when waiting for seeds?

Options:
a. Watered them
b. Shouted
c. Read to them
d. Planted them


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution: The passage states that when Toad waited for the seeds, on the first day he sat with them and read aloud, so his action was reading to the seeds. This directly matches option c (Read to them). Options a (Watered them) and d (Planted them) describe different gardening actions not described as his first-day activity, and option b (Shouted) contradicts the calm behavior of reading, so they are incorrect.

Options:


Correct Answer: Joy

Solution:
Solution: When Toad saw the plants growing, the passage describes his reaction as a happy, delighted feeling — in other words, joy. Method: identify the sentence that reports Toad’s emotion on seeing the plants; the wording indicates pleasure and satisfaction, not any negative emotion. Other options like sadness, anger, or fear contradict the positive description, so the correct answer is Joy.

Question:
The hard work was worth it because __________ grew.

Options:
a. Weeds
b. Animals
c. Plants
d. Insects


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence "The hard work was worth it because __________ grew." It implies a positive, intended result of effort (something cultivated or cared for).
Step 2: Choose the option that best matches an intended, positive growth: "plants" is the natural result of gardening or farming work, so option (c) is correct.
Explanation of other options: "weeds" are usually unwanted, so one would not normally say hard work was worth it because weeds grew; "animals" and "insects" are less likely to be the expected, intentional outcome of hard work in this context.

What does Frog suggest Toad should do with the seeds?

Options:
a. Yell at them
b. Leave them alone
c. Water them constantly
d. Plant them in a box


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the dialogue or context carefully — Frog tells Toad how to treat the seeds and emphasizes patience.  
Step 2: Eliminate wrong choices: (a) yelling at them is not sensible or suggested; (c) watering them constantly would drown the seeds; (d) planting them in a box is not what Frog recommends in the dialogue.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct suggestion from Frog is option b: Leave them alone.

Options:

Solution:

The text explicitly says he waited "a few days" for them to grow, so that phrase is the direct evidence. Therefore the correct answer is "A few days." Other choices (for example "a few hours," "a week," or "never") are incorrect because they contradict the stated timeline in the passage.

An exclamation mark is used to express __________.

Options:
a. Questions
b. Excitement
c. Pause
d. End of a sentence


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the function of the exclamation mark (!): it is primarily used to show strong emotion, surprise, emphasis, or excitement.  
Step 2: Compare with the options: a (questions) is the role of a question mark (?), c (pause) is shown by commas or ellipses, and d (end of a sentence) is generally a period—while an exclamation mark can end a sentence, its main purpose is to express excitement.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: Excitement.

Quotation marks are used to show that someone is speaking.

Options:

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Quotation marks are punctuation marks used to enclose the exact words spoken by a person or to quote written text.  
Step 2: When we want to show someone is speaking, we place their spoken words inside quotation marks (for example: "I am coming.").  
Therefore the statement is True, so the correct choice is a. Option b is incorrect because it denies the primary function of quotation marks to indicate direct speech.

Question:
What does a comma indicate in a sentence?

Options:
a. End of a question
b. Long pause
c. Short pause
d. Excitement


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: A comma commonly marks a short pause within a sentence, used to separate words, phrases, or clauses so the sentence reads clearly.  
Step 2: For example, commas separate items in a list, set off introductory phrases, or join independent clauses with a conjunction—these uses create brief pauses rather than stops.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is (c) Short pause. Options (a) End of a question, (b) Long pause, and (d) Excitement are incorrect because questions end with a question mark, long pauses or full stops use periods/semicolons/dashes, and excitement is shown by an exclamation mark.

Options:


Correct Answer: Spring

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify textual clues in the story — mentions of flowers and buds opening, fresh green leaves, mild weather, and birds returning or singing.  
Step 2: Match those clues to seasonal characteristics: blooming plants, new growth, and warmer-but-not-hot conditions are typical of spring.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options: summer would describe hot weather, autumn would emphasize falling leaves and harvest, and winter would mention cold, bare trees, or snow.  
Therefore the correct answer is Spring.

Frog told Toad that the seeds were __________ to grow.

Options:
a. Happy
b. Afraid
c. Hungry

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The sentence "Frog told Toad that the seeds were __________ to grow." requires an adjective that can logically modify "to grow." "Afraid to grow" personifies the seeds and makes sense (seeds might be reluctant or inhibited from sprouting), so option b is correct. Options a (happy), c (hungry) and d (sick) do not naturally fit the phrase "to grow" in this context, so they are incorrect.

Step 1: Recall the story detail — Toad tried to encourage the seeds by reading to them.  
Step 2: This matches option (c) “He read them stories,” so that is the correct answer.  
Step 3: The other options are incorrect because watering constantly (a) and singing songs (d) are not described in the story, and shouting at them (b) would be unhelpful and is not mentioned.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify punctuation marks that can terminate a sentence — period (full stop), question mark, and exclamation mark.  
Step 2: For ordinary declarative sentences, the most commonly used end mark is the full stop.  
Explanation: A comma does not end a sentence (it separates clauses), a question mark ends only interrogative sentences, and an exclamation mark is used for strong emotion or emphasis but is less common overall.

Question:
Seeds grow immediately after being planted.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Seeds are usually dormant when planted; they require suitable conditions (water, oxygen, and appropriate temperature) to begin germination.  
Step 2: Germination is a process that takes time — first the seed absorbs water (imbibition), metabolic activity resumes, and then the radicle and shoot emerge after hours to days.  
Therefore the statement is False: seeds do not grow immediately after planting. Option (a) True is incorrect because growth begins only after the seed completes the germination steps under favorable conditions.

Options:
a. The sun

c. The water
d. Frog's advice


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Toad’s belief from the story — Toad thought something about the environment was preventing the seeds from sprouting.  
Step 2: Reasoning — Toad blamed the lack of light, i.e., the darkness, for the seeds not growing, so he believed the dark was the cause.  
Step 3: Check other options — the sun and water would normally help growth (so they wouldn’t be blamed), and Frog’s advice is an action, not a direct cause, so those are incorrect.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) The dark.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence "Toad wanted to have his own ________" and note that we need a noun that logically completes the desire of a toad.  
Step 2: From the options, "Garden" fits best — many stories about a toad (or Toad of Toad Hall) describe him wanting his own garden or patch of land.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is option (b) Garden. Other options (Dog, Car, House) are less likely or not contextually appropriate for a toad in typical narratives.

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the statement's claim — it asserts that the character "Toad" performed the action "sang songs to his seeds."  
Step 2: Check the text/context: the sentence explicitly says "Toad sang songs to his seeds," so the action is stated as fact in the sentence.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a) True because the sentence itself affirms that Toad sang to his seeds. Option (b) False is incorrect because it contradicts the explicit wording of the sentence.
