Question:
The letter references __________ incidents in Congo.

Options:
a. peaceful
b. political
c. ethnic
d. violent


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
The correct answer is (d) violent. The phrasing indicates the letter mentions harmful, forceful events in Congo, which corresponds to "violent incidents." Options like "peaceful" contradict the described harm, while "political" or "ethnic" describe types or causes of incidents rather than the violent nature explicitly referenced.

Question:
McLuhan believed electronic media would divide the world.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: ระনIdentify the claim — the statement says McLuhan believed electronic media would divide the world.  
Step 2: Recall McLuhan’s core idea — he argued that electronic media create a "global village" by instantly connecting people across distances (famous phrase: "the medium is the message"), so they tend to integrate and interconnect societies rather than divide them.  
Step 3: Conclusion — therefore the statement is false; the correct answer is b.  
Why the other option is incorrect: Option a (True) is wrong because it contradicts McLuhan’s view of electronic media fostering global interconnectedness, not division.

Solution:
Solution: Read the sentence in the passage that states Ashar's age when he moved and the place he moved to — it explicitly says he moved to Singapore when he was eight.

Question:
What is essential for a global citizen according to Ashar?

Options:


Correct Answer: Understanding and appreciating different cultures.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Ashar’s central idea — he emphasizes empathy and cross-cultural awareness as the core qualities of a global citizen.  
Step 2: Compare options: "Understanding and appreciating different cultures" directly matches that emphasis, while alternatives like economic power, technical skills, or national loyalty miss the interpersonal, value-based element Ashar highlights.  
Step 3: Conclude that the correct answer is "Understanding and appreciating different cultures" because it captures the necessary respect, openness, and willingness to learn about others that Ashar describes.

Therefore the correct answer is (a) Clothing; the other options are incorrect because they are explicitly stated as being distributed.

Question:
The letter informs about Ashar's experiences in a __________ school.

Options:
a. community
b. private
c. language
d. foreign


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the clues in the letter that point to the setting — mentions of local children, neighborhood involvement, community activities or volunteers indicate a school run by or for the local community.  
Step 2: Match those clues to the options: that description best fits a "community" school, so option (a) is correct.  

Explanation of why others are incorrect: option (b) "private" would imply paid or independently run with individual ownership (not indicated), option (c) "language" would emphasize language instruction (not mentioned), and option (d) "foreign" would imply an overseas or international setting (also not supported by the letter).

What does Ashar think about different cultures?

Options:


Correct Answer: He thinks they are important to understand.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the statement about Ashar’s view — the passage or question indicates his attitude toward different cultures.  
Step 2: Reasoning — Ashar’s comments emphasize learning about traditions and valuing cultural differences, so the logical conclusion is that he thinks different cultures are important to understand.  
Step 3: Why other choices are wrong — options suggesting he dislikes, fears, or ignores other cultures contradict his expressed desire to learn and value them, so they are incorrect.

Since Congo is not mentioned in Ashar’s journey while Denmark, Singapore, and the US are, the correct answer is (b) Congo.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the final sentence of the text and identify its meaning.

What role does the voluntary organization have in Congo?

Options:
a. Healthcare
b. Education
c. Political stability
d. Military support


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the typical functions of voluntary organizations — they usually provide social services such as schooling, literacy programs, and community education.  
Step 2: In the Congo context, many voluntary organizations and NGOs concentrate on rebuilding and running schools, adult education, and vocational training to improve long-term development.  
Step 3: Therefore the best match is option (b) Education; options (a) Healthcare and (c) Political stability can be secondary activities, and (d) Military support is not a role of voluntary organizations.

What does Uncle Reza hope for Sohan as mentioned in the letter?

Options:


Correct Answer: That he does well in his final exams.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the letter and locate the sentence where Uncle Reza expresses a wish — he explicitly says he hopes Sohan will "do well in his final exams."
Step 2: Interpret that phrase: "do well in his final exams" means Uncle Reza wishes Sohan to perform well and get good results.
Step 3: Conclude that the correct answer is that Uncle Reza hopes Sohan does well in his final exams.
Explanation why other options are incorrect: any other choices (e.g., wishing a safe journey, better health, or a new job) are not mentioned in the letter, so they do not match the explicit hope expressed by Uncle Reza.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:  
Step 1: প্রশ্নে বলা হয়েছে আসহার কোনভাবে গ্লোবালাইজেশনকে উল্লেখ করেছেন—গ্লোবালাইজেশন সাধারণত দেশের সীমানা ছাড়িয়ে মানুষের দায়িত্ব, পরিচয় ও অংশগ্রহণের বিস্তার বোঝায়।  
Step 2: বিকল্পগুলোর মধ্যে b "Global Citizen" সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত, কারণ এটি ব্যক্তিকে বিশ্বব্যাপী দায়িত্বশীল ও আন্তঃসংযুক্ত নাগরিক হিসেবে দেখায়—ঠিকই গ্লোবালাইজেশনের ধারণা।  
Step 3: অন্যগুলো ভুল কেন: "Cultural Awareness" (a) কেবল সাংস্কৃতিক সচেতনতার দিকে ইঙ্গিত করে, "Global Village" (c) একটি রূপক, আর "World Peace" (d) গ্লোবালাইজেশনের একটি সম্ভাব্য লক্ষ্য তবে সরাসরি একই অর্থ নয়।  
অতএব সঠিক উত্তর: b (Global Citizen).

Step 2: Therefore the correct choice is (a) Ashar.  
Step 3: The other options are incorrect because the text gives no indication that Uncle Reza, Army Officers, or School Friends asked Sohan to write the five questions.

For which mission is the Bangladesh Army currently in Congo?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the key phrase in the question — Bangladesh Army’s deployment in Congo — which implies an international military role rather than a domestic one.
Step 2: Recall that the deployment is described as a peacekeeping-style mission; among the given choices, the option "A US Peacekeeping Mission" matches that description.
Step 3: Eliminate other choices (for example, a combat operation, a training exercise, or a purely humanitarian mission) because they do not fit the characterization “in Congo” as an international peacekeeping deployment.
Conclusion: Therefore the correct answer is "A US Peacekeeping Mission."

Solution:

Step 2: Such clues indicate an ethnic-based dispute rather than one over economics, technology, or general social issues.  
Therefore the correct answer is b (Ethnic). Options a (social) is too broad, c (economic) would focus on resources or money, and d (technological) would involve tech-related causes—none match the identity-based cues.

People in Congo receive __________ from the Army.

Options:
a. weapons
b. education
c. support
d. food


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and identify the most natural noun that an army typically provides to civilians in a crisis: food, weapons, education, or support.  
Step 2: Choose the option that fits common humanitarian actions by armed forces—providing relief supplies. That corresponds to option (d) food.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out the others: weapons (a) are usually not given to civilians by an army, education (b) is provided by schools/government over time rather than directly by the army, and support (c) is vague; food is the specific, concrete item often distributed.  

Therefore the correct answer is (d) food.

The text discusses the role of electronic media in creating a __________ village.

Options:
a. local
b. global
c. physical
d. virtual


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the well-known phrase by Marshall McLuhan that electronic media — especially electronic communications — compress space and time and make the world feel like a single community called a "global village."  
Step 2: Fit that concept into the sentence: the electronic media creates a "global" village, so the correct choice is (b) global.  
Step 3: Why other options are wrong: "local" is the opposite effect, "physical" is incorrect because the phrase is metaphorical about connectedness rather than physicality, and "virtual" is related but not the established term McLuhan used.

Step 3: Conclude the correct answer: he takes care of children’s education in a community school. Other options (for example, providing medical care or doing business) are incorrect because the passage specifically describes educational work.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Step 1: Identify the concept asked — the term for cultural and social interconnectedness described by Marshall McLuhan.

Step 3: Choose the matching option: c (Global Village).  

Why others are incorrect: a (Global Economy) refers specifically to economic interdependence, b (Global Citizenship) refers to a civic/identity stance, and d (Global Awareness) is a general consciousness rather than McLuhan’s coined term.

Step 2: That phrase implies a global scope, so the best choice is (a) world.

Step 2: Match this to the choices: option c ("He enjoys learning about them") directly restates that positive, curious attitude.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a ("He dislikes it") contradicts the liking; option b ("He finds it challenging") implies struggle rather than enjoyment; option d ("He is indifferent") implies lack of interest.

Options:


Correct Answer: Maintaining peace, distributing food, water, and medicine.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the mission context: The Bangladesh Army serves as part of the UN peacekeeping contingent in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO), so their roles are primarily peacekeeping and humanitarian rather than unilateral military conquest.
Step 2 — List the activities: They maintain peace and security by patrolling and protecting civilians, and provide humanitarian assistance such as distributing food, clean water, and medicine to affected populations.
Step 3 — Explain why other options would be incorrect: Options implying purely offensive combat operations or political administration are incorrect because Bangladesh’s deployed troops operate under UN mandates focused on protection, stabilization, and relief rather than conducting independent offensive campaigns.

Step 1: Identify the countries where Ashar attended school — Indonesia, Singapore, and Denmark are listed as places he attended.  
Step 2: Compare the options and find which country is not in that attended list; Congo does not appear among the schools he attended.  
Therefore the correct answer is option d: Congo, because the other three countries are explicitly places where Ashar went to school.

Question:
Ashar believes he belongs to all cultures.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: পড়ার পরে বিবৃতিটি বিশ্লেষণ করলে দেখা যায় যে প্রশ্নে বলা হয়েছে "Ashar believes he belongs to all cultures" — সুতরাং তিনি এমন বিশ্বাস ব্যক্ত করেছেন। তাই বিবৃতিটি সত্য, যা অপশন a দ্বারা প্রকাশ করা হয়েছে। অপশন b (False) ভুল কারণ তা মূল বক্তব্যের বিপরীতে যায়।

Question:
Mr. Global Citizen refers to __________.

Options:
a. Sohan
b. Reza
c. Ashar
d. McLuhan


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রশ্নের প্রসঙ্গে "Mr. Global Citizen" দ্বারা যে ব্যক্তি বোঝানো হয়েছে তিনি হলেন Ashar, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল গ। কারণ প্রদত্ত বিকল্পগুলোর মধ্যে কেবলমাত্র গ—Ashar—ই সেই উপাধির সঙ্গে মিল আছে (প্রশ্নের প্রসঙ্গ বা পাঠ্যে উল্লিখিত)। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ ক Sohan ও খ Reza এই উপাধির সঙ্গে পরিচিত না, এবং ঘ McLuhan হলেন একজন মিডিয়া তত্ত্ববিদ, সুতরাং তিনি "Mr. Global Citizen" নয়।

Question:
What does Ashar say about his work with different people?

Options:


Correct Answer: It's nice to work with different people and learn about them.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Locate the sentence where Ashar talks about his experience working with others and identify the key words (e.g., "nice", "different people", "learn about them").  
Step 2: Paraphrase the meaning: Ashar expresses a positive feeling about collaborating with a variety of people and gaining knowledge about them.  
Step 3: Compare this paraphrase to the choices and select the option that matches exactly: "It's nice to work with different people and learn about them."  
Explanation of distractors: Any option that says he dislikes working with others, prefers working alone, or mentions something unrelated (like pay or status) contradicts Ashar’s expressed positive and learning-focused attitude, so those are incorrect.

Question:
What book did McLuhan write about media?

Options:
a. Understanding Media
b. The Global Village
c. The Medium is the Message
d. Communication in Society


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: Marshall McLuhan's best-known book is [Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man], published in 1964, so the correct answer is option a. The phrase "the medium is the message" is a famous line and chapter from his work, not the book title itself, and "the global village" is a concept he popularized rather than the specific book named in the options; "Communication in Society" is a generic title not associated as his primary work. Therefore option a is correct.

Congo faces no challenges according to the text.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim: “Congo faces no challenges.”  
Step 2: Check the text for evidence — the passage explicitly describes challenges (for example political conflict, economic and infrastructure problems), so the claim contradicts the text.  
Step 3: Conclusion: the claim is false, so the correct answer is b. Option a is incorrect because it denies the clear challenges mentioned in the passage.

Congo is located in __________ Africa.

Options:
a. West
b. East
c. Central
d. North


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Congo (both the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) lies in central Africa, around the middle of the continent near the Equator and the Congo River basin, so the correct choice is Central Africa. West Africa refers to countries along the Atlantic coast farther northwest, East Africa is toward the Indian Ocean and the Great Rift Valley, and North Africa is the Saharan/Mediterranean region—none of which describe Congo’s central location.
