Question:
The poem does not contain any imagery related to a circus.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poem carefully and mark any words or phrases that evoke circus-related images (for example: "big top", "tents", "clowns", "ringmaster", "trapeze", "acrobats", "juggling", "elephants", "brass fanfare", etc.).

Step 2: If at least one such image appears in the poem, the statement "The poem does not contain any imagery related to a circus" is false. Finding even a single circus cue contradicts the universal negative in the statement.

Step 3: Since the correct answer is given as b (False), we conclude that the poem does contain circus imagery; therefore option a (True) is incorrect because it asserts no circus imagery exists.

Step 2: Compare each option with that list: a (Elephants) — mentioned; b (Circus) — mentioned; d (Poems) — mentioned.
Step 3: c (Tigers) is not found in the poem, so it is the correct answer.

Question:
The poem encourages individual interpretation of words.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution: Read the poem and note whether its diction and images are open-ended rather than prescriptive. Step 1: Identify words and metaphors that suggest multiple meanings or invite reflection (ambiguous imagery, metaphors without single fixed referent). Step 2: Check for authorial cues that encourage the reader’s personal response (phrases implying “you may see” or lack of a definitive explanation). Since the poem uses such open, interpretive language, the correct choice is True. Option False is incorrect because it would require the poem to fix a single, authoritative meaning, which contradicts the observed openness.

Question:
Students learn about intonation through the poem and from __________.

Options:
a. Games
b. Stories
c. Movies
d. Songs


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what "intonation" is — the rise and fall of the voice in spoken language, often practiced in reading and speaking activities.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: poems and stories are both spoken texts used in classrooms to model and practice intonation. Among the choices, b Stories best completes the sentence because teachers use stories to demonstrate narrative pitch, stress, and sentence intonation.  
Step 3: Why others are less suitable: games (a) may practice language broadly but not specifically intonation patterns; movies (c) and songs (d) do include intonation, but pedagogically poems and stories are the common paired materials for teaching intonation.  
Answer: (b) Stories

Question:
What are students supposed to create with the vocabulary words?

Options:


Correct Answer: Sentences.

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the prompt: "with the vocabulary words" asks what students should produce using those words.  
2. Reasoning: the usual classroom task to show understanding of vocabulary is to use each word in context, which means forming sentences that demonstrate meaning and correct usage.  
3. Conclusion: therefore students are supposed to create sentences.  
4. Briefly why other options would be less correct: a list or definitions only repeats meanings without context, and a full story is more than needed to show individual word usage.

Question:
Which word refers to the long nose of an elephant?

Options:
a. Tail
b. Leg
c. Trunk
d. Ear


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the anatomical feature described — the long, flexible nose of an elephant used for breathing, grasping, and drinking.  
Step 2: Compare the options: Tail is at the rear, Leg is a limb for walking, Ear is for hearing, and Trunk is the long, flexible nose.  
Therefore the correct answer is (c) Trunk, because that is the specific term for an elephant’s long nose.

Question:
Students will recite the poem only individually.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement "Students will recite the poem only individually" — this asserts that recitation must be individual and excludes any group or choral recitation.  
Step 2: Ask whether that exclusivity is necessarily true; since the statement is absolute ("only"), it is false if group or paired recitation is allowed or possible.  
Conclusion: The correct answer is b (False). Option a (True) is incorrect because the original sentence makes an absolute claim that need not hold in all contexts.

To understand the poem, students are encouraged to __________ it.

Options:
a. Ignore
b. Forget
c. Read
d. Skip


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The goal is "to understand the poem", so we look for an action that helps comprehension (e.g., engaging with the text).
Step 2: Evaluate options: "Ignore", "Forget", and "Skip" would prevent understanding, while "Read" directly promotes comprehension.
Therefore the correct choice is c: Read.

Question:
How do elephants show their friendship according to the poem?

Options:


Correct Answer: By holding tails.

Solution:
Solution: Read the line in the poem that describes the elephants' behavior and identify which action expresses friendship. The poem specifically says they walk together "by holding tails," so their linking tails shows closeness and mutual care. Other choices (e.g., trumpeting, bathing, or playing) may be actions elephants do, but the text explicitly presents tail-holding as the sign of friendship, so "By holding tails" is correct.

What does the term 'circus ring' refer to?

Options:
a. Area for fishing
b. A type of music
c. A place for performances
d. A round food


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify common meaning — a "circus ring" is the circular performance area in a circus where acrobats, clowns, and animals perform.  
Step 2: Match to options — this meaning corresponds to option c: "A place for performances."  
Step 3: Reject other options — it is not an area for fishing (a), not a type of music (b), and not a round food (d).  

Therefore the correct answer is c.

Question:
What does the poem depict about elephants' interactions?

Options:


Correct Answer: They walk together by holding tails.

Solution:
Solution: Read the lines of the poem that describe elephants linking or holding each other's tails and moving in a line. Step 1: identify the literal image — the poem mentions tails being held. Step 2: interpret that action — holding tails implies coordinated, single-file walking together behind a leader. Therefore the correct answer is that they walk together by holding tails. Other options like fighting, wandering separately, or singing are incorrect because the poem emphasizes physical connection and following, not conflict or solitary behavior.

Question:
The activity of matching words with pictures is meant to help with __________.

Options:
a. Understanding
b. Drawing
c. Writing
d. Singing


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Matching words with pictures asks the learner to link a visual image to its corresponding word, which builds meaning and reinforces vocabulary.  
Step 2: This process tests and improves comprehension of words and concepts, so the best answer is option a (Understanding).  
Other options are incorrect because matching does not practice producing drawings (b), composing extended writing (c), or musical skills like singing (d).

Question:
What grammatical elements will students recognize through the lesson?

Options:


Correct Answer: Word stress and intonation.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question to find which grammatical elements the lesson targets — the phrase "word stress and intonation" names prosodic features of spoken language.
Step 2: Recognize that these are the elements students would "recognize" through listening and pronunciation activities, because word stress highlights syllable prominence and intonation shows pitch patterns across sentences.
Step 3: Eliminate other possible grammatical categories (e.g., tense, agreement, word order) because those concern morphology or syntax rather than the pronunciation features described.
Conclusion: Therefore the correct answer is "word stress and intonation" since the lesson focuses on prosody and spoken forms rather than purely syntactic or morphological elements.

Options:
a. The lesson's summary
b. The poem

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the verb "recited" — it most commonly refers to saying aloud a memorized piece (especially poems) either individually or in groups.  
Step 2: Match options to that meaning: a) a lesson's summary is usually reviewed or explained, c) a story is narrated, d) vocabulary words are practiced or drilled.  
Step 3: A poem is traditionally recited aloud (by one person or by a group), so the correct choice is b.

Elephants are the only animals mentioned in the poem.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution: Read the poem carefully and make a short list of all creature names that appear.  
Step 1: Scan each line for nouns that are animals and note them.  
Step 2: Count the distinct animal names found — if the list contains only “elephant” (or “elephants”), then the statement is true.  
Since the poem mentions only elephants and no other animals, the correct choice is a (True); option b is incorrect because no other animals are present.

2. যুক্তি: গল্প ও কবিতা পাঠ করলে শিক্ষার্থীরা কাহিনি ও ছন্দ বুঝে এবং সেগুলো উপভোগ করতে পারে; অন্যান্য অপশনগুলো (রং, গণিত, ইতিহাস)‑এর সাথে "understand and enjoy" মিলটা এখানে তুলনামূলকভাবে সীমিত বা ভিন্ন প্রসঙ্গে ব্যবহৃত হয়।

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read each picture carefully and note the object, action, or scene it shows.
2. Scan the poem and underline the words that name those objects or describe those actions — these are the candidate matches.
3. Match each picture to the word from the poem that best describes it, using the poem’s context (line or stanza) to confirm the correct choice.
4. Other options (for example, matching to whole sentences, grammar rules, or rhyme patterns) are incorrect because the pictures depict specific things or actions that correspond directly to individual words in the poem, not to larger textual elements.

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the actions the text encourages — reading, listening and reciting are all forms of engaging with the poem.  
Step 2: The question asks which students should NOT do, so the opposite of engagement is "ignore the poem." Therefore option c is correct.  
Step 3: Options a, b and d are incorrect because they describe active engagement (read, listen, recite), which the text recommends.

Options:

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: To decide whether the poem is primarily educational, first identify its main purpose from tone and content. If the poem emphasizes feelings, imagery, personal reflection, or aesthetic experience rather than giving instructions, facts, or moral lessons intended to teach, then its primary purpose is not educational. Since the poem’s language and devices are evocative and expressive rather than didactic, the statement "The poem is primarily educational" is false. Correct answer: b (False).

Question:
The elephants in the poem symbolize __________.

Options:
a. Strength
b. Loneliness
c. Friendship
d. Fear


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poem’s description of the elephants — their actions, relationships, and emotional tone (e.g., moving together, caring for one another, or showing companionship).  
Step 2: Match that description to the symbolic choices: the repeated emphasis on togetherness and mutual support points to companionship rather than strength, fear, or isolation.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options: strength (a) would focus on power, loneliness (b) contradicts images of togetherness, and fear (d) is not supported by caring behavior.  
Therefore the best answer is (c) Friendship.

Question:
After the activities, students will be able to recognize __________ in sentences.

Options:
a. Emotion
b. Meaning
c. Intonation
d. Grammar


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and the skill named in each option. The phrase "recognize __________ in sentences" most directly refers to a feature of spoken sentences.

Step 2: Intonation is the pattern of pitch, stress and rhythm in spoken sentences that students learn to notice through listening and speaking activities. Therefore option c (Intonation) is the best fit.

Why the others are less suitable: a (Emotion) can be conveyed by intonation but is not the specific linguistic feature named; b (Meaning) is broader and not a single observable sentence feature; d (Grammar) refers to rules and structure rather than the prosodic pattern students "recognize" in spoken sentences. Hence the correct answer is c.

b. False


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poem and identify the central image or action described — the lines explicitly depict elephants forming a line by holding each other’s tails.
Step 2: Note repetition and focus: if the poem repeatedly describes elephants linking tails or emphasizes that action as the main scene, the overall subject is clearly those elephants holding tails.
Step 3: Conclude that the statement is correct because the poem’s primary theme and imagery center on elephants holding tails; therefore option a (True) is correct and option b (False) is incorrect.

Options:
a. Ears

c. Tails
d. Feet


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the poem’s line that describes how elephants walk together; the imagery states they hold each other by their tails.  
Step 2: That literal description identifies option (c) "Tails" as the correct answer.  
Reasoning about other choices: ears, shoulders, and feet are not mentioned in the poem’s line and do not convey the same linked procession image, so (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.

Name one key activity students will do after reading the poem.

Options:


Correct Answer: Recite the poem in groups or pairs.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question carefully — it asks for one key activity students will do after reading the poem, so look for an action that follows reading and reinforces understanding.  
Step 2: The correct activity is to "recite the poem in groups or pairs" because recitation immediately practices pronunciation, rhythm, and comprehension through collaborative oral work.  
Step 3: Other possible activities (for example, writing a summary or answering comprehension questions) are useful but do not match the specific interactive oral practice described by the correct choice, so they are less appropriate here.

What is one meaning of the word 'trunk' as used in the poem?

Options:
a. A part of a car
b. The long nose of an elephant
c. A tree body
d. A suitcase


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the surrounding lines in the poem to see what image or action the word "trunk" is associated with (e.g., references to an elephant, smelling, spraying water, or grabbing).
Step 2: Match that context to the possible meanings: a car part, an elephant’s long nose, a tree’s body, or a suitcase.
Because the poem’s context points to an elephant and actions/images linked to an elephant’s nose, the correct meaning is the elephant’s long nose — option b. 
Explanation of other options: a, c, and d are other dictionary meanings of "trunk" (car compartment, tree trunk, suitcase) but they don’t fit the poem’s elephant-related context.

Step 2: Confirm that such entries exist — the text explicitly provides definitions or brief explanations for several vocabulary items from the poem.  
Therefore the statement is true, so the correct choice is a (True). Option b (False) is incorrect because it denies the presence of those definitions despite their explicit appearance in the text.

Question:
A _______ is a round area where performances can take place.

Options:
a. Circle
b. Ring
c. Stage
d. Space


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
A "ring" specifically refers to a circular performance area, especially in contexts like a circus ring or wrestling ring, so the correct answer is b. 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the meaning: a "ring" commonly denotes a round or circular space designated for performances.  
2. Check other options: "circle" is only the geometric shape (not specifically a performance area), "stage" is a raised platform (not necessarily round), and "space" is a general term.  
3. Therefore the best match for "a round area where performances can take place" is "ring" (option b).

What should students do with the poem after reading it?

Options:


Correct Answer: Recite it in groups, pairs, and individually.

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the poem carefully once to grasp its meaning, rhythm and difficult words.  
2. Practice reciting it aloud in a group so students learn pronunciation, rhythm and expressive reading from peers.  
3. Then recite in pairs to give and receive feedback, and finally recite individually to build confidence and assess each student’s fluency.  

Reasoning: Reciting in groups, pairs, and individually combines collaborative learning, targeted practice and individual assessment, so the correct choice is to recite the poem in groups, pairs and individually. Other options (e.g., only silent reading or only memorizing alone) do not provide the same combination of oral practice, feedback and confidence-building.

Question:
What is one way the poem suggests elephants show friendship?

Options:


Correct Answer: By holding tails.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poem carefully and locate the line describing how elephants behave together — it explicitly says they walk holding each other's tails.  
Step 2: Interpret this action as a sign of friendship because physical contact like holding tails shows closeness and mutual support.  
Step 3: Other options (for example, trumpeting loudly, feeding each other, or touching trunks) are not the described behavior in the poem, so they are incorrect. Thus the correct answer is: by holding tails.

Question:
What should students be able to do after the lesson?

Options:
a. Draw elephants
b. Identify word stress and intonation
c. Sing songs
d. Dance


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: 
Step 1 — Identify the lesson objective: the phrase “identify word stress and intonation” refers to pronunciation and prosody skills students should acquire.  
Step 2 — Compare options: option b exactly matches that objective, while options a, c, and d (drawing elephants, singing songs, dancing) do not target word stress or intonation.  
Conclusion — Therefore the correct answer is b because it directly states the intended learning outcome; the other options are unrelated skills.

Question:
The poem encourages reading and listening activities.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poem and identify lines or words that invite action — look for imperative verbs or repeated phrases that tell the reader to "read," "listen," or participate.
Step 2: If the poem contains such invitations (for example direct commands or repeated urging to read and to listen), it is encouraging reading and listening activities.
Conclusion: Since the poem includes those encouraging lines, the correct answer is (a) True. Option (b) is incorrect because it denies the explicit encouragement present in the poem.

Question:
The phrase 'holding hands' refers to the elephants __________.

Options:
a. Walking
b. Eating
c. Playing
d. Dancing


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution: The phrase "holding hands" describes a physical connection used to move together, so for elephants it implies they are moving in unison — i.e., walking. Step 1: Interpret "holding hands" as an action that helps maintain contact and coordination between animals. Step 2: Among the choices, "walking" matches that coordinated movement. Other options are incorrect because "eating," "playing," and "dancing" do not specifically require holding hands as a means of staying together, so the correct answer is (a) Walking.

Question:
What mood does the poem aim to convey about the elephants?

Options:
a. Sad
b. Joyful
c. Angry
d. Fearful


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: কবিতাটির ভাষা ও চিত্রগুলো বিশ্লেষণ করুন — যদি বাক্যগুলোতে হাসি, খেলা, উৎসব বা উচ্ছ্বাসের প্রতিচ্ছবি থাকে, তা আনন্দবর্ষিত মেজাজকে নির্দেশ করে।  
ধাপ ২: কবিতায় হাতিদের আচরণ ও বর্ণনা যদি প্রাণবন্ত, খেলে মেতে ওঠা বা আনন্দিত হওয়ার ইঙ্গিত দেয়, তাহলে মেজাজটি স্পষ্টভাবে Joyful (উৎসাহী/আনন্দিত)। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো b।  
অপর বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ 'Sad' দুঃখজনক সুর, 'Angry' রাগের সুর এবং 'Fearful' ভয়গ্রস্ত সুর নির্দেশ করে—কবিতায় সেই ধরনের সংকেত নেই।

Question:
The poem is structured in a narrative form.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what "narrative form" means — a narrative poem tells a story with a clear sequence of events, characters, and a plot.  
Step 2: Examine the poem’s features — if it emphasizes mood, images, or personal reflection without a developed plot or action sequence, it is not narrative.  
Step 3: Conclude that the statement is false because the poem lacks the defining elements of a narrative, so option b (False) is correct; option a (True) is incorrect.

a. Large groups
b. Pairs
c. Individually
d. All of the above


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution:

Step 2: Evaluate feasibility: recitation can work in large groups (choral or group recitation), in pairs (dialogue or paired practice), and individually (solo performance).  
Step 3: Since all three formats are feasible, the correct choice is option d (All of the above).  
Explanation: Options a, b, and c are each valid formats rather than mutually exclusive, so none alone is the only correct answer.
