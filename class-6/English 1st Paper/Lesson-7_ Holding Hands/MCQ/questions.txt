Question:
The poet compares clouds to __________.

Options:
a. Melodies
b. Ships
c. Waves
d. Sunsets


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Read the line and spot the metaphor — clouds are described as moving across the sky like vessels that travel. That image corresponds to option b — Ships. Other options are less fitting: "Melodies" implies sound, "Waves" implies water motion rather than floating vessels, and "Sunsets" names a scene rather than something the clouds are likened to.

Question:
The focus is solely on grammar in the lesson.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the components of the lesson (grammar rules, vocabulary, pronunciation, skills practice, communicative activities).  
Step 2: Check whether the lesson contains any of these other components besides grammar — if it includes vocabulary building, speaking/listening tasks, or contextual usage, then the focus is not solely grammar.  
Step 3: Since the lesson includes elements beyond just grammar, the statement is false; therefore option b (False) is correct.  
Explanation: Option a (True) is incorrect because it asserts exclusivity of grammar, which is contradicted when the lesson also teaches vocabulary, usage, or communication practice.

Question:
The poem serves as a vehicle for __________.

Options:
a. travel
b. imagery
c. communication
d. education


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret "vehicle" as a medium that carries or conveys something (metaphorically).
Step 2: A poem most often uses sensory language, metaphors and vivid descriptions to create mental pictures, so it primarily serves as a vehicle for imagery — therefore option (b) is correct.
Step 3: Options (a) travel and (d) education are too literal or secondary, and (c) communication is true in a broad sense but less specific than imagery, which is the central function in poetic expression.

Question:
Describe the imagery used in the line about clouds.

Options:


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the line and pick out descriptive words — the clouds are called “pretty” and depicted as “sailing across the sky.”  
Step 2: Identify the imagery type — this is visual imagery (it creates a picture of gentle, attractive clouds) and mild personification/metaphor (comparing their movement to sailing).  
Step 3: Conclude the meaning — the line presents clouds as beautiful objects moving smoothly like ships across the sky, so the correct description is that clouds are described as pretty and sailing across the sky.  
Brief note on other choices: any options suggesting stormy, stationary, or gloomy clouds would be incorrect because the words emphasize beauty and motion, not darkness or stillness.

Question:
How does the poet feel about nature?

Options:
a. Indifferent
b. Admiring
c. Hostile
d. Fearful


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Read the poem for tone and imagery — the poet uses positive, praising descriptions and affectionate images of the natural world, which signals a favorable attitude.  
Step 2: Interpret that tone: positive imagery and admiration for nature indicate appreciation rather than indifference, hostility, or fear.  
Step 3: Conclude that the correct answer is b: Admiring, because the language and tone express wonder and praise, while options a, c, and d contradict the poem’s approving mood.

Question:
Students will only listen to the poem without any activities.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement and interpret it as a teaching practice claim — “Students will only listen to the poem without any activities.”  
Step 2: Evaluate against common pedagogical principles: listening-only approaches are passive and do not promote comprehension, retention, or speaking/writing skills; effective lessons include follow-up activities (questions, discussion, recitation, or tasks).  
Conclusion: The statement is false, so the correct answer is (b). Option (a) is incorrect because it assumes no activities are needed, which contradicts good instructional practice.

Question:
In the lesson, students will also learn to identify __________.

Options:
a. misprints
b. emotions
c. intonation
d. themes


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Step 1: Determine the lesson's focus — the phrase "learn to identify" in a spoken-language context most naturally refers to features of speech; "intonation" means the rise and fall of the voice that students can recognize.  
Step 2: Compare options — "misprints" are typographical errors (relevant to writing, not speech), "emotions" are internal states (may be inferred but are not a primary, teachable speech feature here), and "themes" are overall topics or ideas (a different reading/listening skill).  
Step 3: Conclusion — therefore the correct answer is option c: intonation.

Question:
What kind of educational activity will follow reading the poem?

Options:


Correct Answer: Recitation of the poem.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and identify the expected classroom sequence — after a poem is read, the typical follow-up activity is one that practices oral delivery.  
Step 2: Match options to that goal: "Recitation of the poem" directly practices pronunciation, memory and expressive reading, so it naturally follows reading.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options (e.g., discussion, drawing, quiz) because they focus on analysis, visualization, or testing rather than immediate oral practice.  
Therefore the correct answer is: Recitation of the poem.

What is the significance of bridges in the poem?

Options:
a. Symbol of connection
b. Only a literal object
c. A reference to travel
d. An outdated concept


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the common poetic use—bridges are frequently used as metaphors for connection, transition, or linking separate things.  
Step 2: Compare the options: a "Symbol of connection" matches the typical metaphorical meaning, so it fits best.  
Step 3: Explain why others are wrong: b is too literal, c (reference to travel) is only a partial, concrete interpretation, and d is not supported by poetic usage.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a).

The poem suggests that nature is less important than man-made objects.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the statement — it claims the poem places nature as less important than man-made objects.  
Step 2: Read the poem’s tone and key lines: the poem praises or foregrounds nature (or treats natural elements as central), so it does not downgrade nature in favor of artifacts.  
Step 3: Therefore the statement is false; select b (False). Option a is incorrect because it contradicts the poem’s emphasis on the value/importance of nature.

Options:
a. Rivers and mountains
b. Natural and artificial
c. Sky and sea
d. Action and stillness


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the lines of the poem and look for paired images or oppositions (keywords like “natural,” “man-made,” “built,” “wild,” “crafted,” “contrived”) that indicate a contrast type.
Step 2: Match the observed contrast to the options: the poem contrasts elements of the natural world with things made or altered by humans — that corresponds to option b (Natural and artificial).
Step 3: Briefly rule out others: option a (Rivers and mountains) and option c (Sky and sea) are both natural elements and not a natural vs. artificial contrast; option d (Action and stillness) is a behavioral or tonal contrast, not the specific natural vs. man-made opposition highlighted.
Answer: b.

Question:
What do students gain from recognizing intonation?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Define intonation — intonation is the pattern of pitch, stress and rhythm in spoken language that signals questions, statements, emotions and emphasis.
Step 2: How it affects understanding — by recognizing intonation, students can correctly interpret a speaker’s intent (e.g., question vs. statement, sarcasm, surprise), so comprehension of meaning and pragmatic cues improves.
Step 3: How it affects voice modulation — awareness of pitch and stress lets students control their own speaking voice to convey the right attitude or emphasis, improving expressiveness and clarity.
Step 4: Why other choices are less correct — options like “increased vocabulary” or “better grammar” may result indirectly from listening practice, but they are not the direct outcomes of recognizing intonation; the primary gains are better understanding and improved voice modulation.

Which aspect of the poem might capture students' interest the most?

Options:
a. The analysis of grammar
b. The vivid imagery
c. Historical context
d. The poem's length


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what typically draws students' attention in a poem — sensory detail and emotional appeal tend to engage most readers.  
Step 2: Compare the options: analysis of grammar is more technical and less immediately engaging, historical context can be interesting but is secondary, and the poem's length is neutral. Vivid imagery creates strong mental pictures and emotional resonance, so it most directly captures students' interest.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: The vivid imagery.

Question:
The poem has a collection of negative themes.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the statement — it claims the poem is a collection consisting mainly of negative themes.  
Step 2: Examine the poem’s themes: if the poem contains a mix of positive, neutral, and negative elements (or predominantly non-negative themes), then it cannot be described as a collection of negative themes.  
Step 3: Since the poem does not consist mainly of negative themes, the statement is false.  

Therefore the correct answer is b (False). Option a (True) is incorrect because it asserts that the poem is primarily negative, which contradicts the poem’s actual mix of themes.

Question:
Students are expected to __________ the poem after reading.

Options:
a. analyze
b. recite
c. dissect
d. translate


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Understand the context—after reading a poem in a classroom, the usual expected action is to perform it aloud or reproduce it from memory, which matches the verb "recite."  
Step 2: Compare options: "analyze" and "dissect" mean examining the poem's meaning or structure (less about performing), and "translate" means rendering it into another language (a different task).  
Therefore the best choice is b: recite.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the basic elements of sound commonly taught — pitch, duration (or time), intensity (loudness), timbre (tone color), and rhythm.  
Step 2: Identify which element students are asked to recognize; rhythm is the pattern of beats and timing in sound.  
Step 3: Therefore the answer is: Rhythm. (Other elements like pitch or timbre are also correct elements of sound, but the question only asks to name one.)

What does the poem convey about the beauty of nature?

Options:
a. It is unimportant.
b. It is significant and beautiful.
c. It is overrated.
d. It is temporary.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poem's key images and tone—if it uses admiring language, vivid descriptions, and positive emotion toward landscapes, that signals appreciation of nature's beauty.  
Step 2: Interpret: such language indicates the poem treats nature as significant and beautiful, so the correct choice is (b).  
Step 3: Why others are wrong: (a) contradicts the poem's praise, (c) "overrated" implies sarcasm or dismissal not present, and (d) "temporary" would be supported only by emphasis on transience, which the poem does not emphasize.

2. In practice, lessons labeled as reading comprehension often include related skills such as vocabulary, grammar, discussion, summarizing, or writing exercises, so they are not exclusive to reading.

The poem enhances students' __________ appreciation.

Options:

b. auditory
c. philosophical
d. emotional


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the primary sensory feature of a poem — poems commonly use rhythm, rhyme, meter, alliteration and onomatopoeia, which are sound-based devices that are best appreciated by listening.  
Step 2: Match the wording "enhances students' __________ appreciation" to the sensory domain most directly engaged by those features; that points to auditory appreciation.  
Step 3: Briefly eliminate others: visual is more for pictures or visual art, philosophical refers to abstract ideas (secondary), and emotional can be affected but is not the primary sensory mode the phrase implies.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) auditory.

Question:
Explain the symbolic meaning of 'bridges' in the poem.

Options:


Correct Answer: They symbolize connection and transition between different realms.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the image: note that a bridge in literature is a deliberate image often associated with joining two separate places.  
Step 2 — Analyze context and connotations: words or actions in the poem that suggest crossing, passage, meeting, or movement point to the bridge functioning as a link rather than a barrier.  
Step 3 — Draw the symbolic meaning: from those clues we conclude bridges symbolize connection and transition between different realms (e.g., past and present, life and death, inner and outer worlds).  
Step 4 — Briefly rule out alternatives: other readings (e.g., bridge as obstacle or prison) are less fitting because a bridge’s basic function—and the poem’s language about crossing or meeting—emphasizes passage and union rather than separation.

Question:
Bridges are compared to the bow that __________.

Options:
a. connects two rivers
b. overlooks the sea
c. bridges heaven
d. crosses valleys


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the metaphor — a “bow that bridges heaven” refers to a bow-like arc in the sky (a rainbow) that appears to link parts of the heavens.  
Step 2: A bridge similarly forms an arc or connection between two separated places, so the simile compares a physical bridge to that heavenly bow.  
Step 3: Therefore option c is correct. Options a, b and d are incorrect because they describe specific terrestrial functions (connecting rivers, overlooking the sea, crossing valleys) rather than the poetic image of an arc in the sky.

Options:


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Note the poem’s distinguishing features — a short, lyrical voice focused on memory, loss, religious undertones and simple, intimate diction — traits typical of Christina Georgina Rossetti (examples: “Remember”, “In an Artist’s Studio”, “Goblin Market”).
Step 2: Match those features to the list of author options and to Rossetti’s known themes and style.
Step 3: Conclude that the correct author is Christina Georgina Rossetti, because the poem’s themes, tone and diction align closely with her work.
Brief note on other options: other nineteenth-century poets (e.g., Tennyson, Browning, Keats) have different dominant themes and stylistic signatures (epic narrative, dramatic monologue, highly sensuous imagery), so they do not fit this poem as well.

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: Look for the image or metaphor in the line: the poem describes the clouds as moving across the sky smoothly and carrying things like they sail. Step 1: Identify the shared features — clouds drift and “sail” across the sky, which matches how ships move on water. Step 2: Compare options: rivers (flow on the ground), trees (stationary), bridges (fixed structures) do not match the idea of sailing through the sky. Therefore the correct answer is a: Ships.

Question:
What is the relationship between the bow and nature in the poem?

Options:


Correct Answer: The bow represents a rainbow and bridges heaven.

Solution:
Solution: Identify the symbol — the poem calls the bow an arching, colorful form in the sky, so we interpret it as a natural phenomenon rather than a man-made object. Reasoning — a bow that "bridges" heaven and displays colors corresponds to a rainbow, which is a common poetic symbol linking earth and sky. Conclusion — therefore the bow represents a rainbow and acts as a bridge to heaven. Other choices (for example, a weapon or mere decoration) are less consistent with the poem’s imagery of nature, color, and connection between earth and sky.

Options:
a. They are useful for sailing.
b. They are prettier than ships.
c. They are heavy and dark.
d. They block sunlight.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poetic line and identify the speaker’s attitude — the poet is making a direct aesthetic comparison between clouds and ships, emphasizing appearance.  
Step 2: Choose the option that matches that sentiment: option b states they are “prettier than ships,” which fits an aesthetic, admiring tone.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a (useful for sailing) is about function, not sentiment; option c (heavy and dark) and option d (block sunlight) express negative or physical attributes that contradict an admiring description.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Step 2: Match those features to literary forms: these characteristics correspond to a poem rather than prose forms.  
Step 3: Conclude the best choice is option b because the presence of verse structure and poetic devices indicates a poem.

Explanation why other options are incorrect:
- a (A short story), c (An essay) and d (A novella) are prose forms that use continuous paragraphs and narrative or expository prose, not stanzaic lines and poetic devices, so they do not fit the described text.

Step 2: Look for direct comparisons where one thing is described as being another (without using "like" or "as"); such usages signal a metaphor. These two checks identify "imagery" and "metaphor" as the devices used.  
Other options (e.g., simile, which uses "like" or "as", or personification, which gives nonhuman things human traits) are not supported if those specific markers are absent, so they are incorrect here.

Question:
What is emphasized about the bow in the context of the poem?

Options:
a. It is man-made.
b. It is more beautiful than natural objects.
c. It is used for sailing.
d. It is a solid form.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the poem lines that describe the bow: it is directly compared with flowers, stars, and green leaves and said to surpass them in appearance — this shows the poet is stressing its beauty.
2. Match that emphasis to the options: option (b) "It is more beautiful than natural objects" exactly captures the comparison and the poet’s claim.
3. Explain why other options are wrong: (a) being man-made is not the poem’s focus, (c) used for sailing is irrelevant, and (d) being a solid form is not asserted or emphasized.
4. Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
The poem includes comparisons to rivers and seas.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Scan the poem for imagery and similes — lines that liken something to rivers or seas (for example, references to flowing water, waves, or "like a river/sea").  
Step 2: Identify that the poem explicitly uses such comparisons to convey motion, depth, or continuity, so the statement "The poem includes comparisons to rivers and seas" is supported by the text.  
Therefore the correct answer is a (True). Option b (False) is incorrect because it denies the explicit river/sea comparisons present in the poem.

Question:
The bow that bridges heaven is __________.

Options:
a. an illusion
b. a rainbow
c. a bridge
d. a ship


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the phrase "the bow that bridges heaven" and note key words: "bow" (an arch) and "bridges heaven" (spans the sky).
2. A rainbow is a curved, bow-like band of colors that appears across the sky after rain, so it fits the description directly — therefore the correct answer is b (a rainbow).
3. Other options are incorrect because: "an illusion" is too vague (a rainbow is an optical phenomenon but commonly called a rainbow), "a bridge" and "a ship" are literal objects that do not form an arch across the sky.

What does the author hope students will enjoy?

Options:

Question:
What do students learn to recite after reading the poem?

Options:
a. A summary
b. The poem itself
c. An analysis
d. A critique


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the verb "recite" — it means to repeat aloud from memory or read aloud the original text.  
Step 2: After reading a poem, the natural learning outcome tied to "recite" is to be able to say the poem itself aloud.  
Step 3: Therefore option (b) "The poem itself" is correct; options (a) "A summary", (c) "An analysis", and (d) "A critique" are different activities (condensing, examining, or evaluating) and do not match the specific action "recite."

Question:
The poem contains only positive imagery.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poem and identify the images used (e.g., sunlight, blossoms, warm breeze) and note their emotional tone — all examples point to positive, uplifting associations.  
Step 2: Since every identified image conveys a positive feeling and no negative or bleak imagery appears, the statement is true.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a). Option (b) is incorrect because it claims the poem contains non-positive imagery, which is not supported by the text.

Question:
Students will develop skills in recognizing __________ sound.

Options:
a. emotion
b. English
c. artistic
d. rhythmic


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the context of the sentence—students developing skills suggests a language-learning or listening skill context.  
Step 2: Choose the option that grammatically and semantically completes the phrase “recognizing __________ sound.” “English” fits naturally as “recognizing English sound(s)” (i.e., recognizing English phonemes/pronunciation).  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: “emotion” and “artistic” do not collocate well with “sound” in this educational context, and “rhythmic” refers to beat/patterns rather than a general skill students are commonly taught to recognize. Therefore the correct answer is b: English.

Question:
List one aspect of intonation students will recognize.

Options:


Correct Answer: Variations in pitch or tone.

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: Intonation বলতে বোঝায় বাক্যের মধ্যে স্বরের উচ্চতা (pitch) ও টোনের ওঠানামা যা অর্থ, মনোভাব বা বাক্যের ধরণ প্রকাশ করে।  
ধাপ ২: তাই ছাত্ররা একটি স্বীকৃত দিক হিসেবে চিনতে পারবে "স্বরের উচ্চতা বা টোনে বিভিন্নতা" — যেমন প্রশ্নে স্বর ওঠে, বিবৃতিতে স্বর নামে।  
ধাপ ৩: সংক্ষেপে, intonation-এর এক স্পষ্ট দিক হল স্বরের উচ্চতার পরিবর্তন; অন্যান্য বৈশিষ্ট্য যেমন স্ট্রেস বা তালও প্রাসঙ্গিক হলেও intonation মূলত পিচ/টোনের পরিবর্তনকে বোঝায়।
