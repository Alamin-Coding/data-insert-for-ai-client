Question:
How does Hason Raja's transformation from a life of luxury to a mystic poet reflect a similar journey of understanding and sacrifice found in the narratives of Bangladeshi independence?

Options:


Correct Answer: Both involve a deep reflection on life and a commitment to a greater cause beyond personal comfort.

Solution:


Explanation:
Both involve a deep inner reflection that shifts priorities from personal comfort to a larger purpose. Hason Raja’s move from luxury to mystic poetry shows a willingness to renounce material life for spiritual truth, just as independence movements required people to give up safety and comfort for the nation’s freedom. In both cases the inner transformation justifies sacrifice and links individual change to a greater collective cause.
