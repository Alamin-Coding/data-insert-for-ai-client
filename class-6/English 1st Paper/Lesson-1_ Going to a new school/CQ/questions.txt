Question:
How does Bulbul’s job as a cleaner impact the community of Sankar, especially when he is unable to perform his duties?

Options:


Correct Answer: When Bulbul is unable to collect rubbish, the community becomes dirty and unhygienic.

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
State the direct role of Bulbul’s work, identify the processes that fail when he cannot perform them, and deduce the community-level consequences using public-health and sanitation principles.

Essential steps:
1. Identify Bulbul’s duties: regular collection and removal of household and street rubbish, keeping drains and public spaces clear.  
2. Consider what happens when those duties stop: rubbish accumulates on streets, in yards, and in drains.  
3. Trace the chain of effects: accumulation → breeding grounds for pests and pathogens → spread of disease and bad odors → environmental and social problems (blocked drains, flooding, reduced quality of life).  
4. Summarize the net impact on the community.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Sanitation and waste management: timely removal of waste prevents environmental contamination.  
- Disease ecology: accumulated organic waste attracts vectors (flies, rodents, mosquitoes) that can transmit diseases (diarrhea, dengue, leptospirosis, etc.).  
- Public hygiene and communal wellbeing: cleanliness affects mental comfort, local economy, and risk of outbreaks.  
- Infrastructure interaction: blocked drains from waste increase flood risk and water contamination.

Logical reasoning (concise chain):
- When Bulbul does not collect rubbish, waste accumulates in public spaces and drains.  
- Accumulated waste provides food and shelter for pests and allows water to stagnate, creating breeding sites for mosquitoes.  
- Increased vector and pathogen presence raises the risk of infectious diseases and causes foul smells and visual pollution.  
- Blocked drains lead to waterlogging and possible contamination of water sources, worsening sanitation problems.  
- Therefore, the community becomes dirty, unhygienic, and more vulnerable to health and environmental problems.

Example (brief, illustrative):
If household garbage is left uncollected for several days, organic waste ferments and attracts flies and rats; stagnant water in clogged drains allows mosquitoes to breed, raising the risk of dengue and diarrheal diseases in the neighborhood.

Conclusion:
Bulbul’s absence in carrying out his cleaning duties directly causes the community of Sankar to become dirty and unhygienic, increasing health risks and lowering residents’ quality of life.
