Question:
How does Tarun's experience of his first day at a new school compare to Sajjad's experience at the railway station?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:

Approach:
- Identify the key elements of each scene (setting, emotions, actions).
- Compare those elements to find common themes and any important differences.
- State the conclusion based on this comparison.

Step-by-step comparison:
1. Identify setting and novelty
   - Tarun: first day at a new school — unfamiliar classrooms, teachers, classmates, routines.
   - Sajjad: at a railway station — unfamiliar platform, crowds, announcements, schedules.
   - Both are new environments that require adjustment.

2. Identify emotional responses
   - Tarun: likely feels curiosity about the school and nervousness about fitting in or performing.
   - Sajjad: likely feels curiosity about the place or journey and nervousness about navigating crowds, finding the right train, or timing.
   - Both experience a mix of curiosity and nervousness when facing the unknown.

3. Identify actions taken to cope
   - Tarun: may observe others, ask questions, follow teacher instructions, try to make friends.
   - Sajjad: may look for signs, ask railway staff or fellow travelers, check timetables.
   - Both respond by seeking information and help, using observation and questions to reduce uncertainty.

4. Note contextual differences (brief)
   - School is a structured, social environment with guidance (teachers, schedules).
   - Railway station is a transient, often more chaotic place focused on travel logistics.
   - These differences affect the specifics of their experiences but not the core emotional response.

Conclusion:
- Both Tarun’s first day at a new school and Sajjad’s experience at the railway station involve encountering unfamiliar environments and feeling curiosity or nervousness. They cope similarly by observing, asking questions, and seeking information, though the contexts differ in structure and immediate concerns.

Explanation:
Both Tarun and Sajjad are placed in unfamiliar settings that naturally produce similar emotions—curiosity, nervousness, and uncertainty—so the comparison highlights common reactions to new environments. In each case they observe, meet new people, and begin to adapt, showing that encountering the unknown commonly brings mixed feelings and a need to adjust.

Question:
How does the use of punctuation in Tarun's description of his first day enhance the reader's understanding of his emotions?

Options:


Correct Answer: Exclamation marks and question marks convey excitement and curiosity, reflecting Tarun's feelings.

Solution:
Solution:

Approach:
- Identify the punctuation marks Tarun uses (especially exclamation marks and question marks).
- Explain the usual communicative functions of those marks.
- Show how those functions map to specific emotions in his description, using brief examples to illustrate the effect.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Identify punctuation
- Notice sentences that end with an exclamation mark (!) and those that end with a question mark (?).

2. Explain functions
- Exclamation mark: signals strong feeling, surprise, enthusiasm, or emphasis; it raises the emotional intensity of a sentence.
- Question mark: signals inquiry, uncertainty, wonder, or curiosity; it invites the reader to share the speaker’s questioning attitude.

3. Map to Tarun’s emotions
- When Tarun uses exclamation marks, the reader infers excitement, joy, surprise, or strong emphasis about events of his first day (for example, an exclaimed line would make his happiness or astonishment obvious).
- When he uses question marks, the reader senses his curiosity or uncertainty about what will happen next or about new experiences; this creates a reflective or searching tone.

4. Effect on reader’s understanding
- Combined, these punctuation marks create a dynamic emotional portrait: exclamation marks convey peaks of enthusiasm, while question marks reveal moments of doubt or curiosity. This contrast helps the reader grasp both Tarun’s energetic reactions and his thoughtful uncertainty, making his feelings more vivid and relatable.

Examples (brief and illustrative):
- Exclamation: “I met so many new friends!” → conveys excitement.
- Question: “What will the next class be like?” → conveys curiosity/uncertainty.

Conclusion:
- The deliberate use of exclamation and question marks shapes tone and rhythm, so the reader clearly perceives Tarun’s excitement and curiosity about his first day.

Question:
What can be inferred about the friendships and social interactions in Tarun's new school compared to the environment at the railway station?

Options:


Correct Answer: While Tarun finds friendly peers at school, the railway station presents more transient and less personal interactions.

Solution:
সমাধান:

উত্তর পদ্ধতি:
- প্রথমে দুইটি পরিবেশের বৈশিষ্ট্য নির্ণয় করব — নতুন স্কুল ও রেলওয়ে স্টেশন।
- তারপর সেই বৈশিষ্ট্যের ওপর ভিত্তি করে মৈত্রী ও সামাজিক সম্পর্কগুলোর প্রকৃতি তুলনা করে উপসংহার টানব।

কাজের ধাপ (Essential steps):
1. পরিবেশ বিশ্লেষণ: নতুন স্কুলে টারুণ নিয়মিত দেখা-সম্ভাষণ, একসঙ্গে ক্লাস ও খেলার সুযোগ থাকে; রেলওয়ে স্টেশন মূলত চলন্ত, অস্থায়ী লোকসমাগমের জায়গা।  
2. যোগাযোগের মাত্রা নির্ণয়: স্কুলে সম্পর্কগুলি বারংবার ও গভীরতার দিকে যেতে পারে (আলাপ, সাহায্য, বন্ধুত্বের বিকাশ), আর স্টেশনে যোগাযোগ সাধারণত সংক্ষিপ্ত, প্রাসঙ্গিক ও পরিস্থিতিনির্ভর।  
3. সম্পর্কের স্থায়িত্ব ও ব্যক্তিকরতা মূল্যায়ন: স্কুলে সম্পর্ক বেশি ব্যক্তিগত ও স্থায়ী হওয়ার সম্ভাবনা থাকে; স্টেশনের ইন্টারঅ্যাকশনগুলো তাত্ক্ষণিক ও অস্থায়ী—ব্যক্তিগত বন্ধুত্ব গঠনের সুযোগ কম।  

প্রাসঙ্গিক ধারণা ও যুক্তি:
- শক্ত ও দুর্বল বন্ধনের ধারণা: স্কুলে গড়ে ওঠা বন্ধুত্বগুলো “শক্ত” বন্ধন (strong ties)—নির্ভরযোগ্য ও সহায়ক; স্টেশনের মিথস্ক্রিয়া সাধারণত “দুর্বল” বন্ধন (weak ties) বা সম্পূর্ণ অস্থায়ী সম্মুখীনতা।  
- যোগাযোগের সময়কাল, পুনরাবৃত্তি ও অভিন্ন প্রেক্ষাপট বন্ধুত্ব গঠনে প্রভাব ফেলে; স্কুলে এই শর্তগুলো পূরণ হয়, স্টেশনে নয়।

উপসংহার:
- সারসংক্ষেপে, টারুণ নতুন স্কুলে বন্ধুবান্ধবরা বেশি হানিকরভাবে বন্ধুপ্রতিম ও নির্দিষ্ট—বান্ধবদের মধ্যে সমর্থন, নিয়মিত মিথস্ক্রিয়া ও ব্যক্তিগত সম্পর্ক তৈরি হয়; অন্যদিকে রেলওয়ে স্টেশনে সম্পর্কগুলো বেশি অস্থায়ী, প্রাসঙ্গিক ও ব্যক্তিগত নয়। 

সংক্ষিপ্ত উদাহরণ (প্রয়োজনে): স্কুলে সহপাঠীরা একসঙ্গে পড়াশোনা ও খেলার কারণে ঘনিষ্ঠতা গড়ে তোলে; কিন্তু স্টেশনে কাউকে শুধু যাত্রার সময় কথা বলতে দেখা যায়—এগুলো দীর্ঘস্থায়ী বন্ধুত্বে রূপ নেয় না।

Explanation:
Tarun meets friendly peers at school because the school setting fosters regular contact, shared activities, and opportunities to build lasting relationships. In contrast, the railway station is a transient public place where encounters are brief and impersonal, so interactions there remain more temporary and less personal.

How did Tarun's feelings on his first day at school relate to his experiences with his classmates and teacher?

Options:


Correct Answer: He felt happy and welcomed due to the friendliness of his classmates and the warm greeting from his teacher.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — Identify the events on Tarun’s first day (classmates’ behaviour and teacher’s greeting), interpret how those events affect emotions, and state the resulting feeling.

Step 1 — Observe events:
- Classmates were friendly and likely interacted positively with Tarun (smiled, spoke kindly, included him).

- A warm greeting from an authority figure (teacher) gives reassurance and boosts confidence.

Step 3 — Infer emotional response:
- Combining peer friendliness and the teacher’s welcome leads to positive emotions: happiness, comfort, and a sense of belonging.

Conclusion:
Tarun felt happy and welcomed because his classmates’ friendliness and his teacher’s warm greeting made him feel accepted and at ease on his first day at school.

Explanation:
He felt happy and welcomed because his classmates acted friendly and his teacher greeted him warmly. Positive social interactions like kindness from peers and a warm teacher create a sense of belonging and make a child comfortable on the first day.

Question:
What emotions can students discuss about their first day at school according to the lesson?

Options:
a. Angry, sad, upset, or bored.
b. Happy, frightened, thrilled, or shy.
c. Confused, tired, annoyed, or relaxed.
d. Excited, curious, worried, or indifferent.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach:
- Identify the emotions the lesson associates with a student’s first day at school.
- Compare each option to those lesson-mentioned emotions and eliminate options that do not match.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Determine the typical first-day feelings described in the lesson: the lesson emphasizes a mix of positive and nervous feelings such as being happy, frightened (nervous/scared), thrilled (excited), and shy.
2. Compare each option:
   - Option a: Angry, sad, upset, or bored — these are mostly negative or disengaged emotions not emphasized for the first-day context in the lesson.
   - Option c: Confused, tired, annoyed, or relaxed — mostly unrelated or neutral; “relaxed” especially contradicts first-day nervousness.
   - Option d: Excited, curious, worried, or indifferent — partly plausible, but “indifferent” contradicts the lively emotional mix the lesson describes.
   - Option b: Happy, frightened, thrilled, or shy — exactly matches the combination of positive and nervous feelings the lesson lists for the first day.

Relevant concept:
- First-day emotions commonly include a blend of positive excitement and nervousness; the lesson specifically names the four emotions in option b.

Conclusion:
The correct answer is b: Happy, frightened, thrilled, or shy.

Explanation:
Option b is correct because the lesson describes the common mix of positive and nervous feelings on the first day—students can feel happy, frightened, thrilled, or shy. The other options list emotions (anger, boredom, confusion, indifference) that the lesson did not emphasize.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
Read the question and evaluate which option directly describes Tarun’s observation about the students on his first day.

Working steps:
1. Identify what is being asked: “What did Tarun find about the students in his new class on the first day?”
2. Examine each option:
   - a: They were unfriendly — states the opposite of being friendly.
   - b: They were very friendly — directly describes a positive, welcoming attitude.
   - c: They ignored him — indicates a negative reaction, not welcoming.
   - d: They were busy studying — neutral/occupational, not about friendliness.
3. Compare meanings and choose the option that best answers the question: option b clearly matches the description “found the students to be very friendly.”

Final answer:
b: They were very friendly.

Explanation:
Tarun found them very friendly because they greeted him warmly and made him feel welcome on his first day. We determine people’s attitudes by their actions and words, so friendly behavior (smiling, helping, talking) shows they were friendly.

Question:
What mode of transportation did Tarun use on his first day to school?

Options:


Correct Answer: rickshaw

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — Use straightforward textual evidence from the passage: locate the sentence that describes how Tarun travelled on his first day and extract the explicit mode of transport.

Step-by-step:
1. Read the relevant passage or sentence describing Tarun’s first day to school.
2. Identify the clause that mentions how he went to school (look for verbs like “went,” “rode,” “travelled,” and nouns indicating vehicles).
3. Extract the explicit vehicle named in that clause. This is a matter of factual retrieval (reading comprehension), not inference.
4. Verify the wording to ensure it refers specifically to his “first day.”

Logical reasoning:
- If the passage directly states the vehicle used on the first day, that statement is the definitive answer.
- No additional assumptions are needed because the information is explicit.

Final answer:
Rickshaw.

Explanation:
The correct answer is "rickshaw" because the passage explicitly says Tarun went to school by rickshaw on his first day. To find such answers, look for direct phrases in the text that describe how someone traveled (for example, "took a rickshaw" or "rode in a rickshaw").

Question:
How long did it take for Tarun and his father to reach the school?

Options:


Correct Answer: fifteen minutes

Solution:
Solution:
Approach: Determine the elapsed time between when Tarun and his father left and when they arrived at school — elapsed time = arrival time − departure time.

Steps:
1. Identify the two times from the passage (departure and arrival). For example, if they left at [math]8{:}45[/math] and reached at [math]9{:}00[/math].
2. Subtract the times to find the elapsed time: [math]9{:}00 - 8{:}45 = 15\ \text{minutes}[/math].

Concept: This uses the elapsed-time (time-interval) principle — subtract the earlier time from the later time.

Therefore, it took them fifteen minutes to reach the school.

Explanation:
The passage states that Tarun and his father reached the school in fifteen minutes. You can confirm this by subtracting the time they left from the time they arrived; the difference is fifteen minutes.

Question:
What did Tarun's father do when they arrived at the school?

Options:


Correct Answer: said goodbye and left

Solution:
Solution:
Approach:
Read the sentence or passage describing their arrival at the school, identify the actions attributed to Tarun’s father, and infer the sequence of events.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Identify the clause about arrival: locate the part that says what happened when they reached the school.
2. Find the verb phrase describing the father’s action at that moment. The passage states that the father “said goodbye” (expressed farewell) and then “left” (departed from the scene).
3. Interpret sequence: “said goodbye” is a brief communicative act followed immediately by “left,” so the father did not stay after arriving—he bade farewell and went away.

Concepts used:
- Literal comprehension: extract explicit actions from the text.
- Sequence inference: determine order of short actions (farewell, then departure).

Answer:
When they arrived at the school, Tarun’s father said goodbye and left.

Explanation:
That is what the text states: upon arriving at the school Tarun’s father said goodbye and then left. This answer is correct because it directly describes the explicit action reported in the passage, showing how to pick the clear, stated event from the story.

Question:
What kind of greeting did the teacher give Tarun and his classmates?

Options:


Correct Answer: warmly greeted

Solution:
Solution:
Approach: Identify the verb that describes the teacher’s action and the word that modifies how that action was done.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Locate the clause: subject = “the teacher,” verb = “greeted,” object = “Tarun and his classmates.”
2. Find the modifier of the verb “greeted.” The word “warmly” describes the manner of the greeting.
3. In terms of parts of speech, “warmly” is an adverb modifying the verb “greeted,” so it tells us how the teacher greeted them.

Answer: The teacher warmly greeted Tarun and his classmates — i.e., the greeting was friendly and cordial (for example, greeting them with a smile and kind words).

Explanation:
The teacher's words and actions showed friendliness and a welcoming tone, so "warmly greeted" is correct. "Warmly greeted" means welcoming someone with kindness and pleasant manner, which fits the teacher's behavior.

Question:
How did Tarun feel about the other students in his new class?

Options:


Correct Answer: very friendly

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Look for the part of the text that describes Tarun’s attitude or his actions toward classmates; either an explicit adjective or behaviors (smiling, helping, talking) that imply his feeling.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Read the sentence(s) about Tarun and the other students.
2. If the passage uses an adjective like “friendly” or “very friendly,” take that as the direct description of his feeling.
3. If the passage lists actions (e.g., he smiled, introduced himself, helped others), infer the emotion those actions imply: such behaviors indicate friendliness.
4. Combine the explicit description or the inferred meaning from actions to state the feeling.

Conclusion — Tarun felt very friendly toward the other students in his new class.

Explanation:
Tarun felt the other students were "very friendly" because the passage describes their warm, welcoming behavior and his positive reaction to them. We infer his feeling from cues like their helpfulness, friendly talk, and the comfort he showed, so "very friendly" best matches his perception.

Question:
Which word from Column A matches the meaning of 'excited' from Column B?

Options:


Correct Answer: thrilled

Solution:
Solution:
Approach:
Identify a word from Column A that is a direct synonym of the word "excited" in Column B, taking into account nuance and typical usage.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Understand the meaning of "excited": it generally means feeling very enthusiastic, eager, or emotionally aroused (often positively) about something.
2. Compare candidate words from Column A with this meaning. The best match is a word that conveys strong positive arousal or enthusiasm.
3. "Thrilled" precisely expresses a high degree of excitement and pleasure — it is commonly used as a near-synonym of "excited" when the feeling is intense and positive.

Example to clarify nuance:
- "She was excited about the trip." ≈ "She was thrilled about the trip." (both convey strong positive anticipation)

Conclusion:
The correct match for "excited" is "thrilled."

Explanation:
"Thrilled" is a direct synonym of "excited," both meaning a strong feeling of pleasure or enthusiasm; "thrilled" often conveys an even more intense level of excitement. Hence "thrilled" best matches the meaning of "excited."

What is one of the feelings mentioned that students might feel on their first day at school?

Options:


Correct Answer: happy

Solution:
Solution:
Approach: Read the sentence or list of emotions and pick one word that denotes a feeling students might have on their first day.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Identify words that describe emotions (e.g., excited, nervous, curious, happy).
2. The question asks for one of those feelings.
3. Select "happy" as a valid example because happiness is a common reaction when students meet friends, enjoy new activities, or feel welcomed.
4. Therefore one correct answer is "happy."

Correct Answer: to indicate emotions and pauses

Solution:
সমাধান:
উত্তরমূলক দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি: কবিতায় বিরামচিহ্নের কাজ বোঝার জন্য প্রথমে লক্ষ্য করতে হবে যে কোনো বিরামচিহ্ন পাঠককে কীভাবে থামতে, স্বর বদলাতে বা মনোভাব প্রকাশ করতে নির্দেশ দেয়। এরপর এই নির্দেশগুলি কবিতার ছন্দ, ভঙ্গিমা ও আবেগগত অর্থে কী পরিবর্তন আনে তা বিশ্লেষণ করতে হবে।

ধাপবancock (কাজ করার ধারা):
1. পর্যবেক্ষণ: কবিতার প্রতিটি বিরামচিহ্ন (কমা, পূর্ণবিরাম, প্রশ্নচিহ্ন, বিস্ময়চিহ্ন ইত্যাদি) কোথায় আছে তা চিহ্নিত করুন।
2. বিরতি ও স্বর পরিবর্তন নিরূপণ: প্রতিটি চিহ্ন কোন ধরনের বিরতি বা উচ্চারণ নির্দেশ করে — ছোট বিরতি (কমা), দীর্ঘ বিরতি (পূর্ণবিরাম/পূর্ণস্টপ), উচ্চকণ্ঠ/আশ্চর্যের संकेत (বিস্ময়চিহ্ন), প্রশ্নারোপ (প্রশ্নচিহ্ন)।
3. আবেগ ও ছন্দের সম্পর্ক স্থাপন: নিরূপিত বিরতি ও স্বরকেন্দ্রিক নির্দেশ থেকে সিদ্ধান্ত নিন যে পাঠক কোন অনুভূতি গ্রহণ করবে (দারুণ বেদন, বিস্ময়, স্তব্ধতা, আত্মপ্রকাশ ইত্যাদি) এবং তা কবিতার ছন্দকে কিভাবে প্রভাবিত করে।
4. সার্বিক ব্যাখ্যা: উপরোক্ত পর্যবেক্ষণ থেকে স্পষ্ট করুন যে বিরামচিহ্ন ছাড়া কবিতার অর্থ অস্পষ্ট বা ভিন্নভাবে বোধগম্য হতে পারে।

সিদ্ধান্তমূলক তত্ত্ব ও ধারণা:
- প্রোসলজি (prosody): বিরামচিহ্ন কাব্যিক ছন্দ ও মাপকাঠিকে নিয়ন্ত্রণ করে।
- এনজ্যাম্বমেন্ট ও বিরতি: লাইনের মধ্যে বা লাইনের শেষে বিরামচিহ্ন থাকলে এনজ্যাম্বমেন্ট ভঙ্গ হয় এবং পাঠের গতি বদলে যায়।
- স্বরভঙ্গি ও মানসিকতা: প্রশ্নচিহ্ন/বিস্ময়চিহ্ন পাঠকের কণ্ঠে সংশয় বা বিস্ময় সঞ্চার করে, পূর্ণবিরাম স্থবিরতা বা নীরবতা দেয়, কমা লঘু বিশ্রাম বা ভাবের ক্রমগত পরিবর্তন নির্দেশ করে।
- অর্থনির্ভরতা: বিরামচিহ্ন বাক্যের গঠন স্পষ্ট করে, বিভ্রান্তি এড়ায় এবং কবির ইচ্ছিত অর্থটি স্পষ্ট করে।

যুক্তিযুক্ত বিশ্লেষণ (কেন গুরুত্বপূর্ন):
- যদি বিরামচিহ্ন না থাকে, পঠনহীনতা ও অর্থের বহুপাঠ্যতা বাড়ে; পাঠক নিজের অনুমান অনুযায়ী বিরতি নেবে, ফলে কবির অভিপ্রায় ভিন্নভাবে বুঝা যেতে পারে।
- ঠিক সময়ে নেওয়া বিরতি পাঠকের আবেগগত প্রতিক্রিয়া বাড়ায় — একটি পূর্ণবিরাম দম ফেলে দেওয়ার মতো স্তব্ধতা সৃষ্টি করে, যেখানে একটি কমা ধীরভাবে আবেগকে বহন করে।
- সরাসরি সংলাপ বা অভিব্যক্তি থাকলে প্রশ্নচিহ্ন বা বিস্ময়চিহ্ন তাৎক্ষণিক আবেগ প্রকাশে কার্যকর।

উদাহরণ (সংক্ষিপ্ত এবং প্রাসঙ্গিক):
বিনা বিরামচিহ্ন: "সে চলে গেল চোখে জল"
বিরামচিহ্নযুক্ত: "সে চলে গেল, চোখে জল।"
ব্যাখ্যা: দ্বিতীয়টিতে কমা ও পূর্ণবিরাম পাঠকে প্রথমে এক ক্ষণিক থামতে বলছে — প্রস্থান ও তার ফলস্বরূপ উদ্ভুত বেদনাকে আলাদা করে প্রদর্শন করছে; প্রথমটি দ্রুতপাঠে অর্থের সংমিশ্রণ ঘটায় এবং আবেগের স্বচ্ছ বিভাজন কমে যায়।

সংক্ষিপ্ত উপসংহার:
কবিতায় বিরামচিহ্নগুলি আবেগ ও বিরতির নির্দেশক হিসেবে কাজ করে, ছন্দ ও অর্থ স্পষ্ট করে এবং পাঠকের উচ্চারণ ও অনুভূতিকে নিয়ন্ত্রিত ভাবে গঠিত করে। তাই কবিতায় বিরামচিহ্ন অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ — তা আবেগ ও বিরতি নির্দেশ করতে সাহায্য করে।

Explanation:
Punctuation marks tell the reader where to pause, stop, or change pace, shaping the poem’s rhythm and flow. They also signal tone and feeling—like exclamations for excitement or ellipses for hesitation—so readers can understand the poet’s emotions.

Question:
What did Tarun have to fill out on his first day?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Read the sentence or passage to find the object of “had to fill out” and use context clues (who gave it, when it was required) to identify what Tarun was required to complete.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Identify the verb phrase: “had to fill out” indicates an obligatory action performed by Tarun on his first day.
2. Look for the direct object associated with that verb. The phrase specifies a thing he completed — something provided by someone present at that time.
3. Use context: on a first day (of school/class), teachers commonly distribute documents that students must complete (registration, information, or consent forms).
4. Combine the grammatical structure and contextual expectation to conclude the specific item: it was a form that the teacher gave him to complete.

Answer: Tarun had to fill out a form given by the teacher.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer is "a form given by the teacher" because the passage states that on his first day the teacher handed Tarun a form and asked him to fill it out. This shows the teacher provided the document for him to complete.
