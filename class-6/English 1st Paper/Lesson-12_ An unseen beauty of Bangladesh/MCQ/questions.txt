Question:
Based on Tarun's experience on his first day at school and the poem about the fun after lessons, how can we compare feelings of excitement and fear in new environments?

Options:
a. Both excitement and fear are present, but excitement usually overcomes fear.
b. Fear is more common than excitement in new situations.
c. Excitement is only felt during fun activities, while fear is felt all the time.
d. Excitement and fear cannot coexist in a new environment.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From Tarun's first day we note both excitement (new experiences, meeting classmates) and fear (nervousness about school) are present.  
Step 2: The poem about fun after lessons emphasizes how enjoyable activities reduce anxiety and increase excitement.  
Step 3: Comparing the two, the evidence shows excitement and fear can coexist in new environments, but the positive excitement usually outweighs or overcomes the fear, so option (a) is correct.

Why other options are incorrect: (b) contradicts the examples that show excitement as well as fear; (c) wrongly separates excitement and fear into exclusive, constant states; (d) is false because the texts demonstrate they can coexist.

Question:
What is the primary feeling that Tarun experienced on his first day at the new school?

Options:
a. Excited
b. Scared
c. Happy
d. Frustrated


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: On the first day at a new school the dominant emotion described is anticipation and eagerness to meet new people and explore the place, which corresponds to being "excited."  
Step 2: Therefore option a ("Excited") best matches the primary feeling.  
Step 3: Other options are less fitting: b ("Scared") implies fear, c ("Happy") is positive but less specific about eager anticipation, and d ("Frustrated") implies annoyance—none describe the typical first‑day eagerness as well as "Excited."  
Answer: a: Excited.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপে ধাপে বিশ্লেষণ করলে "friendly" অর্থ বন্ধুসুলভ বা আন্তরিক আচরণ। বিকল্পগুলোর মধ্যে ক (They ignored him) ও গ (They laughed at him) শত্রুভাব বা উদাসীনতা বোঝায়, যা বন্ধুত্বপূর্ণ নয়, এবং ঘ (They were not in class) প্রশ্নের পরিস্থিতির সঙ্গে ঠিক মেলে না। শুধুমাত্র বিকল্প b (They warmly greeted him) হল এমন আচরণ যা বন্ধুসুলভকে নির্দেশ করে। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল b।

How did the teacher greet Tarun and his classmates?

Options:
a. Coldly
b. Warmly
c. Loudly
d. Indifferently


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the sentence or context about how the teacher addressed Tarun and his classmates and note descriptive cues (e.g., smiling, pleasant tone, welcoming words).
2. Match those cues to the answer choices: friendly, welcoming behavior corresponds to "Warmly".
3. Therefore the correct choice is (b) Warmly.

Explanation of why other options are incorrect:
- (a) Coldly and (d) Indifferently imply unfriendly or emotionless behavior, which contradicts the friendly cues.
- (c) Loudly refers to volume, not friendliness, so it does not best match the described warm, welcoming greeting.

Options:
a. The school has no recreational activities
b. They might not know anyone
c. They are late for class
d. The school is very far


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রথম দিন স্কুলে একজন ছাত্র সাধারণত নতুন পরিবেশ, নতুন শিক্ষক ও অপরিচিত সহপাঠী দেখে অজানা কারণে আশঙ্কা বা ভয় পেতে পারে।  
ধাপ ২: তাই সবচেয়ে সাধারণ কারণ হলো তারা কারওকে চিনে না—অর্থাৎ কারো সাথে পরিচয় নেই এবং পরিচিত মুখের অভাব তাদের অনিশ্চিত ও ভীত করে, যা ব অপশনের সঙ্গে মেলে।  

ব্যাখ্যা: 
- অপশন a (স্কুলে বিনোদন নেই) দীর্ঘমেয়াদি অসন্তোষ সৃষ্টি করতে পারে কিন্তু প্রথম দিন ভয়ের সরাসরি কারণ নয়।  
- অপশন c (ক্লাসে দেরি) উদ্বেগ বা লজ্জার কারণ হতে পারে কিন্তু সাধারণভাবে “ভয়” হিসেবে সবচেয়ে কম সাধারণ।  
- অপশন d (স্কুল খুব দূরে) কষ্ট বা অসুবিধা জাগাতে পারে কিন্তু প্রথম দিন অপরিচিত মানুষের কারণে অনুভূত ভয়ের সরাসরি কারণ নয়।

Correct Answer: খ

Step 3: Therefore select b. The other options are incorrect because they state different modes of transport (bicycle, car, train) which do not match the given correct answer.

Question:
How did Tarun feel about his new classmates?

Options:
a. Afraid
b. Bored
c. Happy
d. Angry


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Find the words or sentences in the text that describe Tarun’s reaction to his new classmates (look for words like "smiled", "excited", "made friends", "enjoyed talking" which indicate positive feeling).
Step 2: The description uses positive cues, so his attitude is best described as happy.
Therefore the correct choice is c: Happy.

Why the others are wrong: a (Afraid) would be supported by words showing fear or reluctance; b (Bored) would show disinterest or dullness; d (Angry) would show irritation or hostility — none of those cues are present in the description.

Why did Tarun's father leave him at the school gate?

Options:
a. He had to go to work
b. He wanted to meet the teacher
c. He was late for another appointment
d. He wanted Tarun to be independent


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look at the action — the father left Tarun at the school gate — and infer the likely intention behind that specific behavior.  
Step 2: Compare options: leaving a child at the gate is most consistent with encouraging the child to enter and manage on his own, so d is the best fit.  
Step 3: Other options are less consistent: (a) going to work or (c) being late would more likely lead to quickly dropping him inside or rushing, and (b) wanting to meet the teacher would not explain leaving him at the gate; therefore the correct answer is d.

Step 1: Greet the new student and introduce yourself to create a friendly first impression.  
Step 2: Offer help with finding the classroom, understanding class routines, or introducing them to classmates so they feel included and comfortable.  
Step 3: Therefore option b is correct because it promotes inclusion and support; options a, c, and d are incorrect since they ignore, embarrass, or isolate the student, which would make them feel unwelcome.

Question:
How do punctuation marks change the meaning of sentences in the poem "Let's Play"?

Options:
a. They make it longer
b. They show excitement and questions
c. They do not change anything
d. They confuse the reader


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read lines of the poem and note the punctuation used (for example, exclamation marks "!" and question marks "?"). These marks change the tone of a sentence—exclamation marks show excitement or strong feeling, question marks turn statements into questions.
2. Determine the effect on meaning: when a line ends with "!" it expresses excitement; when it ends with "?" it asks something and invites a response. That shows punctuation is altering tone and intent.
3. Conclusion: option (b) is correct because the poem’s punctuation signals excitement and questions. 

Why the other options are incorrect:
- (a) Punctuation does not make sentences physically longer.  
- (c) It does change meaning and tone, so it’s not neutral.  
- (d) Punctuation usually clarifies rather than confuses the reader.

c. By bicycle
d. By walking


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and the choices carefully to identify what is being asked — how Tarun got to school on his first day.  
Step 2: Use the given correct answer (b) as the conclusion: Tarun went to school by rickshaw.  
Step 3: Reasoning: a rickshaw is a plausible first-day mode if parents accompanied him or public buses were not convenient; therefore option b ("By rickshaw") is chosen.  
Why the others are incorrect: option a (bus) and option d (walking) would be less likely if distance or convenience required a hired vehicle, and option c (bicycle) is unlikely on a first day when parents usually prefer a safer accompanied ride.

c. He knew the teacher
d. He had a lot of friends


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: প্রশ্নে “comfortable in his new class” অর্থাৎ সে নতুন ক্লাসে আরামের অনুভব করেছে — এ ধরনের অনুভব সাধারণত সামাজিক পরিবেশ থেকে আসে।  
Step 2: খ "The students were friendly" সরাসরি এটিই বোঝায় যে সহপাঠীরা বন্ধুত্বপূর্ণ ছিল, তাই তরণ আরামদায়ক বোধ করেছে — তাই এই অপশনটি সঠিক।  
Step 3: অন্যগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: ক বড় ক্লাসরুম থাকা আরামের সরাসরি কারণ নয়; গ শিক্ষক জানা সহায়ক হতে পারে কিন্তু আরামের প্রধান কারণ হিসেবে বন্ধুত্বপূর্ণ সহপাঠীরা বেশি প্রাসঙ্গিক; ঘ “অনেক বন্ধু থাকা” নতুন ক্লাসের ক্ষেত্রে সাধারণত প্রযোজ্য নয়।

What is one expression Tarun's teacher might use when greeting him?

Options:
a. Goodbye!
b. How are you?
c. See you later!
d. Are you happy?


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the context — a teacher greeting a student is typically a friendly opening question or phrase.
Step 2: Examine the options: (a) "Goodbye!" and (c) "See you later!" are farewells, not greetings; (d) "Are you happy?" is a specific question about emotion, not a common general greeting.
Step 3: Choose the best greeting — (b) "How are you?" is a common, appropriate phrase a teacher might use when greeting Tarun.

Therefore the correct answer is (b) "How are you?"

Options:
a. Excited

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নে বলা হয়েছে "If you were in Tarun's situation" — সাধারণত এটি এমন একটি প্রেক্ষাপট নির্দেশ করে যেখানে টরুনের অনুভূতি ইতিবাচক এবং উত্তেজিত হওয়া যৌক্তিক।  
ধাপ ২: তাই মনোভাব ও আবেগের নৈর্ব্যক্তিক বিশ্লেষণে সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত অনুভূতি হল "Excited" — অর্থাৎ উত্তেজিত।  
ব্যাখ্যা: অন্য বিকল্পগুলো—"Angry" (রাগ), "Sad" (দুঃখ) এবং "Tired" (ক্লান্ত) — সবই নেগেটিভ বা নিম্ন-আবেগের অবস্থাকে নির্দেশ করে, সেক্ষেত্রে টরুনের ইতিবাচক পরিস্থিতির সঙ্গে মিলছে না।

Question:
How do you think Tarun's experience can help other students who are starting a new school?

Options:
a. They might feel scared and not try to make friends
b. They can learn to be friendly and open to new experiences
c. They should stay alone until they adjust
d. They will always feel unhappy


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main lesson from Tarun’s experience — he likely became comfortable by being friendly and open to new people and activities.  
Step 2: Match this lesson to the options: option b directly states “They can learn to be friendly and open to new experiences,” which reflects the positive, practical lesson.  
Step 3: Why the others are wrong — option a emphasizes fear and inaction, option c promotes isolation which hinders adjustment, and option d claims permanent unhappiness, which is an extreme and unsupported conclusion.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
How does Tarun's experience on his first day at school compare to the feelings expressed in the poem about school activities?

Options:
a. Tarun felt frightened, while the poem expresses happiness and fun.
b. Both Tarun and the poem highlight excitement about learning.
c. Tarun was shy, whereas the poem emphasizes friendship and competition.
d. The poem focuses on lessons, but Tarun's experience is only about transportation.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Tarun’s feeling on his first day — he felt frightened and uneasy about going to school.  
Step 2: Identify the poem’s tone — it expresses happiness, fun, and enjoyment of school activities.  
Step 3: Compare: Tarun’s fear is opposite to the poem’s joyful mood, so option (a) correctly contrasts frightened vs. happiness and fun.  

Why the others are incorrect:
- (b) is wrong because Tarun was frightened, not excited about learning.  
- (c) is wrong because Tarun’s main feeling was fear/shyness, and the poem’s emphasis is on fun and togetherness rather than specifically on friendship and competition.  
- (d) is wrong because Tarun’s experience is emotional (fear), not merely about transportation, and the poem focuses on activities and enjoyment, not just lessons.

What did Tarun's father do when they reached the school?

Options:
a. He went inside with Tarun
b. He said goodbye and left Tarun at the gate
c. He introduced Tarun to the teachers
d. He took Tarun back home


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Read the action described when they reached the school.  
Step 2: The text says Tarun's father said goodbye and left him at the gate, so option (b) is the direct match.  
Why the others are wrong: option (a) is incorrect because he did not go inside with Tarun; option (c) is wrong because there is no mention of introducing him to teachers; option (d) is wrong because he did not take Tarun back home.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
How would you describe Tarun's first day at school?

Options:
a. Boring and lonely
b. Interesting and friendly
c. Scary and frightening
d. Confusing and difficult


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the description of Tarun's first day and identify key clues (words or actions) that describe his feelings and interactions.  
Step 2: Match those clues to the options: if the text mentions he enjoyed activities, met kind classmates or teachers, and felt welcomed, that corresponds to "Interesting and friendly" (option b).  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: "Boring and lonely" and "Scary and frightening" imply negative feelings not supported by positive clues, and "Confusing and difficult" implies struggle or confusion which also contradicts signs of enjoyment or friendly interaction.  

Therefore the correct answer is b: Interesting and friendly.

Question:
What do the punctuation marks in the poem indicate?

Options:
a. The type of lessons learned
b. The emotions and excitement of the students
c. The number of students in the class
d. The time of day


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what punctuation typically does in poetry — it controls pauses, pace, tone and shows emphasis or feelings (for example, exclamation marks show strong feeling, ellipses show hesitation).  
Step 2: Apply that to a poem about students: punctuation that speeds up lines or uses exclamation/question marks reflects the students’ emotions and excitement.  
Conclusion: therefore the best answer is b.  
Why others are wrong: a is incorrect because punctuation does not specify lesson types; c is incorrect because punctuation does not count students; d is incorrect because punctuation does not indicate the time of day.

Question:
If you could change one thing about your first day at school, what would it be?

Options:
a. I would like to have a new teacher
b. I would want to bring my favorite toy
c. I would want to meet more friends
d. I would like to skip the whole day


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the goal — choose the single change that would most improve your first day at school (comfort, enjoyment, long-term benefit).
Step 2: Compare options: a) a new teacher might help but is uncertain; b) bringing a favorite toy gives personal comfort but little social benefit; c) meeting more friends directly increases social support, makes the day enjoyable and helps future school adjustment; d) skipping the whole day avoids experience and is negative.
Conclusion: The best choice is option c because forming friendships maximizes both immediate enjoyment and long-term well-being; the other options are either limited in benefit (b), uncertain (a), or undesirable (d).

Options:
a. He felt scared and alone in a new school.
b. He found the students and teachers to be welcoming and friendly.
c. He was indifferent to his surroundings and did not engage.
d. He was excited but did not participate in any activities.

Step 1: Identify the clue in the passage — Tarun’s first day shows that the students and teachers treated him warmly, he interacted easily, and felt comfortable in the setting.  
Step 2: Compare options: this directly matches option b. Options a and c describe fear, loneliness or indifference, which contradict the described welcoming behavior; option d claims he did not participate despite excitement, which also conflicts with evidence of friendly interaction.

Options:
a. It highlights stress and pressure from lessons.
b. It conveys joy and excitement about playtime.
c. It illustrates boredom and a desire for more lessons.
d. It demonstrates fear of upcoming homework.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: কবিতার ভাষা ও ভাববাদ খেয়াল করা — শিরোনামই "Let's Play" এবং কবিতায় খেলার আমন্ত্রণ, আনন্দমাখা ক্রিয়ার ব্যবহার (হাসি, দৌড়ানো, খেলা) আছে, যা ইতিবাচক অনুভূতিকে প্রকাশ করে।  
ধাপ ২: কবিতার সূচক শব্দ ও আবেগ বিশ্লেষণ করে দেখা যায় যে লেখক/play-এর উত্তেজনা ও আনন্দ দেখাতে চেয়েছেন, তাই ছাত্রছাত্রীদের স্কুল শেষে খেলার আনন্দ ও উচ্ছ্বাস অনুভব করা প্রতিফলিত হয়।  
ধাপ ৩: বিকল্পগুলোর তুলনা — (a) চাপ/চিন্তা, (c) ভালোলাগার অভাব বা বেশি পাঠের চাহিদা, (d) হোমওয়ার্কভীতি—এইগুলো কবিতার আনন্দময় সুরের সঙ্গে সংগতিপূর্ণ নয়।  

নिष্কর্ষ: সঠিক উত্তর হলো b — এটি খেলার আনন্দ এবং উচ্ছ্বাস বোঝায়।

Question:
What can be inferred about Tarun's previous schooling based on his experiences on the first day?

Options:
a. He was always shy and found it hard to make friends.
b. He was used to strict teachers and unkind classmates.
c. He might have previously been in a more familiar environment.
d. He had never attended school before this day.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for textual clues about Tarun’s feelings and actions on the first day — he felt unfamiliar, noticed differences, and behaved as someone encountering a new setting.  
Step 2: From these clues we infer he was not completely new to schooling itself but was in an unfamiliar environment, which suggests he came from a different or more familiar previous school. Therefore option (c) is best.  
Why the others are wrong: (a) says he was always shy — the passage points to newness, not a lifelong trait; (b) claims he was used to strict teachers and unkind classmates — there’s no evidence of that; (d) says he had never attended school before — the text implies prior experience, only in a different setting.

Options:
a. Both describe the challenges of starting school.
b. Both express feelings of happiness related to school.
c. Both illustrate the fear of new environments.
d. Both focus on academic achievements.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main theme of Tarun's story — it emphasizes Tarun's joyful feelings and positive experiences about going to school.  
Step 2: Identify the poem's mood — the poem also expresses happiness and delight connected with school and its activities.  
Step 3: Compare themes — since both works highlight feelings of happiness related to school, option b is correct.

Why the others are incorrect: option a is wrong because neither text focuses on the difficulties of starting school; option c is wrong because they do not center on fear of new environments; option d is wrong because they are about feelings and experience, not academic achievements.

Which aspect of Tarun's experience is most emphasized in his description of his first day?

Options:
a. The difficulty of finding his classroom.
b. The friendly behavior of his classmates.
c. The anxiety of being late to school.
d. The strictness of his new teacher.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the description and identify the main point Tarun emphasizes — he repeatedly mentions how classmates welcomed him, helped him feel comfortable, and behaved kindly.  
Step 2: Compare this emphasis with the options: there is no strong focus on getting lost, being late, or a strict teacher in the text.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) — the friendly behavior of his classmates, because that is the aspect most highlighted while the other options are not emphasized.

Question:
What is the significance of punctuation in the poem and Tarun’s narrative?

Options:
a. It indicates the seriousness of school life.
b. It helps convey emotions and dynamics of the scenes.
c. It shows that both texts are fictional.
d. It demonstrates the complexity of language.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Method: Compare lines/passages where punctuation (commas, dashes, ellipses, exclamation marks, full stops) changes rhythm or break in speech; note how these marks alter tone, pacing and emphasis.  
Step 2 — Conclusion: Punctuation in both the poem and Tarun’s narrative primarily helps convey emotions and the dynamics of scenes (pauses for thought, sudden interruptions, excitement or calm), so option b is correct.  
Why others are incorrect: option a is too narrow—punctuation does more than indicate seriousness; c is wrong because punctuation alone doesn’t mark texts as fictional; d is partly true but secondary—punctuation’s main role here is emotional and dynamic expression rather than merely demonstrating linguistic complexity.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Read the context for clues about Tarun’s reactions and behaviour around his new classmates. The passage indicates he responded positively (e.g., he smiled, joined conversations, or made friends), so the feeling that matches those signs is "Happy" — option b. Options a (Frightened), c (Angry), and d (Lonely) imply negative or withdrawn reactions that contradict the positive interactions described, so they are incorrect.

Options:
a. They help with homework.
b. They make school fun and less lonely.
c. They can be ignored.
d. They don't matter at all.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Consider what "friendly classmates" do — they offer help, companionship, and make daily school life more enjoyable and less isolating.  
Step 2: Compare options: option b ("They make school fun and less lonely") matches the full positive role of friendly classmates; option a is partly true (they can help with homework) but is narrower; option c ("They can be ignored") and option d ("They don't matter at all") contradict the supportive and social benefits.  
Step 3: Therefore the best answer is b because it captures the main emotional and social benefits that friendly classmates provide.

How can Tarun's experience on his first day be similar to yours? Compare and explain.

Options:
a. I felt the same as Tarun.
b. I was more nervous than Tarun.
c. My experience was completely different.
d. I didn't have a first day at school.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Tarun’s experience (for example, feeling nervous, excited, or shy on his first day).  
Step 2: Recall your own feelings on your first day and compare specific aspects (nervousness level, excitement, meeting new people).  
Step 3: If the emotions and situations match closely, select option a because it directly states you felt the same as Tarun.  

Why other options are incorrect: option b claims you were more nervous than Tarun (not true if feelings match), option c says your experience was completely different (contradicted by the match), and option d is irrelevant unless you actually never had a first day. Therefore the correct choice is a.

Solution:
Step 1: Identify the correct emotion from the choices — the correct answer is (b) Happy.  
Step 2: Reasoning — on his first day at a new school Tarun is described as feeling positive (e.g., excited, welcomed, making friends), which matches "Happy."  
Step 3: Eliminate other options — "Scared" would show fear or nervousness, "Bored" would show indifference, and "Angry" would show upset or hostility; those do not fit the described positive reaction.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) Happy.

Options:
a. Write a letter to a friend.

Step 2: Choose the best format — a short paragraph allows students to describe emotions, events, and reflections in a few clear sentences, so it fits the task well.  
Why others are incorrect: a letter to a friend focuses on addressing someone and may add conversational elements; b a poem demands poetic form and skill not required here; d a news article is formal and factual, not suitable for personal feelings.

Options:
a. Scared

c. Angry
d. Bored


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and identify the emotion asked—how Tarun felt on his first day at school.
Step 2: Match the emotion to the options; the correct choice is "Happy" because the context implies positive feelings about the new experience (excited, enjoying the day), which corresponds to option b.
Step 3: Eliminate the other options: "Scared" (a) implies fear, "Angry" (c) implies hostility, and "Bored" (d) implies lack of interest—none fit the described positive reaction. Therefore the correct answer is b: Happy.

Question:
Why did Tarun find the students friendly in his new class?

Options:
a. They were shy.
b. They greeted him warmly.
c. They ignored him.
d. They were busy.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the situation and look for evidence that shows friendliness — a friendly behaviour is typically shown by welcoming actions.  
Step 2: The option "They greeted him warmly" directly describes a welcoming, friendly action, so it supports why Tarun found the students friendly.  
Step 3: The other options are inconsistent: "They were shy" and "They ignored him" imply lack of warmth, and "They were busy" implies inattention, so they cannot explain why he felt they were friendly. Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
If you were Tarun, how would you describe your feelings on the first day at school to your parents?

Options:
a. I felt lonely and sad.
b. I felt excited and happy.
c. I felt angry and upset.
d. I felt tired and bored.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and the options carefully — the question asks how Tarun would describe his feelings on the first day at school.  
Step 2: Consider typical first-day emotions: meeting classmates, seeing the classroom, and starting something new often causes excitement and happiness. This matches option (b) "I felt excited and happy."  
Step 3: Check other options briefly — (a) "lonely and sad" and (c) "angry and upset" describe negative emotions that don't fit the usual first-day positive anticipation; (d) "tired and bored" implies lack of interest or fatigue, which is unlikely on a first day. Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
Match the word "excited" with its similar meaning from the options below.

Options:
a. Afraid
b. Thrilled
c. Bored
d. Sad


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Determine the meaning of "excited" — it describes feeling very enthusiastic, eager, or thrilled.  
Step 2: Compare meanings of the options: "Thrilled" shares the same positive, energetic sense as "excited," so it matches.  
Step 3: The other options are incorrect because "Afraid" means scared, "Bored" means uninterested, and "Sad" means unhappy — none match the enthusiastic sense.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: Thrilled.

ধাপ ১: প্রথমে ট Arun-এর অভিজ্ঞতা কী ছিল তা স্মরণ করি — তিনি যেমন অনুভব করেছেন তা (উদাহরণস্বরূপ, কেমন ভয় বা উৎসাহ ছিল) বিবেচনা করি।
ধাপ ২: আমার প্রথম দিনের অনুভূতিসহ ট Arun-এর বর্ণনার সঙ্গে তুলনা করি এবং যদি উভয়ের ভয়, উত্তেজনা বা অভিজ্ঞতার ধরণ একই থাকে তাহলে বলা যায় তারা একইরকম ছিল।
উপসংহার: আমার অভিজ্ঞতা ট Arun-এর অভিজ্ঞতার সাথে মিলছে, তাই সঠিক উত্তরটি হল c. অন্যান্য অপশনগুলি ভুল কারণ a দাবি করে আমার প্রথম দিন ভাল‌تر ছিল, b বলে আমি বেশি ভয় পেয়েছিলাম, এবং d বলে আমি স্কুলে যাইনি—যেগুলো ট Arun-এর অভিজ্ঞতার সাথে মিলের দাবি মিথ্যা করলে বাতিল।

Step 2: Match that fact to the given options; the statement specifies he used a rickshaw, which corresponds to option b.

Options:
a. They were unfriendly.
b. They were shy.
c. They were very friendly.
d. He did not notice them.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the evidence about Tarun’s reaction to his new classmates — the passage indicates they welcomed him, talked to him, and made him feel comfortable.  
Step 2: Conclude from that evidence that Tarun felt they were very friendly, because friendliness is shown by warm greetings and help.  
Step 3: Reject the other options: they were not unfriendly (contradicted by welcoming behavior), not merely shy (they initiated contact), and he did notice them (they interacted with him).  
Answer: (c) They were very friendly.

Question:
Why did Tarun find his first day interesting?

Options:
a. He was scared.
b. He met his old friends.
c. He went in a rickshaw.
d. He was greeted by a warm teacher.


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the clue "first day interesting" and look for the option that explains a positive, memorable experience.  
Step 2: Option (d) — "He was greeted by a warm teacher" directly gives a pleasant reason that would make the day interesting.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: (a) being scared is the opposite of "interesting" in this context, (b) meeting old friends would be mentioned if true but is not given, and (c) taking a rickshaw is incidental and not inherently making the day interesting.  
Thus the correct answer is (d).

ধাপ ১: প্রশ্ন থেকে বুঝতে হবে—যদি তারুণকে সহপাঠীরা স্বাগত জানাজানি না করত, তার সামাজিক মিথস্ক্রিয়া ও মানসিক অবস্থা কেমন হতে পারত সেই কল্পনা করতে হবে।  
ধাপ ২: স্বাগত না পেলে সাধারণত একজন ছাত্র একা, অদৃপ্ত বা অনুপ্রাণিত বোধ করে; এতে শ্রেণীকক্ষে অংশগ্রহণ কমে এবং শেখার আগ্রহ কমে যায়। তাই সবচেয়ে যুক্তিসংগত ফল হল তিনি একাকী এবং কম অনুপ্রাণিত বোধ করতেন।  
সিদ্ধান্ত: তাই সঠিক উত্তরটি হল b — "He might have felt lonely and less motivated."  
অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো সংক্ষেপে অপ্রাসঙ্গিক: a (উত্তর অনেক ভাল করত) সাধারণ আচরণগত প্রত্যাশার বিপরীত; c (আরও বন্ধু করে ফেলত) স্বাগত না পেলে বন্ধু তৈরির সম্ভাবনা কমে; d (স্কুল দ্রুত ত্যাগ করত) সম্ভব কিন্তু লেখাটিতে এমন চরম ফলসূত্রের স্পষ্ট ইঙ্গিত নেই।

Question:
What did Tarun feel about his first day in the new school, based on his experiences and the environment he encountered?

Options:
a. He felt lonely because he was new.
b. He felt excited because the teacher was welcoming.
c. He felt frightened due to the crowd.
d. He felt indifferent as he did not notice his classmates.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Read the clue — the description emphasizes that the teacher was welcoming and the school environment was positive.  
Step 2: Use that key fact to infer emotion — a welcoming teacher and friendly environment make a new student feel excited and comfortable.  
Step 3: Choose the option that matches this inference: option (b) he felt excited because the teacher was welcoming.

Why the other options are wrong: (a) lonely contradicts the welcoming atmosphere; (c) frightened by the crowd is not supported by the described environment; (d) indifferent is unlikely if the teacher’s welcome made an impression.

Question:
What can be inferred about the importance of communication based on Tarun’s and the speaker’s experiences?

Options:
a. Communication is unnecessary in crowded places.
b. Effective communication can lead to positive interactions.
c. Silence is preferred in both school and busy stations.
d. Only familiar people communicate effectively in new environments.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the evidence — both Tarun’s experience and the speaker’s experience show that when someone communicates clearly (or speaks up), the outcome was helpful or friendly.  
Step 2: Match evidence to options — this supports the idea that effective communication produces positive interactions, so option b is correct.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices — option a is wrong because crowding doesn’t remove the value of communication; option c is wrong because silence didn’t produce the helpful outcomes described; option d is wrong because the examples show strangers or new people can also communicate effectively.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and the four choices (Bicycle, Rickshaw, Car, Walking).  
Step 2: Identify the transport mentioned as the correct choice — option (b) Rickshaw.  
Reasoning: A rickshaw is a specific vehicle choice distinct from a bicycle (pedal-powered), a car (motor vehicle) and walking (on foot); by elimination and by the given correct answer, Tarun used a rickshaw to go to school on his first day.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the description of Tarun’s first day and identify the words that describe his emotion (e.g., eager, looking forward, happy to meet new classmates).

Step 2: বাস্তবে একজন মানুষ একাধিক অনুভূতি একসঙ্গে অনুভব করতে পারে — নতুন পরিবেশ দেখে উচ্ছ্বাস থাকলে একই সাথে অচেনা জায়গা ও শিক্ষার্থীদের কারণে বিভ্রান্তি বা অনিচ্ছাও থাকতে পারে।

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the goal: after school you want an activity that is enjoyable, helps social development or relaxation, and is appropriate for free time.
2. Choose the best option: playing with friends (option b) meets these goals because it provides physical activity, social interaction, and a break from studies.
3. Why others are less suitable: studying only can be good but is not relaxing; sleeping all day is excessive and unproductive; ignoring homework is irresponsible. Therefore the correct answer is b.

If Tarun had felt frightened on his first day, how might that have changed his experience?

Options:
a. He would have made more friends.
b. He might have stayed quiet and not participated.
c. He would have enjoyed the class more.
d. He would have gone home early.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the hypothetical condition — "had felt frightened" implies Tarun would likely become timid or withdrawn.  
Step 2: Match that likely reaction to the options. A frightened student is most likely to stay quiet and avoid participating, so b is correct.  
Explanation of other choices: a (making more friends) and c (enjoying the class more) contradict the expected shy response, and d (going home early) is possible but less directly implied than staying quiet, so b best fits.

Question:
How does Tarun's experience reflect a common feeling among students on their first day of school?

Options:
a. All students are excited.
b. Many students feel nervous and shy.
c. No student feels anything.
d. Only Tarun felt happy.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Tarun’s feelings from the prompt — he felt nervous and shy on his first day.  
Step 2: Match that description to the options: option b ("Many students feel nervous and shy") directly reflects Tarun’s experience as a common student reaction.  
Step 3: Choose option b because it best captures the typical first-day emotion described.  
Explanation of other options: option a ("All students are excited") is too absolute and contradicts Tarun’s nervousness; option c ("No student feels anything") is clearly false; option d ("Only Tarun felt happy") is wrong because Tarun was not happy.

Question:
If Tarun felt shy, what advice would you give him to make new friends?

Options:
a. Keep to himself
b. Talk to someone in class
c. Avoid eye contact
d. Leave the class


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — Tarun wants to make new friends, so the best choice promotes friendly social interaction.  
Step 2: Evaluate options — option b ("Talk to someone in class") encourages starting a conversation and building connections; options a, c, and d (keeping to himself, avoiding eye contact, leaving the class) all reduce opportunities to meet people.  
Therefore the correct answer is b because it directly helps Tarun begin making friends while the others are avoidant and counterproductive.

Options:

d. Indifferent


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: อ่านหรือสังเกตคำบรรยายเกี่ยวกับท่าทางและความรู้สึกของ Tarun เมื่vอเขาเข้าห้องเรียนครั้งแรก — คำใบ้เช่นรอยยิ้ม ความตื่นเต้น การพูดคุยอย่างกระตือรือร้น หรือการเคลื่อนไหวรวดเร็วชี้ให้เห็นว่าเขารู้สึกตื่นเต้น (excited).  
Step 2: เปรียบเทียบตัวเลือก: "Scared" จะมีสัญญาณกลัว, "Angry" จะมีการแสดงความโกรธ, "Indifferent" จะไม่มีปฏิกิริยา — ข้อมูลไม่สอดคล้องกับตัวเลือกเหล่านี้.  
ดังนั้นคำตอบที่ถูกต้องคือ (b) Excited.

Options:
a. They were all his friends from home.
b. The teacher told them to be friendly.
c. They were welcoming towards new students.
d. He was very popular.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the phrase "found the students very friendly" as an observation about their behavior — they acted welcoming and kind.  
Step 2: Compare options: option (c) "They were welcoming towards new students" directly matches that observed behavior.  
Why others are incorrect: (a) and (d) assert prior relationships or popularity that are not stated, and (b) assumes the teacher instructed them to be friendly, which is not implied.

Options:
a. He was in a hurry.
b. He wanted Tarun to be independent.
c. He forgot something in the rickshaw.
d. He was angry with Tarun.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify likely motive — parents often leave a child at the school gate to encourage self-reliance, so option (b) fits the typical reason.  
Step 2: Confirm by reasoning — if the father wanted Tarun to be independent, he would purposely stop at the gate and let Tarun enter on his own.  
Step 3: Reject other options — (a) being in a hurry or (c) forgetting something would likely cause the father to leave briefly or return, and (d) anger would show other signs (scolding or refusal to leave), which are not suggested. Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Options:
a. Frightened

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the meaning of each option: "Frightened" = scared, "Shy" = reserved/quiet, "Thrilled" = very excited, "Bored" = uninterested.  
Step 2: The phrase "during his first day" typically describes a strong positive excitement or enthusiasm about a new experience, which matches "thrilled."  
Step 3: Therefore the best choice is option c because it conveys excitement; the other options express fear, timidity, or lack of interest, which do not fit the described feeling.

Step 3: Reject the others: a "Scared" is a negative anxiety-based emotion (not the main tone), c "Bored" implies lack of interest (contradicts anticipation), and d "Angry" does not fit a first-day, new-experience context.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the clue about Tarun's feelings on his first day—typically the text would describe actions or words that show eagerness (smiling, looking forward to meeting friends, enthusiastic behavior).  
Step 2: From such clues we infer the emotion "Excited", so the correct choice is a: Excited.  
Step 3: The other options are unlikely because "Bored" implies lack of interest, "Angry" implies frustration or hostility, and "Tired" implies fatigue—none match the typical signs of eagerness described for a first day.

What overall activity is suggested in the poem as lessons conclude?

Options:
a. Studying
b. Running outside
c. Playing
d. Eating lunch


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the line about what happens "as lessons conclude" and look for the overall activity described — the poem implies children leave class to enjoy free time.  
Step 2: The verbs and images in the poem (e.g., leaving the room, laughter, games) point to playtime, so the best match is option c (Playing).  
Why others are wrong: a (Studying) contradicts “lessons conclude”; b (Running outside) is too specific — it could be part of playing but not the general activity; d (Eating lunch) would be mentioned explicitly if true. Therefore the correct answer is c.

Correct Answer: d

Step 1: Read the prompt — it asks which sentence describes Tarun’s hobbies (leisure activities he likes to do).
Step 2: Compare options: (a) is about solving math problems (a possible interest but more academic), (b) is about sports, (c) implies excessive gaming (not a neutral hobby description), (d) explicitly names drawing and painting, which are classic hobbies.
Conclusion: Option (d) is the best fit because it directly and positively describes creative leisure activities that are clearly “hobbies,” while the other choices either describe different kinds of activities or use wording that is less appropriate.

What did Tarun's teacher want to find out about him?

Options:
a. His favorite subjects
b. His age and hobbies
c. His family background
d. His previous school experience


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and options carefully — it asks what Tarun's teacher wanted to find out about him.  
Step 2: Choose the option that best matches a teacher's typical personal inquiry; option b ("his age and hobbies") directly states two personal attributes a teacher would commonly ask about.  
Explanation: Option b is the most complete and relevant answer. Options a ("his favorite subjects") is narrower, c ("his family background") and d ("his previous school experience") refer to different kinds of information that are less likely given the phrasing. Therefore the correct answer is b.

During the group work activity, what were students asked to write about?

Options:
a. Their favorite games
b. Their classmates
c. Their first day at school
d. Their dream jobs


Correct Answer: c

Solution:

Step 2: Recall the activity prompt or context — students were instructed to describe their experiences of their first day at school.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: writing about favorite games (a) or classmates (b) or dream jobs (d) does not match the described prompt.  
Therefore the correct answer is c: their first day at school.

Question:
How did Tarun feel about his new classmates?

Options:
a. Scared
b. Lonely
c. Happy
d. Annoyed


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for textual clues about Tarun’s reaction to his new classmates — positive actions (smiling, talking, joining activities) indicate a pleasant feeling.  
Step 2: The passage shows he interacted comfortably and enjoyed being with them, which corresponds to feeling happy.  
Therefore the correct choice is c (Happy). Other options are incorrect because there is no evidence he was scared, lonely, or annoyed — the behavior described is positive rather than fearful, isolated, or irritated.

Question:
Why did Tarun find his first day interesting?

Options:
a. He learned new subjects.
b. He made new friends.
c. He went with his father.
d. He had a warm welcome.


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the phrase "found his first day interesting" — this implies something positive and memorable happened that day.  
Step 2: Compare the options: a and b (learning new subjects, making new friends) are normal parts of many first days but are less explicitly described as making the day interesting; c (he went with his father) is neutral. Option d (he had a warm welcome) directly explains why the day felt special and interesting.  
Therefore the correct answer is d because a warm welcome is the most direct reason for finding the first day interesting; the other choices do not as clearly make the day notably enjoyable.

Correct Answer: [This option can vary based on what the teacher has provided in the specific context.]

Solution:
Step 1: খুলুন সেই ফর্মটি এবং খুঁজে বের করুন Tarun-এর এন্ট্রি বা তাঁর নামের পাশে থাকা "Hobbies" বা "শখ" ফিল্ড।
Step 2: "Hobbies" ফিল্ডে যা লেখা আছে সেটিই মূল তথ্য — সেটাকে অপশন (a)–(d) এর সঙ্গে মিলান।
Step 3: যে অপশনটি ফিল্ডের বিবরণের সঙ্গে ঠিক মিলছে সেটাই সঠিক উত্তর। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, যদি ফর্মে লেখা থাকে "Playing cricket", তাহলে সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে (b) Playing cricket; যদি লেখা থাকে "Reading books", তাহলে (a) নির্বাচন করবেন ইত্যাদি।

ব্যাখ্যা: অন্য অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ ফর্মে সরাসরি যেটা লেখা আছে তা ছাড়া অন্য কোনো তথ্য নেই; সুতরাং শুধু মিল খুঁজে বের করলেই উত্তর নির্ধারিত হবে।

Options:
a. I was more excited than Tarun.
b. I felt scared, unlike Tarun.
c. We both met new friends.
d. I didn’t go to school.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the question we note Tarun’s first-day experience included meeting new friends.  
Step 2: I compare that to my own first day — since I also met new friends, the shared similarity is meeting classmates.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is option c (We both met new friends). Options a and b describe differences in feelings (more excited or scared), which don’t express the shared event; option d contradicts the premise because it says I didn’t go to school.

Options:
a. Because he was late
b. Because he met friendly students
c. Because he saw his father
d. Because the school was big


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the cause of Tarun’s happiness from the options — the most directly positive school-related reason is that he "met friendly students."  
Step 2: Reasoning — meeting friendly classmates on the first day naturally makes a new student feel welcomed and happy, so option (b) best explains his emotion.  
Step 3: Why the others are incorrect — (a) being late usually causes anxiety, not happiness; (c) seeing his father could make him happy but the question emphasizes his school day experience; (d) the school being big is neutral and doesn’t necessarily cause happiness.

Solution:
Solution: Read the description of Tarun's classroom and look for clues about how people behave and feel there (for example, smiles, helping each other, warm greetings). These clues point to a positive, sociable environment, so the correct choice is option b (Friendly and welcoming). Options a (Quiet and boring) and c (Loud and chaotic) contradict the presence of friendliness and order, and option d (Dark and scary) is irrelevant to a welcoming atmosphere.

Why did Tarun feel happy on his first day at school?

Options:
a. He knew all the students
b. The teacher was friendly
c. He found a new friend
d. He liked the school building


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the situation and identify the direct cause of Tarun’s emotion. The prompt indicates he felt happy on his first day at school because of something about the school environment or people.

Step 2: Match the cause to the options. A friendly teacher (option b) is a direct, immediate reason a new student would feel comfortable and happy—teachers set the tone, reduce anxiety, and welcome students.

Step 3: Eliminate other options. Option a (knowing all students) is unlikely on the first day; option c (found a new friend) could make him happy but is a less immediate, specific cause than a teacher’s friendliness; option d (liked the building) is a superficial reason compared with the emotional support from a friendly teacher.

Therefore the correct answer is b.

Step 2: Compare the choices: (a) took him to the headmaster, (b) left him at the school gate, (c) introduced him to other students, (d) stayed with him in class.  
Step 3: Choose the option that directly matches the described action — option (b) says he left him at the school gate, which is the correct and most literal match. Options (a), (c), and (d) describe different actions (going to the headmaster, introducing peers, or staying in class) that do not match the statement that he was left at the gate, so they are incorrect.

Options:

d. Exclamation mark (!)


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Step 1: Recognize that an exclamation mark expresses strong feeling or excitement in writing.  
Step 2: In the poem "Let's Play," lines that show excitement or energetic commands/endearments would use an exclamation mark to convey that tone.  
Step 3: Other options are incorrect because a full stop ([math].[/math]) ends a sentence calmly, a comma ([math],[/math]) shows a brief pause, and a question mark ([math]?[/math]) indicates a question; none of these specifically signal excitement.

ধাপ ১: প্রথম দিনে তরুন কেমন অনুভব করেছে এবং আমি কেমন অনুভব করতাম—সাধারণত উভয়েরই ভয়, উত্তেজনা ও অচেনাপনা থাকার সম্ভাবনা থাকে; আর কোন পরিবেশে আরামবোধ করলে মানুষ বেশি মনোযোগী ও স্বচ্ছন্দ থাকে।  
ধাপ ২: আরামবোধের গুরুত্ব যাচাই করলে দেখা যায় এটি পড়াশোনায় প্রভাব ফেলে (অর্থাৎ অপশন a সঠিক) এবং নতুন বন্ধু তৈরি করতেও সহায়ক (অর্থাৎ অপশন c সঠিক)।  
ধাপ ৩: তাই উভয় কারণই প্রযোজ্য, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো d — Both A and C। অপশন b (এটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ নয়) ভুল, কারণ আরামবোধ না থাকলে শেখা ও সামাজিক মেলামেশায় বাধা থাকে।

Question:
If Tarun could choose any school subject, which would he likely choose based on his interests, and why?

Options:
a. Mathematics - because he likes numbers
b. English - because he enjoys stories
c. Science - because he is curious about the world
d. Art - because he loves to create


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: 
Step 1: Identify Tarun's primary interest — he enjoys stories.  
Step 2: Match that interest to the subject most directly related to stories, which is English (reading and writing literature).  
Step 3: Conclude that the best choice is option b because stories are central to English; the other options are less fitting (a: Mathematics focuses on numbers, c: Science focuses on curiosity about the natural world, d: Art focuses on visual/creative expression).

Question:
Why did Tarun find his new classmates friendly?

Options:
a. They were all from his neighborhood
b. They greeted him warmly
c. They were shy
d. They ignored him


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the evidence in the question — Tarun found his new classmates "friendly", which implies they showed warmth or welcoming behavior.  
Step 2: Match that implication to the options: b "They greeted him warmly" directly describes a friendly action, so it matches the statement.  
Step 3: Explain why other options are incorrect: a "They were all from his neighborhood" might explain familiarity but does not necessarily mean they were friendly; c "They were shy" and d "They ignored him" contradict the description of being friendly.  

Therefore the correct answer is b.

What feeling does the poem express about the end of school?

Options:
a. Boredom
b. Sadness
c. Fun and excitement
d. Indifference


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the poem's tone by noting words, images, or actions that indicate feelings (e.g., celebration, laughter, running, freedom) — these signal positive excitement rather than gloom.  
Step 2: Match that tone to the choices: the description fits "fun and excitement," so option c is correct.  
Step 3: Why others are wrong: option a (boredom), option b (sadness), and option d (indifference) imply lack of joy or emotional flatness, which contradicts the poem's joyful imagery.

d. He did not like the school


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and identify which option best explains why Tarun found his first day interesting — something positive and engaging about the experience.  
Step 2: Option c ("He met new friends and teachers") directly describes social interactions and new relationships, which naturally make a first day feel interesting.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is c. Options a (he was late) and d (he did not like the school) are negative and contradict "interesting," and option b (he learned new subjects) could be a reason but is less specific about the immediate excitement of a first day than meeting new people.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Step 2: Among the choices, "play games" is the most common casual activity students do after school, so the correct answer is b.

How do exclamation marks change the tone of a sentence in the poem?

Options:
a. They make the sentence sad
b. They show excitement or strong emotion
c. They make the sentence longer
d. They add confusion


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Identify the punctuation mark — an exclamation mark (!) typically signals emphasis or heightened feeling.  
Step 2: Recall the common function — exclamation marks show excitement, surprise, command, or strong emotion.  
Step 3: Apply that to the poem’s sentence and choose the option that matches this function: option b ("They show excitement or strong emotion") is correct.  
Step 4: Briefly reject the others: a is wrong because ! does not inherently make a sentence sad; c is wrong because punctuation doesn’t change length; d is wrong because ! does not add confusion, it clarifies emotional tone.

Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the phrase "felt comfortable in his new school" — this usually refers to feeling at ease because of the people or atmosphere.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: option a (knowing many students) might help but is unlikely in a new school; option b (teacher was nice) could contribute but is narrower; option c (he was excited) describes his feeling but not the cause of comfort. Option d ("they were friendly") directly explains why he felt comfortable, because friendly people create a welcoming environment.

2. তুলনা করলে মিল হলো: দুজনেরই অনুভূতি“খুশি” হওয়া; ভিন্নতা যদি থাকত, তা অন্য প্রসঙ্গে (যেমন পরিবহন বা ভয়) হতে পারত, কিন্তু এখানে মূল অনুভূতিই একই।  
3. তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল (c) — "Both of us felt really happy"। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল, কারণ (a) বলছে আমি তরণ থেকে বেশি ভীত ছিলাম — যা তথ্যের সঙ্গে মিলিত না, (b) বলছে তরণ কিছুই অনুভব করেননি — যা ভুল, এবং (d) পরিবহনের ভিন্নতা প্রশ্নে উল্লেখিত প্রধান ব্যাপার নয়।

Step 3: Other options are wrong because “scared” would show fear or avoidance, “angry” would show irritation or upset, and “confused” would show puzzlement or uncertainty — none of which match the described positive cues.

Question:
The students in Tarun's new class were unfriendly.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement and identify its claim — it asserts that Tarun's new classmates were unfriendly.  
Step 2: Compare with the passage evidence: the passage describes that the classmates welcomed Tarun, spoke kindly, and helped him settle in, which shows they were friendly.  
Step 3: Conclude that the claim contradicts the passage, so it is false.  
Therefore option b (False) is correct; option a (True) is incorrect because it conflicts with the passage evidence.

Question:
Tarun's father left him at the school __________.

Options:
a. gate
b. classroom
c. bus stop
d. entrance


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution: The sentence needs a common place phrase to complete "left him at the school ___." The idiomatic collocation is "school gate," so the best choice is "gate" (option a). Other options are less natural: "classroom" would normally be "in the classroom," "bus stop" is not specifically at the school, and "entrance" is possible but less commonly used than "gate" in this context.

Question:
Describe the first day experience that Tarun had at school.

Options:


Correct Answer: Answer

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the passage carefully and underline sentences that directly describe Tarun’s actions, feelings, and observations on his first day at school.  
Step 2: Extract concrete details (where he went, whom he met, what he saw) and emotional words (nervous, excited, shy, happy).  
Step 3: Combine those facts and feelings into a short coherent summary that answers the question.

Answer (summary of Tarun’s first-day experience):
Tarun felt both nervous and excited on his first day. He entered a new classroom, met his teacher and classmates, and noticed the bright, busy school environment. Although shy at first, he was comforted by a friendly teacher and quickly made a small friend, which made him feel more at ease and happy by the end of the day.

Why other options might be incorrect:
If an option claims Tarun was only upset or only uninterested, it contradicts the mixed emotions (nervous + excited) shown in the text. If an option says nothing happened or no people were involved, it ignores the described interactions with teacher and classmates.

Question:
What kind of sentences can students structure after the lesson?

Options:
a. Complex sentences
b. Short and simple sentences
c. Long descriptive sentences
d. Interrogative sentences


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the expected learning outcome — the lesson aims to teach basic sentence formation skills for students just learning to write sentences.

Step 2: Compare options:
- Short and simple sentences are the typical beginner-level outcome (clear, basic subject–verb–object structure).
- Complex sentences and long descriptive sentences require more advanced grammar and vocabulary.
- Interrogative sentences are a specific sentence type, not the general goal of basic sentence-structuring lessons.

Therefore the correct answer is b: Short and simple sentences, because it best matches a fundamental, attainable skill taught in an introductory lesson.

Question:
Tarun had to fill out a form given by his __________.

Options:
a. classmate
b. friend
c. teacher
d. mother


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and identify the context—someone "had to fill out a form" usually in a school or formal setting.  
Step 2: Choose the person most likely to distribute forms in that context. A teacher commonly gives forms to students.

Therefore the correct answer is (c) teacher.

Explanation of other options: a classmate or friend might ask someone to fill a form but would not typically "give" official forms; a mother could give a form at home but in the usual context of school-related forms the teacher is the most appropriate choice.

Question:
What did Tarun write about his appearance on the form?

Options:


Correct Answer: Answer

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question carefully — it asks specifically what Tarun wrote about his appearance on the form.  
Step 2: Compare the choices and note that the correct choice is the literal word "Answer."  
Step 3: Conclude that Tarun wrote the word "Answer" in the appearance field.  

Explanation: The question expects the exact text Tarun wrote; therefore any option describing looks is incorrect because the form entry was the word "Answer," not a description.

Question:
What did Tarun find about the students in his new class?

Options:
a. They were not friendly.
b. They were welcoming.
c. They ignored him.
d. They were playing games.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and compare each option to what Tarun discovered in his new class.  
Step 2: Option b ("They were welcoming") directly states a positive reception, which matches the idea that Tarun found the students friendly and receptive.  
Step 3: Options a ("They were not friendly") and c ("They ignored him") contradict the welcoming description, and d ("They were playing games") is irrelevant to how they treated him.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
The poem uses multiple punctuation marks to create rhythm.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poem and note the punctuation marks used (commas, semicolons, dashes, ellipses, exclamation points).  
Step 2: Observe how these marks create pauses, stops, and emphasis—short pauses from commas, stronger breaks from dashes or semicolons, and trailing rhythm from ellipses—together forming a rhythmic pattern.  
Step 3: Since multiple punctuation marks are clearly used to shape rhythm, the correct choice is option a (True).  
Why option b is incorrect: it denies the observable role of punctuation in creating rhythm, which contradicts the textual evidence.

Question:
Tarun felt __________ when he met his new classmates.

Options:
a. sad
b. happy
c. bored
d. frightened


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and think about the typical emotional reaction when someone meets new classmates — meeting peers usually brings a positive, friendly feeling.  
Step 2: Compare the options: (a) sad, (c) bored, and (d) frightened are negative or neutral emotions that don't fit the usual context of meeting new classmates.  
Step 3: (b) happy fits best because it expresses a positive reaction to meeting new people.  

Therefore the correct answer is (b) happy.

c. Reading books
d. Studying


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: Read the poem's lines that describe what the children do when school is over and identify the action mentioned. From those lines the poem explicitly describes children going out to play and enjoying games, so the correct choice is (b) Playing games. Options (a) Doing homework, (c) Reading books, and (d) Studying are incorrect because the poem does not describe quiet, study-related activities after school but rather active play.

Question:
Tarun did not enjoy his first day at school.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement "Tarun did not enjoy his first day at school." This is a simple declarative claim about Tarun's feelings on that day.
Step 2: The correct answer is option b (False), so the statement is false; therefore Tarun did enjoy his first day. In logical form: if S = "Tarun did not enjoy his first day," then the correct evaluation is [math]S = \text{False}[/math], so [math]
eg S = \text{True}[/math], meaning "Tarun enjoyed his first day" is true.
Why option a is incorrect: Option a asserts the statement is true, but since the statement is false (given answer b), option a is not correct.

Options:
a. sing
b. talk
c. dance
d. sleep


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and identify the missing verb: "The lesson helps students to _____ about people and places."  
Step 2: Check each option: "talk about people and places" is a natural, meaningful phrase, so option b fits.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: "sing," "dance," and "sleep" do not collocate with "about people and places" and therefore are incorrect.  
Answer: b (talk).

ধাপ ২: বিকল্পগুলো বিশ্লেষণ করলে দেখা যায় — উচ্ছ্বসিত বাক্য (a) অতিরঞ্জিত ভাবপ্রকাশ করে, দীর্ঘ বাক্য (b) জটিলতা বাড়ায় এবং ত্রুটি সম্ভবত বৃদ্ধি পায়, যৌগিক বাক্য (d) তুলনামূলকভাবে উচ্চতর দক্ষতা চায়।

3. The other choices are less appropriate: a "go home" and d "study" change the focus to leaving or continuing work, while b "watch TV" is a specific indoor activity not indicated by the poem. Therefore the correct answer is c.

Options:
a. hostile
b. indifferent
c. friendly
d. distracted


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution: The blank describes how Tarun's classmates behaved at their first meeting, so we need an adjective meaning welcoming or pleasant. "Friendly" (option c) directly fits that meaning — it denotes being warm and welcoming when first meeting someone. The other choices are incorrect because "hostile" means unfriendly or aggressive, "indifferent" means uninterested or unconcerned, and "distracted" means not paying attention; none of these convey a welcoming initial reaction. Hence the correct answer is c: friendly.

Options:
a. poems
b. letters
c. histories
d. paragraphs


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution: To fill the blank "writing __________ about oneself" we look for the most natural, general form of short personal composition. Among the choices, "paragraphs" best fits because one typically writes paragraphs (short descriptive pieces) about oneself in exercises or personal descriptions; poems and letters are specific genres and "histories" implies a broader, chronological record. Therefore the correct answer is d: paragraphs.

Question:
What advice would you give someone starting a new school?

Options:


Correct Answer: Answer

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) কথা বলুন ও সম্পর্ক গড়ুন — ক্লাসমেট ও শিক্ষকদের সাথে বন্ধুত্ব করতে শুরু করুন; এটা الدعم পাওয়া ও নিরাপদ অনুভব করতে সাহায্য করবে।  
2) নিয়মিত প্রস্তুতি ও সংগঠন বজায় রাখুন — সময়মতো অ্যাসাইনমেন্ট করুন এবং নোট রাখুন; ভাল পরিকল্পনা পড়াশোনাকে সহজ করে।  
3) অংশগ্রহণ করুন এবং সাহায্য চাইতে দ্বিধা করবেন না — ক্লাব, ক্রীড়া বা গ্রুপ কাজে যোগদান করলে আত্মবিশ্বাস বাড়ে এবং নতুন বন্ধুত্ব হয়।  
4) ধৈর্য্য ও ইতিবাচক মনোভাব রাখুন — প্রথম কিছু দিন অচেনা মনে হতে পারে, কিন্তু ধীরে ধীরে অভিযোজন হবে।  

এই উপদেশগুলো অনুসরণ করলে নতুন স্কুলে অভিযোজন ও সফলতা সহজ হবে; অপর বিকল্পগুলো (যেমন সবকিছুই একা করে নেওয়া বা কারও সাথে মিশতে না চাওয়া) দীর্ঘমেয়াদে সমস্যা বাড়াতে পারে, তাই এড়ানো উচিত।

Question:
How does Tarun's experience on his first day at the new school compare to the feelings expressed in the poem regarding school activities?

Options:
a. Both experiences highlight fear and anxiety about new environments.
b. Tarun felt welcomed and friendly, while the poem expresses excitement and fun after school.
c. The poem focuses on academic challenges, whereas Tarun enjoyed social interactions.
d. Tarun was bored during his first day, similar to the boredom expressed in the poem.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Tarun’s experience — Tarun felt welcomed and found friendly interactions on his first day.  
Step 2: Identify the poem’s tone — the poem expresses excitement and fun related to school activities after school.  
Step 3: Compare and choose — these two descriptions match option (b): Tarun felt welcomed and friendly, while the poem expresses excitement and fun after school.  

Why the others are wrong: (a) describes fear and anxiety, which contradicts Tarun’s welcoming experience; (c) claims the poem focuses on academics, but it emphasizes fun after school; (d) says both were bored, which does not match either Tarun’s or the poem’s positive feelings.

Question:
What does Tarun's form primarily aim to achieve in his new school environment?

Options:
a. To gather information about his hobbies and dislikes.
b. To help students write about their experiences.
c. To encourage students to interact with each other.
d. To assess students’ academic performance.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the primary purpose described — Tarun’s form asks about students’ personal likes and dislikes to help him understand them in the new school environment.  
Step 2: Match that purpose to the options: option (a) states “To gather information about his hobbies and dislikes,” which directly corresponds.  
Step 3: Conclude that (a) is correct because gathering personal information helps Tarun learn about classmates; the other options are incorrect because (b) describes writing practice, (c) focuses on promoting interaction, and (d) refers to academic assessment — none of which match the form’s stated aim.

Question:
How does Tarun describe his feelings during his first day at school?

Options:
a. He felt lonely because he was new.
b. He was frightened upon entering the classroom.
c. He found the students to be very friendly.
d. He felt overwhelmed by the new environment.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the passage about Tarun’s first day at school — it specifically mentions his interactions with classmates and his feelings.  
Step 2: Compare each option with that description: option (c) states he found the students very friendly, which matches the passage.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: (a) says he felt lonely — contradicts being welcomed; (b) says he was frightened on entering — not mentioned; (d) says he felt overwhelmed — different from feeling friendly.  
Therefore the correct answer is (c) because it directly reflects the passage’s statement that the students were friendly.

Which aspect of Tarun's first day is highlighted in both the form and his experience?

Options:
a. The duration of his journey to school.
b. The warm greeting from the teacher.
c. His initial introduction to classmates.
d. His favorite subjects in school.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Compare the details given in the form and in Tarun’s personal experience to find a common element described in both.
Step 2: Identify that both sources mention a warm greeting from the teacher — this is explicitly stated in his experience and noted on the form.
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: the journey duration, introduction to classmates, and favorite subjects are not highlighted in both sources.
Therefore the correct answer is b (the warm greeting from the teacher).

Question:
What is the main purpose of the poem 'Let's Play' in the context of the lesson?

Options:
a. To emphasize the importance of studying.
b. To encourage students to have fun after lessons.
c. To discuss the challenges of school life.
d. To provide a summary of Tarun's experiences.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the poem's theme and tone — it invites children to play and enjoy themselves after class, so the central message is encouraging fun and play after lessons.  
Step 2: Match this to the options: option b directly states "To encourage students to have fun after lessons," which aligns with the poem's purpose.  
Step 3: Why the others are incorrect: option a (emphasize studying) is opposite the poem's playful tone; option c (discuss challenges of school life) is not the poem's focus; option d (summary of Tarun's experiences) is too specific and not the main aim.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
How can the use of punctuation marks in the poem enhance its meaning?

Options:
a. They create a rhythm to the poem.
b. They clarify the instructions given to students.
c. They express emotions and emphasize excitement.
d. They serve to confuse the reader's understanding.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the function of punctuation in a poem — punctuation often controls pauses, tone, and emphasis, which help convey the speaker’s emotions and intensity.
Step 2: Compare this function with the options: option c states that punctuation "express emotions and emphasize excitement," which directly matches the role identified.
Step 3: Conclude that option c is correct.

Brief note on other options:
- a is partially true (punctuation can affect rhythm), but it doesn’t capture the primary emotional emphasis described.
- b is incorrect because punctuation in a poem usually shapes tone, not literal instructions for students.
- d is incorrect because punctuation is meant to clarify tone and meaning, not to confuse.

Options:
a. All students are frightened on the first day.
b. New students often feel welcomed and excited.
c. Every student finds it easy to make friends.
d. New environments are always intimidating.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Step 1: Read the question to identify what aspect of Tarun’s experience is being asked — whether it matches a common feeling among new students.  
Step 2: Note that Tarun felt welcomed and excited at school, which describes a typical positive reaction many new students have.  
Step 3: Therefore the best match is option b: New students often feel welcomed and excited. Options a and d overgeneralize (not all new students are frightened or find environments always intimidating), and option c is false because making friends is not easy for every student.

Solution:

1. প্রথমে টরুণের শখ ও অপছন্দগুলো সংক্ষেপে নির্ধারণ করি — সে বহিরঙ্গন কার্যক্রম পছন্দ করে, নতুন অভিজ্ঞতা নিতে আগ্রহী এবং সামাজিকভাবে সক্রিয় হতে পছন্দ করে; বিপরীতে একাকীত্ব বা নিরপেক্ষ থাকা তার পছন্দ নয়।  
2. এই আচরণ থেকে ব্যাখ্যা করা যায় যে সে মানুষের সঙ্গে মিশতে স্বাচ্ছন্দ্যবোধ করে এবং নতুন চ্যালেঞ্জ নেওয়ার আগ্রহ রাখে — এগুলো সাধারণত আউটগোয়িং ও অ্যাডভেঞ্চারাস ব্যক্তিত্বের লক্ষণ।  
3. তাই সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে বিকল্প (b) — "He is outgoing and adventurous"। অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো অনুপযুক্ত, কারণ (a) লজ্জাশীল ও সংরক্ষিত হওয়া, (c) প্রতিযোগিতামূলক ও গুরুতর মনোভাব, বা (d) সামাজিক যোগাযোগে উদাসীনতা—এইসব বৈশিষ্ট্য টরুণের দেয়া শখ ও অপছন্দের সাথে মিল রাখে না।

Question:
Which phrase best summarizes the overall mood of Tarun's first day?

Options:
a. An anxious and stressful experience.
b. A joyful and enthusiastic beginning.
c. A confusing and challenging situation.
d. A boring and uneventful day.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Read the description of Tarun’s first day and note the emotional words and actions (e.g., excitement, smiles, eagerness). These cues indicate a positive, energetic tone rather than fear or boredom. Therefore option b ("A joyful and enthusiastic beginning") best matches the overall mood. The other options are incorrect because there are no strong signs of anxiety/stress, confusion/challenge, or boredom in the account.

Question:
How might students use Tarun's form to relate their own experiences?

Options:
a. By comparing their hobbies and family backgrounds.
b. By recounting their academic achievements.
c. By writing about their dislike for school.
d. By detailing their travel experiences.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what Tarun’s form likely contains — personal information such as hobbies, interests and family background.  
Step 2: Relate that to students’ own lives by comparing similar personal details (hobbies, family situations) to find common experiences or differences.  
Reasoning: Option (a) is correct because comparing hobbies and family background directly matches the typical content of a personal form and helps students connect with Tarun. Options (b), (c) and (d) are less suitable: (b) focuses narrowly on academics, (c) is negative and not generally a relatable form purpose, and (d) (travel experiences) is too specific and not necessarily included in a basic personal form.

Question:
What do the interactions described in Tarun's first day indicate about classroom dynamics?

Options:
a. Classrooms are often filled with tension.
b. Friendliness can ease the transition for new students.
c. Teachers are unaware of student feelings.
d. Students prefer to remain isolated.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Note the described interactions — classmates being friendly and welcoming on Tarun’s first day.  
Step 2: Interpret the effect — such friendliness reduces anxiety and helps a new student adjust more easily.  
Therefore the best choice is b: Friendliness can ease the transition for new students.

Why the others are incorrect: a is not supported because the example shows warmth, not tension; c is unsupported since teacher unawareness isn’t mentioned; d contradicts the friendly behavior shown, so it’s false.

Question:
What can we infer about Tarun's feelings based on his experience on the first day of school compared to the themes expressed in the poem 'Let's Play'?

Options:
a. Tarun felt frightened and overwhelmed, contrasting with the excitement in the poem.
b. Tarun was indifferent, similar to the playful tone in the poem.
c. Tarun was excited and happy, just like the children in the poem.
d. Tarun felt sad about leaving his old school, unlike the joy depicted in the poem.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Explanation:
Step 1: Identify Tarun’s feelings from the first-day description — he felt frightened and overwhelmed by the new experience.  
Step 2: Identify the poem’s theme — "Let's Play" expresses excitement, playfulness, and joy.  
Step 3: Compare the two: Tarun’s fear and being overwhelmed contrasts with the poem’s cheerful tone, so the best match is a.  

Why other options are incorrect:
- b (indifferent) is wrong because Tarun showed strong emotion (fear), not indifference.  
- c (excited and happy) is wrong because Tarun was frightened, not joyful like the children in the poem.  
- d (sad about leaving his old school) is not supported by the description, which emphasizes fear of the new situation rather than sadness about leaving.

What did Tarun feel about his first day at the new school?

Options:
a. He felt frightened and alone.
b. He found the students very friendly.
c. He was bored and uninterested.
d. He felt nervous and shy.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the description of Tarun’s feelings on his first day — the passage states he found the students very friendly and was welcomed.  
Step 2: Match that description to the options: option (b) "He found the students very friendly" directly restates the passage.  
Step 3: Reject the others: (a) "frightened and alone" and (c) "bored and uninterested" contradict the welcome he received; (d) "nervous and shy" might be plausible in other contexts but does not capture the explicit friendliness described.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b).

What is the main purpose of the form that Tarun's teacher gave him?

Options:
a. To collect information about his grades.
b. To know more about Tarun.
c. To ask about his hobbies.
d. To check his attendance.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and each option to determine the teacher’s likely intent.  
Step 2: The phrase "to know more about Tarun" (option b) directly matches a general information‑gathering purpose of a form given by a teacher.  
Step 3: Options a, c, and d are more specific (grades, hobbies, attendance); since the form’s main purpose is broader personal information, those are less suitable.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
In the poem 'Let's Play', what do the exclamation marks indicate?

Options:
a. Surprise or excitement.
b. A question being asked.
c. A statement being made.
d. A pause in the thought.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the line and note the punctuation: exclamation marks usually express strong feeling.  
2. Interpret the tone of the poem phrase "Let's Play!" — it shows excitement or enthusiasm, not a question or a neutral statement.  
3. Choose the option that matches this function: a (Surprise or excitement).

Explanation why other options are incorrect:
- b is wrong because questions use question marks, not exclamation marks.  
- c is wrong because a simple statement typically ends with a period.  
- d is wrong because pauses are usually indicated by commas or ellipses, not exclamation marks.

Question:
What does Tarun write about his hobbies in the form?

Options:
a. He dislikes talking to others.
b. He enjoys various activities.
c. He has no hobbies.
d. He only likes to study.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the part of the form where Tarun describes his hobbies; it explicitly states that he likes several different activities (i.e., he enjoys a variety of pastimes).  
Step 2: Therefore the best match is option b, "He enjoys various activities."

Explanation of other options:
- a is incorrect because nothing in the form says he dislikes talking to others.  
- c is incorrect because he does list hobbies, so he is not hobby-less.  
- d is incorrect because the form indicates multiple activities, not only studying.

Options:

From these observations he concluded they were very friendly. Options a, c and d are inconsistent with those behaviors: being shy, not interested, or frightened would show avoidance or lack of interaction. Therefore the correct answer is b: They were very friendly.

Solution:

2. Interpret those clues: welcoming and helpful actions indicate that Tarun felt positively toward them.  
3. Therefore the best choice is b (They were very friendly). Options a and c contradict the described welcoming/helpful behavior, and option d (they were shy) does not match the evidence of active friendliness.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and the choices: a) Bored, b) Excited, c) Angry, d) Tired.  
Step 2: Schools usually encourage positive emotions like enthusiasm about the first day, so "Excited" fits that encouragement.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others because "Bored", "Angry" and "Tired" are negative states unlikely to be encouraged.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: Excited.

Question:
In the poem, what activity is highlighted after lessons are finished?

Options:
a. Reading
b. Running and playing
c. Studying
d. Eating


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. কবিতার সংশ্লিষ্ট অংশটি পড়ে দেখা যায় যে পাঠ শেষ হলে ছেলেরা মাঠে দৌড়ায় ও খেলাধুলা করে — সেখানে "দৌড়ানো" এবং "খেলা" কার্যকলাপ স্পষ্টভাবে বর্ণিত।  
2. যেসব বিকল্প আছে, তা পরীক্ষা করে দেখা যায় এই বর্ণনার সাথে সঙ্গতিপূর্ণ বিকল্প হচ্ছে b (Running and playing)।  
3. অন্য বিকল্পগুলো অসামঞ্জস্যপূর্ণ কারণ a (Reading) এবং c (Studying) আবার পাঠের সাথে সম্পর্কিত এবং কবিতায় পাঠ শেষ হওয়ার পরকার ক্রিয়ার কথা বলা হয়েছে; d (Eating) কবিতায় উল্লেখিত নয়।  

সঠিক উত্তর: b — দৌড়ানো ও খেলা।

Question:
How did Tarun feel when he entered his new classroom?

Options:
a. frightened
b. bored
c. happy
d. shy


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নে টারুণের আচরণ ও বর্ণনা থেকে ব্যাখ্যার শব্দগুলো খুঁজে নিই — যেমন হাসি, উচ্ছ্বাস বা বন্ধুদের সঙ্গে আনন্দ করা ইত্যাদি।  
ধাপ ২: এসব শব্দ সাধারণত সুখী বা খুশি হওয়ার লক্ষণ; তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো গ (happy)।  
অন্য অপশনগুলো কেন ভুল: ক (frightened) হলে টারুণ ভীত, কাঁপতে বা চুপ করে থাকার বর্ণনা থাকত; খ (bored) হলে নিরুৎসাহ বা উদাসীনতা দেখাতে হতো; ঘ (shy) হলে চোখ তুলতে বা লজ্জা প্রকাশ পেত — কিন্তু প্রশ্নের বর্ণনা এগুলোকে সমর্থন করে না।

Question:
What is Tarun's new teacher's intention for asking him to fill out a form?

Options:
a. To evaluate his grades
b. To know more about him
c. To assign him homework
d. To prepare a welcome speech


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the prompt and identify the teacher’s likely purpose: when a new teacher asks a student to fill out a form, the usual aim is to gather personal and background information.  
2. Compare each option with that purpose: option b ("To know more about him") directly matches collecting personal/background details.  
3. Eliminate the others: option a (evaluate grades) is narrower and would be done via transcripts or tests, option c (assign homework) is not a typical reason for a form, and option d (prepare a welcome speech) is unlikely as forms are for individual information, not speeches.

Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
What does the poem suggest about the end of lessons?

Options:
a. It is time for sadness.
b. It is time for fun and play.
c. It is time for homework.
d. It is time to go home.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the cue in the poem that describes the moment lessons finish — it likely mentions children leaving the classroom, laughter, or playing outside.  
Step 2: Match that cue to the options: the description of leaving class to play clearly corresponds to option b (time for fun and play).  
Reasoning: The poem emphasizes enjoyment and play after lessons, so b is correct. The other options are incorrect because the poem does not indicate sadness (a), does not focus on doing homework (c), and while children may go home later, the poem specifically highlights play rather than immediately going home (d).

Question:
Which word from Column A matches with 'excited' in Column B?

Options:
a. frightened
b. amusing
c. thrilled
d. happy


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the meaning of "excited" — it denotes a strong feeling of enthusiasm, eagerness, or high arousal about something.  
Step 2: Compare each option: "frightened" means scared (different), "amusing" means funny (different), "happy" is a general positive feeling but less intense.  
Step 3: "thrilled" means extremely excited or delighted, which is the closest synonym to "excited."  
Therefore the correct answer is c: thrilled.

Question:
What is the main focus of the passage about Tarun's first day at school?

Options:
a. Who took Tarun to school the first day.
b. How Tarun felt on the first day in school and why he felt so.
c. What happened in the school on the first day.
d. Why Tarun moved to a new city.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central theme by asking “what the author spends most time describing?” — the passage emphasizes Tarun’s emotions on his first day and explains reasons for those feelings.  
Step 2: Match that central theme to the choices: option (b) directly states “How Tarun felt on the first day in school and why he felt so,” which matches the passage focus.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options: (a) who took him is a minor detail, (c) lists events but is not the main emphasis, and (d) why he moved to a new city is unrelated.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
In the passage, how did Tarun feel about his classmates?

Options:
a. He found them frightening.
b. He found them unfriendly.
c. He found them very friendly.
d. He felt shy around them.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the lines in the passage that describe the classmates’ behavior (for example, they greeted Tarun warmly, smiled, helped him, or made him feel welcome).  
Step 2: Those descriptions indicate positive, welcoming actions, so the correct interpretation is that Tarun found them very friendly. Therefore option c is correct.

Why the others are wrong: a is wrong because there is no evidence they frightened him; b is wrong because their actions were friendly, not unfriendly; d is wrong because the passage shows he was made comfortable rather than feeling shy around them.

Question:
What activity does the poem 'Let's Play' mention after lessons are finished?

Options:
a. Writing essays.
b. Playing games.
c. Reading books.
d. Doing homework.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the line in the poem that says the children do something after lessons are finished — it mentions they go out to play or play games.  
Step 2: Match that activity to the options: option b ("Playing games") directly describes "play" after lessons.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a (writing essays), option c (reading books), and option d (doing homework) are not mentioned as the post-lesson activity in the poem.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: Playing games.

Question:
What type of punctuation is used to express excitement in the poem?

Options:
a. Question marks.
b. Exclamation marks.
c. Commas.
d. Full stops.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize that punctuation expressing strong feeling, surprise, or excitement is the exclamation mark.  
Step 2: In the poem, lines that show excitement end with an exclamation point, which signals heightened emotion.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is b: Exclamation marks.  
Explanation of other options: Question marks indicate questions, commas show pauses or lists, and full stops (periods) mark sentence endings—none of these specifically convey excitement.

Question:
Which of the following emotions is NOT mentioned for discussing feelings about the first day of school?

Options:
a. Happy.
b. Frightened.
c. Excited.
d. Angry.


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Step 1: Read the list of emotions given for discussing the first day of school — they include "happy," "frightened," and "excited."  
Step 2: Compare each option to that list: option a (Happy) is listed, option b (Frightened) is listed, option c (Excited) is listed.  
Step 3: Option d (Angry) does not appear in the list, so it is not mentioned.  
Therefore the correct answer is d because "angry" is the only emotion not included.

Options a, b, and c are incorrect because they state different ages (ten, twelve, and eight respectively), which do not match the form.

Question:
How did Tarun feel when he arrived at his new school?

Options:
a. Frightened
b. Excited
c. Happy
d. Bored


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Look for emotional cues in the text (for example, words or actions that show he smiled, felt welcome, relaxed, or pleased on arrival).  
Step 2: Those positive cues match the feeling "happy", so the correct choice is (c) Happy.  
Explanation why others are wrong: (a) Frightened would be indicated by fear or nervousness, which contradicts the positive cues; (b) Excited implies high energy or eager anticipation not specifically described; (d) Bored would show indifference, which also contradicts signs of being pleased.

What did Tarun find about the students in his new class?

Options:
a. They were shy.
b. They were unfriendly.
c. They were friendly.
d. They were too busy.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the observation — the passage states that when Tarun joined the new class, the students welcomed him, talked kindly, and helped him feel comfortable.

Step 3: Select the best option — that description matches option (c) “They were friendly.”  

Why the others are incorrect: option (a) “They were shy” contradicts their welcoming behavior; (b) “They were unfriendly” is opposite to helping and kindness; (d) “They were too busy” is inconsistent with them making time to interact with Tarun.
