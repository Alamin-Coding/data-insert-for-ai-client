Question:
What should students do with their test materials after finishing?

Options:


Correct Answer: Submit to the teacher.

Solution:
Solution:
1. When you finish, stop writing and quickly check your answer sheet to ensure your name, roll number, and answers are complete.
2. Gather all test materials (answer sheet, question paper, scrap paper) and place them together so nothing is left behind.
3. Submit the collected materials to the teacher or exam proctor as instructed.

Explanation: Submitting to the teacher ensures your work is collected for grading and maintains exam security; keeping the papers, discarding them, or taking them home would prevent proper grading or violate exam rules.

Question:
What is one thing students are advised against during the test?

Options:


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: প্রশ্নের নির্দেশ বা পরামর্শগুলো মনোযোগ দিয়ে পড়ুন এবং নিষেধসূচক বাক্য খুঁজে বের করুন।  
Step 2: যে পরামর্শটি সরাসরি কিছু করা থেকে বিরত রাখে সেটিই নিষেধবাচক; এখানে স্পষ্টভাবে বলা হয়েছে "Do not cheat" — অর্থাৎ প্রতিলিপি করা বা চিটিং করা থেকে বিরত থাকুন।  
Step 3: তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো — ছাত্রছাত্রীদের পরীক্ষা চলাকালে চিটিং করা থেকে বিরত থাকতে বলা হয়েছে। অন্যান্য সম্ভাব্য বিকল্পগুলো (যেমন সময়মতো হাজির হওয়া বা প্রশ্ন জিজ্ঞাসা করা) সাধারণত নির্দেশনা বা অনুশাসন হতে পারে, কিন্তু প্রশ্নে সরাসরি নিষেধ করা অংশটি হচ্ছে "চিট করবেন না"।

Question:
Which of the following is NOT mentioned as an action students should take?

Options:
a. Copy
b. Discuss answers
c. Read carefully
d. Write down the instructions


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read each option and compare with the list of actions students are told to take.  
Step 2: Eliminate options that match typical instructions: copying (a), reading carefully (c), and writing down the instructions (d) are all standard actions students are told to do.  
Step 3: Option b, "Discuss answers," is not mentioned, so it is the correct choice.  

Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
The text includes instructions for a science test.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Step 1: Read the statement "The text includes instructions for a science test" and identify what it claims. Step 2: Examine the actual text content — it does not contain any directives, procedures, or guidelines that would qualify as instructions for administering or taking a science test. Therefore the claim is false, so option (b) False is correct. Option (a) True is incorrect because there are no instructional elements in the text to support that choice.

Before writing, students should __________ the instructions.

Options:
a. ignore
b. read
c. lose
d. misunderstand


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and identify the intended meaning — before starting to write, a student should follow or understand the given directions.  
Step 2: Compare the options: "read" directly matches the action needed to know the instructions, while "ignore", "lose", and "misunderstand" are inappropriate actions that would prevent following directions.  
Therefore the correct choice is b (read).

Question:
What indicates to students that they should slow down?

Options:


Correct Answer: SLOW sign.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the cue that gives a direct instruction to reduce speed — a sign that literally says "SLOW".  
Step 2: Reasoning — the word "SLOW" is an explicit verbal command telling students to decrease their pace; signs are placed where reduced speed is required (e.g., near crossings or hazards).  
Step 3: Elimination — other signs like "STOP" require a full stop, and general caution symbols warn of danger but do not explicitly instruct to slow down, so they are not the best answer.  
Therefore the correct indicator that students should slow down is the SLOW sign.

Question:
What must students do with their personal information on the script?

Options:
a. Draw on it
b. Write it down
c. Forget about it
d. Give it to a friend


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the instruction — students are asked to include their personal information on the script, which means they must record it there.  
Step 2: The best matching option is b: "Write it down" because that directly means placing personal details on the script.  
Why the others are incorrect: a ("Draw on it") does not convey recording information, c ("Forget about it") contradicts the instruction, and d ("Give it to a friend") moves the information off the script instead of putting it on it.

Question:
Students are encouraged to use the __________ during their break.

Options:
a. library
b. playground
c. classroom
d. study hall


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the likely activity during a break — breaks are typically for rest and physical activity rather than quiet study.  
Step 2: Eliminate options that are meant for studying or instruction: the library and study hall are for quiet work, and the classroom is for lessons.  
Step 3: Choose the option that fits the purpose of a break: the playground is intended for recreation and physical activity.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) playground.

The students cannot __________ before one hour is over.

Options:
a. leave
b. write
c. talk
d. laugh


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
The phrase "cannot __________ before one hour is over" means "not allowed to do something until one hour has passed." The verb that naturally fits this permission-to-depart context is "leave," so the correct choice is (a) leave. Options (b) write, (c) talk, and (d) laugh are possible actions but do not match the common meaning of being prevented from departing until an hour is finished.

Question:
Which command is often used to maintain class order?

Options:
a. Be loud
b. Be quiet
c. Be funny
d. Be rude


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: To maintain class order the teacher should give clear, calm commands that reduce noise and disruptions. Among the options, "Be quiet" achieves that goal by asking students to lower their voices and focus, so the correct choice is b. The other options are unsuitable because "Be loud" and "Be funny" encourage distraction, and "Be rude" is harmful to classroom management.

Question:
The text describes a joyful and carefree atmosphere.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the text and note tone words and imagery—look for markers of joy (e.g., “laughter,” “carefree,” “bright”) or their opposites (e.g., “somber,” “tense,” “melancholy”). 
Step 2: The text lacks joyful/carefree markers and instead uses language suggesting a different mood (seriousness or nostalgia), so the claim that it describes a joyful, carefree atmosphere is incorrect.
Therefore the correct answer is b (False); option a is wrong because it assumes a positive, carefree tone not supported by the textual cues.

It is important to __________ your own work during the test.

Options:
a. examine
b. prove
c. preserve
d. manage


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and determine the intended meaning — the sentence advises an action you should do to your work during the test.  
Step 2: Check each option for sense and common usage: "examine" means to check or review (fits perfectly), "prove" means to demonstrate correctness (not typically done to your own work during a test), "preserve" means to keep safe (irrelevant here), and "manage" means to handle or organize (less precise than "examine").  
Conclusion: The best and most natural choice is "examine", so the correct answer is a.

What is one thing students should refrain from doing during the examination?

Options:


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and identify actions that might be inappropriate during an exam—those that compromise fairness or exam rules.  
Step 2: Discussing with peers is clearly prohibited because it can lead to cheating, gives an unfair advantage, and distracts others and the invigilator.  
Step 3: Therefore, students should refrain from discussing with peers during the examination; other actions like asking the invigilator for clarification or working quietly on your paper are acceptable and not equivalent to discussion.

Which of the following actions ensures academic integrity?

Options:
a. Cheating
b. Copying someone else
c. Reading the questions carefully
d. Ignoring instructions


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Academic integrity means honest, responsible behavior in learning and assessment—no cheating, no copying, and following rules and instructions.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: a (Cheating) violates integrity; b (Copying someone else) also violates integrity; d (Ignoring instructions) goes against honest conduct and can lead to misconduct. Option c (Reading the questions carefully) is consistent with integrity because it involves honestly understanding and responding to the work.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is c.

c. teacher allows
d. next subject


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Consider typical classroom rules: leaving during class or an exam should be controlled to avoid disturbance and ensure student safety. The authority to allow leaving normally rests with the teacher, so the correct choice is c teacher allows.
2. Options a exam ends, b break time, and d next subject are incorrect because they either depend on a fixed schedule (which may not apply) or are irrelevant to permission; the teacher’s permission is the appropriate and general rule.

Question:
What sign warns about traffic in front of the hospital?

Options:


Correct Answer: Hospital ahead!

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the meaning of the road sign — the sign showing a hospital (commonly a white "H" on a blue background) indicates that a hospital is ahead and that there may be hospital-related traffic.  
Step 2: Therefore the correct warning sign is "Hospital ahead!" because it alerts drivers to expect ambulances and increased movement, so they should slow down and be cautious.  
Step 3: Other signs like "School ahead" or "Stop" do not specifically warn about hospital traffic, so they are not correct.

Students are allowed to use cheat sheets during the test.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the statement "Students are allowed to use cheat sheets during the test" as claiming that cheat sheets are generally permitted during exams.  
Step 2: Standard exam rules and academic integrity policies prohibit unauthorized aids (cheating) unless an instructor explicitly permits a cheat sheet.  
Step 3: Since the general statement is false under normal testing rules, the correct answer is option b (False).  
Explanation: Option a is incorrect because permitting cheat sheets would violate typical exam/academic integrity policies unless specifically allowed.

Solution:
Step 1: Read the instruction—students should remove items that could give them an unfair advantage or are not needed for the test.  
Step 2: The item that must be put away is books and papers because those can contain information relevant to the test, so choose option a.  
Other options are incorrect because pencils (b) are needed to take the test, and lunchboxes (c) or backpacks (d) may be stored away but the primary required item to put away to prevent access to information is books and papers.

Ms. Chowdhury instructs students to write their __________ on the script.

Options:
a. favorite subjects
b. name
c. hobbies
d. friends


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the context — a teacher asking students to write something "on the script" typically means information needed to identify the paper.  
Step 2: Compare options: "name" is the usual identifying detail; "favorite subjects", "hobbies", or "friends" are not required for identifying a script.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) name, because it uniquely identifies the student on the script while the other options are irrelevant.

Which term best characterizes the classroom environment before instructions are given?

Options:
a. Calm
b. Noisy
c. Quiet

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the context — "before instructions are given" suggests the period when students are settling, talking, or otherwise preparing rather than being quiet and focused.  
Step 2: Compare options — b "Noisy" best matches that typical pre-instruction situation; a "Calm", c "Quiet", and d "Serene" all imply low sound and focused behavior, which is less likely before instructions begin.  
Conclusion: The correct answer is b (Noisy).

Step 3: Briefly why others are wrong: (b) would discuss historical development and dates, (c) would describe experiments and results, and (d) would focus on creative activities; those themes are not present in an instructional text, so they are incorrect.

Step 2 — choose the option whose meaning matches that context: "cleanup" (option a) means to clear and tidy the desk, so it fits. Step 3 — eliminate the others: "decorate" (b) is inappropriate before a test, "move" (c) doesn't convey tidying, and "ignore" (d) is opposite to the expected behavior.

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:

Step 2: Choose the behavior that gets the teacher’s attention quietly and appropriately. Option a (raise their hand) is correct because it is respectful, keeps the room quiet, and follows standard exam procedure.  

Explanation of incorrect options:
- b (speak loudly) is wrong because it disturbs other students.

Step 1: Interpret the statement — it says the teacher gives out the exam scripts (question papers/answer booklets) before the examination starts.  
Step 2: Reasoning — standard examination procedure is to distribute required materials to students prior to the official start time so they can read instructions and be ready when the exam begins.  
Therefore the statement is True, so the correct choice is a. Option b is incorrect because teachers do not wait until after the exam has started to hand out the scripts.

Question:
When students see the sign 'Playground' they should __________.

Options:
a. run
b. play
c. walk carefully
d. ignore


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sign "Playground" — it identifies an area where children play and where people (especially students) will be present.  
Step 2: Consider safety and expected behavior — in places with children and equipment, moving carefully reduces the risk of collisions or accidents.  
Step 3: Match this with the options: "walk carefully" is the safest and most appropriate response, while "run" can cause accidents, "play" may be allowed but doesn't address safe movement, and "ignore" is unsafe.  
Therefore the correct choice is (c) walk carefully.

Question:
What action does Ms. Chowdhury expect from the students regarding their scripts?

Options:
a. Share them with others
b. Copy from them
c. Fill them out correctly
d. Throw them away


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the teacher’s expected action — Ms. Chowdhury wants students to do something appropriate with their scripts.  
Step 2: Compare the options: sharing or copying the scripts (options a and b) would defeat individual work or privacy, and throwing them away (d) is unreasonable.  
Step 3: The sensible instruction is to complete them properly, so option c (Fill them out correctly) matches the expectation.  
Therefore the correct answer is c.
