Question:
How is the Taj Mahal viewed in the context of world heritage?

Options:


Correct Answer: It is considered one of the wonders of the world.

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the monument: the Taj Mahal is a 17th-century ivory-white marble mausoleum in Agra, renowned for its architecture and historical significance.  
2. Note its recognitions: it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 and was later included in the global New7Wonders list (2007).  
3. Conclusion: because of its universal cultural value and its inclusion in those international recognitions, the Taj Mahal is viewed as one of the wonders of the world — which is the correct answer.  
4. Why other options would be less accurate: calling it merely a national monument or a local landmark understates its global recognition; describing it as a modern building or an insignificant site would be incorrect given its UNESCO status and worldwide acclaim.

What is the primary purpose of the Taj Mahal?

Options:
a. A museum
b. A palace
c. A tomb
d. A fort


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the historical purpose — the Taj Mahal was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal and built as her final resting place, i.e., a mausoleum or tomb.  
Step 2: Use that fact to choose the option that matches this purpose: a tomb (option c).  
Step 3: Eliminate the others — it was not constructed primarily as a museum, a royal residence (palace), or a military fort, so options a, b, and d are incorrect.  

Therefore the correct answer is c.

Mumtaz Mahal died at a __________ age.

Options:
a. young
b. old
c. retired
d. advanced


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: Mumtaz Mahal died in 1631 at about 39 years of age, while giving birth to her fourteenth child. Since 39 is considered relatively young and she died in childbirth rather than of old age or after retirement, the appropriate choice is "young". The other options — "old", "retired", and "advanced" — do not fit the historical fact that she died at a comparatively young age.

Which of the following best describes the architectural style of the Taj Mahal?

Options:
a. Gothic
b. Baroque
c. Mughal
d. Neoclassical


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Step 1: Recall historical origin — the Taj Mahal was commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 17th-century India as an imperial mausoleum.  
Step 2: Identify key architectural features — large central onion dome, symmetrical layout, iwans (arched portals), minarets, pietra dura inlay and Persian/Islamic decorative motifs, all characteristic of Mughal architecture.  
Step 3: Match features to options — these traits correspond to Mughal style, so the correct choice is (c) Mughal.  
Why the others are incorrect: Gothic refers to medieval European pointed arches and flying buttresses, Baroque to highly ornate 17th–18th century European drama and curves, and Neoclassical to Greek/Roman revival forms; none match the Taj Mahal’s Mughal-Persian synthesis.

Question:
The Taj Mahal was built with only Indian artists.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Check historical evidence: the Taj Mahal was commissioned by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and built by a large workforce under chief architect Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, with documented contributions from artists and craftsmen of different origins.  
Step 2 — Key facts: calligrapher Amanat Khan came from Shiraz (Persia), many master masons, inlayers, and artisans were Persian, Central Asian and other non-Indian specialists alongside Indian craftsmen.  
Step 3 — Conclusion: because artisans from Persia and Central Asia (and others) participated, the statement "The Taj Mahal was built with only Indian artists" is false.  
Therefore the correct answer is b (False).

The Eiffel Tower is recognized as a __________ icon of France.

Options:
a. natural
b. cultural
c. political
d. historical


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize what the Eiffel Tower represents — it is a man-made landmark built as a symbol of Paris and France, widely used in art, media, tourism and national identity.  
Step 2: Match that role to the options: an emblem of national identity, arts and popular culture corresponds to "cultural."  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: it is not a natural feature (so not a), not primarily a political institution or office (c), and although it has historical significance, its main recognition is cultural rather than merely historical (d).

Therefore the correct answer is b: cultural.

Step 2: Recall historical and architectural facts — the Taj Mahal was constructed in the 17th century using primarily white Makrana marble (with some red sandstone and inlay work), not wood.  
Step 3: Conclude — the claim is false, so the correct answer is b. Option a is incorrect because the main material is marble, not wood.

Question:
The number of artisans who worked on the Taj Mahal was __________.

Options:
a. hundreds
b. thousands
c. dozens
d. millions


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The Taj Mahal was a massive 17th-century construction project that required specialist craftsmen, stonecutters, inlayers, masons and many laborers over more than two decades. Historical accounts and scholarly estimates put the workforce in the thousands (commonly cited figures around 20,000 people), so the correct choice is b: thousands. 

Explanation why others are wrong: "Dozens" or "hundreds" are far too small for such an elaborate, large-scale monument; "millions" is unrealistically large for a pre-industrial project and for the recorded historical evidence.

Options:


Correct Answer: Its intricate architecture and design.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what "masterpiece" implies — exceptional artistic or architectural quality.  
Step 2: Examine the Taj Mahal's features: its perfectly balanced symmetry, finely carved white marble, intricate pietra dura inlay work, and elegant calligraphy, all of which demonstrate extraordinary craftsmanship and aesthetic design.  
Step 3: Conclude that the best reason is its intricate architecture and design, since these visible, measurable artistic qualities are what critics and historians cite when calling it a masterpiece.  
Brief note on other choices: factors like its historical significance or location contribute to its fame but do not alone justify the label "masterpiece" as directly as its architectural and design excellence.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The Taj Mahal was built between 1632 and 1653 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan.

Therefore the correct answer is option c: Mughal Era.  
Why others are incorrect: Independence Era refers to post-1947 India, Medieval Era generally refers to an earlier period before the Mughal high point, and Colonial Era refers to later European/British rule—none match the 17th-century Mughal context.

What does the Taj Mahal symbolize?

Options:


Correct Answer: Enduring love and loss.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Historical basis — the Taj Mahal was commissioned by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal after her death, so its origin is an act of mourning and devotion.  
Step 2: Symbolic reasoning — because it was built as a tomb out of grief and lasting devotion, the monument is most directly interpreted as symbolizing enduring love and loss.  
Step 3: Why other options are weaker — although the Taj Mahal also displays wealth, power, and architectural beauty, those are secondary attributes; the primary, widely accepted symbolism is enduring love and loss.

Step 3: Therefore the statement "The Giza pyramids are considered to be the only remaining wonder of the ancient world" is true.

The main reason Shah Jahan constructed the Taj Mahal was __________.

Options:
a. for a military purpose
b. as a memorial for his wife
c. for a public gathering
d. as a place of worship


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the historical fact that Shah Jahan commissioned the Taj Mahal after the death of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.  
Step 2: Note the building’s primary features — a central tomb, cenotaphs, and funerary inscriptions — which identify it as a mausoleum built in memory of a person.  
Step 3: Conclude that the main reason was as a memorial for his wife, so option (b) is correct.

Explanation why other options are incorrect: it was not built for military purposes (no fortifications or defensive design), not primarily for public gatherings (though people visit it today, that was not the purpose), and it was not constructed as a place of worship (though a mosque stands nearby, the Taj itself is a tomb).

Options:


Correct Answer: It is the finest example of Mughal architecture.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question — it asks for the Taj Mahal’s significance with respect to Mughal architecture, so identify the defining architectural qualities to compare.  
Step 2: Note key features of the Taj Mahal — perfect symmetry and axial planning, extensive use of white marble, fine pietra dura inlay work, large central dome flanked by minarets, and a synthesis of Persian, Indian and Islamic design elements. These qualities exemplify the aesthetic refinement and technical achievement of the Mughal style.  
Step 3: Conclude that, based on these distinctive features and its historical reputation, the Taj Mahal is rightly considered the finest example of Mughal architecture.  
Brief note on other options: alternatives like calling it merely a mosque or a fort omit its broader architectural and artistic significance as an exemplary Mughal monument.

Step 2: The tower was completed and officially opened in 1889, timed to coincide with the fair.

Correct Answer: The death of Mumtaz Mahal.

Solution:
Solution: The Taj Mahal was constructed as a mausoleum commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after the death of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Historical records state Shah Jahan began building it around 1632 to house her tomb, and the building’s plan, inscriptions and central tomb confirm its funerary purpose. Therefore the event that led to its construction was the death of Mumtaz Mahal. Other choices (for example, her birth, their marriage, or a military victory) are incorrect because contemporary sources and the monument’s function all point to it being a memorial for the deceased empress.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Known approximate area (treated here for the purpose of the estimate) is about [math]4.06\ \text{km}^2[/math]. Convert square kilometers to acres using [math]1\ \text{km}^2 = 247.105\ \text{acres}[/math].

Therefore the closest option is b: 1003 acres.

Why others are incorrect: the other choices (500, 3000, 700) do not match the standard conversion result above and are far from the computed value.

Correct Answer: খ

Step 2: Historical records and contemporary accounts identify her as Shah Jahan’s principal consort, married to him and serving as his beloved wife until her death.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct relationship is that Mumtaz Mahal was his wife; she was not his daughter, sister, or mother, so those alternatives are incorrect.
