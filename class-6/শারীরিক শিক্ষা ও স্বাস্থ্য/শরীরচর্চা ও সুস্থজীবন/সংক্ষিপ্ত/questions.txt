Question:
What is the primary purpose of physical exercise as described in the text?

Options:


Correct Answer: To improve physical and mental health.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — Read the text to identify the main idea: what outcome the author emphasizes most when describing physical exercise.

Working steps:
1. Define the term briefly: physical exercise means planned bodily activity that raises heart rate and works muscles.
2. Extract main claims from the text: statements about benefits such as stronger body, better fitness, reduced illness, improved mood or mental clarity.
3. Compare those claims and identify the recurring emphasis — the text repeatedly links exercise to better bodily functioning and improved mental state.
4. Conclude the primary purpose based on that emphasis.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Physical health: cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength, flexibility, and disease prevention.
- Mental health: reduced stress and anxiety, improved mood, better sleep, and enhanced cognitive function.
- Principle of causation: regular exercise produces both physiological and psychological benefits, so the chief aim in the text is health improvement.

Logical reasoning:
The text lists multiple outcomes but repeatedly frames exercise as a means to enhance overall wellbeing. Since both bodily and mental improvements are highlighted as the intended results, the primary purpose is to promote health in both domains.

Final answer:
The primary purpose of physical exercise, as described in the text, is to improve physical and mental health.

Explanation:
Explanation: The primary purpose of physical exercise is to improve physical health by strengthening muscles, boosting cardiovascular fitness, flexibility and endurance. It also enhances mental health by reducing stress and improving mood and cognitive function through the release of beneficial hormones and neurotransmitters.

Question:
What is meant by 'daily assembly' in the context of physical education?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — define the term, state its purposes in physical education, outline how it is conducted, and give a short illustrative example.

Working steps:
1. Definition: A daily assembly is a regular, usually morning, gathering of students and teachers where routines related to discipline and physical activity are carried out.
2. Typical structure (essential steps during an assembly):
   - Gathering and formation (lining up, attendance, brief silence).
   - Warm-up and calisthenics (stretching, joint movements, simple drills).
   - Discipline and values segment (short talks on punctuality, teamwork, rules).
   - Announcements and organization for the day (sports fixtures, reminders).
3. Key purposes and concepts:
   - Physical fitness: provides short, routine physical activity to improve flexibility, circulation, and readiness for the day.
   - Discipline and order: reinforces punctuality, uniformity, and self-control.
   - Social and educational: builds group cohesion, communication of important information, and promotion of sportsmanship.
4. Reasoning: In physical education, daily assembly links mental preparedness (discipline, attention) with physical readiness (warm-up), reducing injury risk and creating a habitual framework for ongoing physical training and school-wide coordination.

Example (brief): A 10–15 minute morning assembly might begin with roll call, 5 minutes of stretching and light jogging in place, a 2–3 minute instructor reminder about fair play and safety, and final announcements about the day’s PE schedule.

Concise definition: A gathering of students and teachers for maintaining discipline and performing brief physical activities aimed at fitness, readiness, and school coordination.

Question:
Which of the following is NOT a benefit of regular exercise mentioned in the text?

Options:


Correct Answer: Increased stress levels.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach:
- Identify typical benefits of regular exercise as described in the text.
- Compare each option to those benefits and eliminate any choice that conflicts with them.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. List common benefits usually mentioned for regular exercise: improved cardiovascular health, weight control, stronger muscles and bones, improved mood, better sleep, increased energy, and reduced stress levels.
2. Check the option "Increased stress levels" against this list. It directly contradicts the well-established benefit "reduced stress levels" (exercise is known to lower stress by releasing endorphins and improving mood).
3. Since all other listed items are positive health outcomes consistent with the text, the one that is not a benefit is the option that claims a negative outcome — "Increased stress levels."

Relevant concepts:
- Exercise-induced endorphin release and improved psychological resilience lead to lower stress and better mood.
- Regular physical activity lowers risk factors for chronic disease and improves overall well-being.

Conclusion:
The statement "Increased stress levels" is NOT a benefit of regular exercise; therefore it is the correct (non-benefit) answer.

Explanation:
"Increased stress levels" is not a benefit because regular exercise generally reduces stress rather than increases it. Exercise releases endorphins, lowers stress hormones (like cortisol), and improves sleep and mood, so higher stress would contradict the well‑established positive effects.

Question:
What should be considered when determining the type of exercise for students?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
Start by assessing three key characteristics of each student — age, height, and physical ability — then use those assessments to choose exercises that are safe, effective, and developmentally appropriate.

Step-by-step reasoning and essential steps:
1. Assess age and developmental stage
- Younger children (early childhood): prefer play-based, short-duration, skill‑development activities that build basic motor skills, coordination and balance. Avoid heavy resistance or long endurance sessions.
- Older children and adolescents: can handle more structured drills, strength training with proper technique, and sport-specific conditioning as their musculoskeletal and cognitive maturity increases.
Reason: Age determines physiological readiness (bone growth, neuromuscular control), attention span, and motor learning capacity.

2. Consider height and body proportions
- Height and limb length affect biomechanics and equipment fit (e.g., bike size, bench height, stride length).
- Adapt exercises or equipment to match body size to prevent awkward movement patterns and reduce injury risk.
Reason: Proper fit optimizes movement efficiency and safety.

3. Evaluate physical ability and fitness level
- Measure current fitness components: cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength/endurance, flexibility, balance, coordination. Include medical history and any disabilities.
- Identify limitations (joint problems, asthma, recent injuries) and strengths.
Reason: Physical ability guides intensity, volume, and type (e.g., low-impact vs high-impact; stability work vs explosive training).

4. Match exercise type to the combined assessment
- Low age + limited ability: games, obstacle courses, basic gymnastics, playground activities.
- Moderate age + average ability: bodyweight strength, agility drills, moderate aerobic activities.
- Older adolescents with good ability: progressive resistance training, interval conditioning, sport-specific skill training.
- Adjust for height/proportions by modifying equipment, range of motion, or technique cues.

5. Apply principles of safety, progression, and individualization
- Start low and progress gradually (overload and progression).
- Ensure proper technique, supervision, and appropriate rest.
- Make adaptations for inclusivity (alternate movements, scaled loads).
- Monitor response and adjust plans.

Examples (concise, illustrative):
- An 8-year-old short-stature child: focus on play-based coordination games, light bodyweight activities, and equipment sized for children.
- A 16-year-old tall adolescent with good endurance: incorporate structured running intervals, progressive resistance training with proper load and technique, and sport-specific drills.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Developmentally appropriate practice: match tasks to cognitive and physical maturity.
- Biomechanics and equipment ergonomics: fit influences movement quality.
- Individualization and progressive overload: tailor intensity and increase gradually.
- Safety screening and contraindications: medical/orthopedic considerations must guide exercise choices.

Conclusion:
When determining exercise type for students, evaluate age, height, and physical ability together to choose safe, effective, and developmentally appropriate activities, and then apply progression, technique coaching, and necessary adaptations.

Question:
What is 'warm-up' in the context of exercise?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — Define the term, state its purpose, then give practical steps and the physiological principles behind it.

Answer
A warm-up is a set of low‑to‑moderate intensity activities performed before more intense exercise to prepare the body and reduce injury risk.

Essential steps (working steps)
1. General aerobic phase (3–10 minutes): light jogging, brisk walking, cycling to raise heart rate and circulation.
2. Dynamic mobility and muscle activation (3–8 minutes): leg swings, arm circles, lunges, hip openers to increase joint range of motion and activate key muscles.
3. Sport- or activity‑specific drills (2–5 minutes): gradual rehearsal of movements you will perform (e.g., ball touches for soccer, easy lifts for weight training) increasing intensity toward the session’s demands.

Relevant concepts and principles
- Increased muscle temperature: warmer muscles contract more efficiently and are less prone to strain.
- Raised heart rate and blood flow: improves oxygen delivery and metabolic readiness.
- Nervous system activation: improves coordination, reaction time, and muscle recruitment.
- Gradual intensity progression: prepares the body without causing fatigue before the main workout.
- Injury prevention and performance enhancement: warm-ups lower injury risk and often improve subsequent performance.

Example (concise and practical)
For a 45‑minute run: 5 minutes brisk walk/light jog, 3 minutes dynamic leg swings and lunges, 2 minutes faster strides to approach race pace.

Logical reasoning summary
A warm-up gradually shifts the body from rest to exercise, addressing cardiovascular, muscular, and neural systems so the main activity can be performed more safely and effectively.

Explanation:
A warm-up is a set of light activities (for example brisk walking, easy jogging, or dynamic stretches) that gradually raise heart rate, increase blood flow and muscle temperature, and activate the nervous system. By doing this the body is better prepared for more intense exercise, which improves performance and reduces injury risk.

Question:
Which exercise is specifically mentioned for improving hand strength?

Options:


Correct Answer: Push-ups.

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — Identify which listed exercise places direct load and repetitive force through the hands and wrists, thereby improving hand strength.

Step 1 — Target muscles and action: Hand strength improves when an exercise requires the hands to support body weight or apply grip/pressure repeatedly. Such exercises produce both dynamic and isometric work in the wrists, forearms and hand muscles.

Step 2 — Match exercise to target: Push-ups require the hands to bear and push the body’s weight repeatedly, engaging the wrists, forearms and intrinsic hand muscles alongside chest and triceps. This direct loading and repeated force application make push-ups effective for improving hand strength.

Step 3 — Additional principle and enhancement: Progressive overload (more reps, added resistance or harder variants) increases strength. Variations like fingertip push-ups further concentrate force on the fingers and increase hand/grip strength.

Answer: Push-ups.

Explanation:
Push-ups are correct because they make your hands and wrists support and push your body weight, which works the wrists, forearms, and the muscles that stabilize the hand. Repeating this loaded pushing action builds muscle strength and endurance in the hands over time.

Question:
What is the significance of stretching before exercise?

Options:


Correct Answer: To prevent injuries during workouts.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — identify the physiological and mechanical effects of stretching and connect them to how those effects reduce injury risk.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Warm-up and blood flow: Stretching (as part of a warm-up) raises muscle temperature and increases blood flow to working muscles. Warmer muscles are more elastic and less prone to tears or strains.
2. Increased flexibility and range of motion: Regular stretching improves joint range of motion and muscle-tendon compliance, allowing movements to occur without excessive strain on tissues.
3. Neuromuscular priming: Dynamic stretching activates the nervous system and improves coordination and muscle recruitment patterns, helping muscles respond appropriately during exercise.
4. Load distribution and reduced overload: Better flexibility and controlled movement reduce abnormal loading on joints and soft tissues, lowering the chance of sprains, strains, and other workout injuries.

Practical note (applies to injury prevention):
- Use dynamic, sport-specific stretches before exercise (e.g., leg swings, walking lunges) to prepare muscles and nervous system.
- Use static stretching after exercise to help recovery and maintain flexibility.

Conclusion:
The primary significance of stretching before exercise is to reduce the risk of injuries during workouts by warming muscles, improving flexibility and joint mobility, and priming neuromuscular control.

Explanation:
Stretching before exercise helps warm up muscles, increase blood flow, and improve joint range of motion; these effects reduce muscle strains, sprains, and other injuries during workouts. By preparing the muscles and connective tissues to move safely, stretching lowers the risk of damage when you exercise.

Question:
What type of exercises are included in 'collective exercises'?

Options:


Correct Answer: Exercises performed together by a group.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach:
State the definition clearly, then justify why activities fall into this category and give a short illustrative example.

Steps and essential reasoning:
1. Define the term: Collective exercises are physical or mental activities carried out by multiple people at the same time with a shared objective (e.g., fitness, coordination, skill practice).
2. Identify key features: simultaneous participation, common goal or structure, interaction or coordination between participants.
3. Explain why an activity qualifies: if participants perform the same or complementary tasks together and benefit from group dynamics (motivation, feedback, teamwork), it is a collective exercise.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Group participation: more than one person engaged together.
- Shared objective: a common purpose (fitness, learning, rehearsal).
- Coordination and interaction: timing, roles, or mutual support often matter.

Example (brief, for clarity):
A team warm-up where all members perform the same stretching routine together is a collective exercise; a partner drill in sports where players take turns practicing passes is also collective because it requires coordinated interaction.

Final answer:
Collective exercises are exercises performed together by a group.

Explanation:
Collective exercises are activities carried out by a group at the same time, so the correct answer — "exercises performed together by a group" — is right. They focus on coordination, shared goals and synchronized practice (for example, team drills or group fitness classes), which distinguishes them from individual exercises.

Question:
How does exercise contribute to mental health according to the text?

Options:


Correct Answer: It helps relieve boredom and stress.

Solution:
সমাধান:
উত্তর পন্থা:
1. প্রথমে প্রশ্নের মূল বক্তব্য নির্ধারণ করা—টেক্সট অনুযায়ী ব্যায়াম কিভাবে মানসিক স্বাস্থ্যে সাহায্য করে তা নির্ণয় করা।
2. তারপর সেই বক্তব্যের বৈজ্ঞানিক ও ব্যবহারিক কারণগুলো ধাপে ধাপে উপস্থাপন করা।

ধাপগত কাজ ও যুক্তি:
1. ব্যায়ামকে মানসিক চাপ ও একঘেয়েমি কমানোর একটি কার্যকর উপায় হিসাবে টেক্সট উল্লেখ করেছে। এর অর্থ হচ্ছে ব্যায়াম মানসিক অবসাদ ও মনস্তাত্ত্বিক চাপ হ্রাসে সরাসরি অবদান রাখে।
2. কারণ (শরীরগত): নিয়মিত শারীরিক ক্রিয়াকলাপে [endorphins] ধরনের রাসায়নিক নিঃসরণ বেশি হয়, যা মুড উন্নত করে এবং ব্যথা বা দুঃখ কমায়। পাশাপাশি স্ট্রেস হরমোন [কোর্টিসল] স্তর হ্রাস পেতে পারে—এইগুলো মানসিক চাপ কমাতে সাহায্য করে।
3. কারণ (মানসিক/মনস্তাত্ত্বিক): ব্যায়াম মনকে উদ্বিগ্নতা থেকে অন্যদিকে মনোযোগ সরিয়ে দেয় (distraction), একঘেয়েমি ভাঙে এবং সৃজনশীলতা ও শক্তি বাড়ায়। নিয়মিত অর্জন/প্রগতি অনুভব আত্মবিশ্বাস বাড়ায়, যা মানসিক চাপ কমায়।
4. কারণ (সামাজিক ও জীবনধারা): গ্রুপ ব্যায়াম বা খেলাধুলা সামাজিক সংযোগ বাড়ায়, যা একাকীত্ব ও বোরডম কমায়। নিয়মিত শারীরিক সূচি একটি স্থিতিশীল রুটিন দেয়, মানসিক সুস্থতার জন্য সহায়ক।

উদাহরণ (সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে): প্রতিদিন ৩০ মিনিট দ্রুত হাঁটা বা হালকা দৌড় করলে মন সতেজ হয়, একঘেয়েমি দূর হয় এবং দিনের চাপ কমে—এটি টেক্সটের মূল বক্তব্যকে সমর্থন করে।

নিষ্কর্ষ:
টেক্সট অনুযায়ী ব্যায়াম মূলত একঘেয়েমি ও মানসিক চাপ উপশম করে—শরীরগত, মানসিক এবং সামাজিক বিভিন্ন প্রক্রিয়ার মাধ্যমে এটা ঘটায়।

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা: ব্যায়াম মনকে কাজে লাগিয়ে বিরক্তি কাটায় এবং শরীরে সুখদায়ক রাসায়নিক (এন্ডরফিন) বের করে স্ট্রেস কমায়। ফলে মেজাজ ভাল থাকে ও মানসিক চাপ হ্রাস পায়, যা মানসিক স্বাস্থ্যের জন্য উপকারী।

Question:
What is the recommended time to wait after eating before exercising?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- State the recommended wait time clearly, then explain the physiological reasons and practical exceptions so the recommendation is useful in real situations.

Clear answer:
- Wait at least two hours after a full or large meal before doing moderate-to-vigorous exercise.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Digestion and blood flow: After eating, blood is directed to the stomach and intestines to support digestion. Vigorous exercise also requires increased blood flow to working muscles. Exercising too soon forces the body to split circulation demands, which can impair digestion and performance.
2. Discomfort and risks: Starting exercise too quickly after a large meal increases the chance of gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, cramping, indigestion) and can reduce exercise efficiency.
3. Meal size and intensity matter: The “at least two hours” guideline applies to larger or heavier meals and to moderate-to-high intensity workouts. For light activity (walking, gentle stretching) you can often start sooner.
4. Practical exceptions:
   - Small snack (light carbohydrate or small snack): often acceptable after 20–60 minutes before light-to-moderate activity.
   - Very heavy or fatty meals: may require 2–3 hours for comfort.
   - Individual differences: personal tolerance varies; adjust based on how you feel.

Example (adds clarity):
- If you eat a substantial lunch at 12:00, plan vigorous exercise no earlier than about 14:00. If you have a small piece of fruit at 13:30, a light run or brisk walk by 14:00 may be fine.

Summary:
- Default recommendation: wait at least two hours after a full meal before exercising; shorten the wait after small snacks or for low-intensity activity, and lengthen it for very heavy meals or intense workouts.

Explanation:
Explanation: Wait at least two hours because a full meal requires time to move out of the stomach; exercising too soon diverts blood away from digestion and can cause cramps, nausea, or reflux. A light snack may need less time, but a full meal generally needs about two hours before moderate exercise.

Question:
What is a 'file' in the context of student assembly?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — identify the arrangement and contrast it with related terms.

1. Definition: A "file" in a student assembly is a single straight line of students standing one behind another, all facing the same direction.

2. Key identifying features (working steps):
   - Each student in the file stands directly behind the person in front.
   - The line is oriented front-to-back (longitudinal), not side-to-side.
   - Students in the same file maintain uniform spacing and alignment.

3. Relevant concepts and distinction:
   - File vs. rank: A "rank" (or row) is a line of students standing side by side (left to right). A "file" is the perpendicular line (front to back).
   - In drill and assembly organization, files (columns) and ranks (rows) are used together to form orderly formations.

4. Logical reasoning / significance:
   - Calling a group a file ensures clarity about positioning (who stands behind whom) and helps in counting, marching, and maintaining discipline.

5. Short example (adds value):
   - If there are 5 students in each file and 4 files, total students = [math]5 \times 4 = 20[/math]. Here each file has 5 students standing one behind another.

Answer: A file is a line of students standing one behind the other.

Explanation:
Explanation: In a school assembly, a "file" means a single straight line of students standing one behind another, so the correct answer describes this formation. Files help organize movement and maintain order because each student follows the person in front, unlike a "rank" where students stand side by side.

Question:
Which of the following is a rule for performing exercises correctly?

Options:


Correct Answer: Follow the specific techniques for each exercise.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer: Follow the specific techniques for each exercise.

Approach:
- Identify the rule: correct exercise performance depends on using the proper technique for each movement.
- Explain why: technique minimizes injury risk, maximizes effectiveness (targeting intended muscles), and allows safe progression.

Essential steps and principles:
1. Learn the technique first — get instruction from a qualified coach, trainer, or reliable source (video with good form cues).
2. Warm up before practicing the technique to prepare muscles and joints.
3. Maintain correct alignment and posture (spine neutral, joints tracking properly).
4. Use controlled tempo — avoid jerky or uncontrolled movements; control both concentric and eccentric phases.
5. Use an appropriate range of motion — full but safe range that preserves joint integrity.
6. Breathe correctly — exhale on effort, inhale on release (adjust per exercise).
7. Progress gradually — increase load, volume, or complexity only after mastering technique.
8. Modify when necessary — use regressions or assistive tools if unable to maintain form.
9. Seek feedback — mirrors, videos, or a coach help detect and correct faults.
10. Stop or adjust if sharp pain occurs — distinguish between normal effort and harmful pain.

Logical reasoning:
- Proper technique distributes load as intended; poor technique shifts stress to joints or unintended muscles, increasing injury risk and reducing training benefit.
- Mastering technique first prevents building bad movement patterns that are harder to correct later.

Examples (brief, added for clarity):
- Squat cue: keep chest up, neutral spine, knees tracking toes, sit back into hips — ensures load on glutes/quadriceps and protects knees/lower back.
- Push-up cue: body in straight line, scapula controlled, elbows at ~45° to body — targets chest/shoulders and protects shoulders.

Conclusion:
Following the specific techniques for each exercise is the fundamental rule because it ensures safety, effectiveness, and sustainable progress.

Question:
What is emphasized as important for students during physical activities?

Options:


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:

Answer: Discipline and teamwork.

Approach:
1. Identify the aims of physical activities — skill development, safety, fair play, and collective performance.
2. Determine the behaviours that support those aims. Discipline and teamwork directly enable safe, effective, and fair participation.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Discipline — students must follow rules, listen to instructions, maintain self-control, and adhere to safety procedures. This reduces injury risk, ensures orderly practice, and helps individuals focus on improving technique.
2. Teamwork — many physical activities are cooperative or competitive team events. Communication, trust, role acceptance, and coordinated effort allow the group to reach shared goals and perform better than isolated individuals.
3. Principles involved — responsibility (for oneself and others), respect (for teammates, opponents, and officials), cooperation (sharing tasks and supporting peers), and accountability (accepting roles and outcomes).
4. Expected outcomes — when students practice discipline and teamwork they show improved safety, higher skill acquisition, better game performance, stronger social skills, and positive attitudes toward physical activity.

Example (brief, illustrative): In a relay race, discipline means staying in your lane and following the exchange zone rules; teamwork means timing and executing smooth baton passes. Both are necessary for success and safety.

Conclusion: Emphasizing discipline and teamwork during physical activities promotes safety, performance, and personal and social development.

Explanation:
Discipline and teamwork are emphasized because physical activities need students to follow rules, listen to instructions, and cooperate so everyone stays safe and the activity proceeds smoothly. Discipline helps individuals control effort and practice regularly, while teamwork develops communication and coordination needed to achieve shared goals.

Question:
Which exercise is mentioned for improving flexibility?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
প্রশ্নের উদ্দেশ্য বুঝে উত্তর পেতে প্রথমে দেখতে হবে কোন ব্যায়াম সরাসরি শরীরের নমনশীলতা (flexibility) বাড়ায়। সরল বিশ্লেষণে যে ব্যায়ামটি সরাসরি পেশী ও সংযোগকারী টিস্যুকে প্রসারিত করে, সেটিই নমনশীলতা বৃদ্ধির জন্য উপযোগী।

উপযুক্ত ব্যায়াম ও যুক্তি:
- উল্লিখিত ব্যায়াম: শরীর সামনে দিকে বাঁকানো (Body bending forward) — এটি প্রধানত হ্যামস্ট্রিং, নিতম্বের পেশী এবং নিম্ন পিঠের পেশীকে টেনে প্রসারিত করে। এই পেশীগুলো সচল হলে কোমর ও পায়ের মোট রেঞ্জ অফ মোশন বাড়ে, ফলে সামগ্রিক নমনশীলতা উন্নত হয়।
- মূল নীতি: ধারাবাহিক স্ট্রেচিং পেশীর অতিরিক্ত অভিযোজনে টিস্যু দীর্ঘ হয় এবং নার্ভাল রিল্যাক্সেশন ঘটে; ফলে গতিসীমা (range of motion) বৃদ্ধি পায়।

কর্মপদ্ধতি (পদ্ধতিগত ধাপ):
1. খাড়া অবস্থায় পা কাঁধ-প্রস্থে রাখুন, হাঁটুর দিক একটু নরম রাখুন।  
2. কোমর থেকে সামনে হিপ দিয়ে হেলে যান — ভাঁজ শুধুমাত্র কোমর থেকে করুন, পিঠ গোচানো নয়।  
3. হাত পায়ের দিকে পৌঁছানোর চেষ্টা করুন; যদি পা স্পষ্ট না হয় তবে হাঁটুর সামান্য বাঁক রেখে চলুন।  
4. স্বাভাবিকভাবে শ্বাস নিন এবং প্রতিটি স্ট্রেচ 15–30 সেকেন্ড ধরে রাখুন।  
5. ধীরগতিতে ফিরে আসুন এবং 2–3 বার 반복 করুন।  

সতর্কতা ও পরিমার্জন:
- ঝাঁপিয়ে বা জোর করে টানবেন না (no bouncing)।  
- নিম্ন পিঠে তীব্র ব্যথা থাকলে ডাক্তারের পরামর্শ নিন বা হাঁটু সামান্য বাঁকিয়ে করুন।  
- নিয়মিত অনুশীলন এবং ধীর প্রগতি নমনশীলতা বাড়ায়; প্রতিদিন বা অন্তত সাপ্তাহিক কয়েকবার করা উত্তম।

সংক্ষিপ্ত উপসংহার:
শরীর সামনে বাঁকানো (Body bending forward) সরাসরি পেশী প্রসারিত করে এবং নিয়মিত প্রয়োগে নমনশীলতা উন্নত করে — তাই এটি নমনশীলতা বাড়ানোর উপযুক্ত ব্যায়াম।

Explanation:
Body bending forward directly stretches the hamstrings, lower back and hip muscles, which are key for trunk and leg flexibility. Regularly performing and holding this stretch increases muscle length and joint range of motion, improving overall flexibility.

Question:
What is the purpose of the oath taken during the assembly?

Options:


Correct Answer: To instill loyalty and commitment to the country.

Solution:
Solution:

Approach:
1. Identify what an oath in an assembly means (a formal, public promise).
2. Examine the functions such a oath serves (legal, moral, psychological, and social).
3. Connect those functions to the stated purpose: instilling loyalty and commitment to the country.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Definition: An oath in an assembly is a formal declaration by members (e.g., legislators, officials) to perform duties faithfully and uphold the constitution and laws. Because it is public and solemn, it carries symbolic and legal weight.
2. Legal and institutional function: The oath creates a binding obligation—often backed by law or rules—that obliges the taker to follow constitutional duties and to be accountable for breaches. This reinforces commitment to national institutions and the rule of law.
3. Moral and psychological function: Saying an oath aloud in public fosters personal resolve and a sense of duty. Public commitment increases internal motivation to act loyally because violating the oath would cause reputational and ethical consequences.
4. Social and political function: The ceremony signals to citizens that representatives prioritize the nation’s interests. It builds public trust and reinforces collective identity, making loyalty to the country an explicit expectation of office.
5. Mechanism: By combining legal obligation, moral commitment, and public accountability, the oath converts abstract allegiance into an explicit, enforceable promise—thereby instilling loyalty and commitment to the country.

Concise example (illustrative): When new members of a parliament swear to uphold the constitution, they legally commit to constitutional duties, publicly affirm their loyalty, and become accountable to voters and colleagues—demonstrating how an oath promotes national commitment.

Conclusion:
The primary purpose of the oath taken during the assembly is to instill and formalize loyalty and commitment to the country by creating legal obligation, fostering moral resolve, and providing public accountability.

Question:
What is a common misconception about exercising without equipment?

Options:


Correct Answer: That it's impossible to exercise effectively.

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
- State the misconception clearly and then examine principles of effective training to show why it is incorrect.
- Show practical ways to make bodyweight exercise effective using training variables (intensity, volume, progression).

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Define the misconception:
   - The mistaken belief: “Exercising without equipment is impossible to exercise effectively.” This implies bodyweight work cannot build strength, endurance, or fitness.

2. Apply exercise principles to test the claim:
   - Progressive overload: For gains, the body must face gradually increasing demand. This can be achieved without equipment by changing leverage, tempo, repetitions, sets, rest, and exercise difficulty.
   - Specificity and overload are not tied to external weights; they depend on relative intensity and stimulus applied to muscle and nervous system.
   - Adaptation mechanisms (neuromuscular improvements, metabolic stress, time under tension) operate with bodyweight exercises too.

3. Show how to manipulate variables without equipment:
   - Increase mechanical difficulty: e.g., regular push-up → incline/decline push-up → archer push-up → one-arm push-up.
   - Increase intensity with plyometrics: e.g., squat → jump squat → tuck jump to add power demands.
   - Increase time under tension or change tempo: slow negatives, paused reps, or slow single-leg squats.
   - Change volume and density: more sets/reps, shorter rest, circuit style to increase cardiovascular and metabolic load.
   - Use unilateral movements and leverage to raise load per limb (e.g., pistol squats, single-leg Romanian deadlift).

4. Examples that illustrate effectiveness (brief and purposeful):
   - Strength progression: push-ups (3×12) → decline push-ups (3×8) → one-arm negatives to build toward one-arm push-up.
   - Hypertrophy/endurance: higher-rep squats with slow tempo and short rest to create metabolic stress.

5. Conclusion (logical summary):
   - The misconception is false because the key training principles (progressive overload, specificity, progressive difficulty) can be satisfied without equipment.
   - Bodyweight training can produce meaningful strength, hypertrophy, endurance, and power gains when programmed progressively and varied properly.

Practical takeaway:
- Don’t assume equipment is required; instead, plan progression (difficulty, volume, tempo, rest) and track performance to ensure continuous improvement.

Explanation:
Because people often equate equipment with effectiveness, they assume exercising without equipment can't give real results. In reality bodyweight workouts (push-ups, squats, planks, jumps) can be scaled and progressed by changing repetitions, tempo, leverage or exercise variations to build strength, endurance and power—so you can train effectively without machines or weights.

Question:
How is 'jogging' defined in the text?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — locate the sentence or phrase in the text that explains what "jogging" means, note the key words describing pace and purpose, and restate the definition clearly.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify context: the text contrasts different types of motion or exercise and explicitly describes "jogging."
2. Extract key attributes: the text calls it a "slow run" and gives its purpose as to "warm up the body."
3. Combine attributes to form the definition: since both pace (slow) and purpose (warming up) are stated, the concise meaning is a slow-paced run intended to warm the body before more intense activity.

Relevant concept:
- Jogging is distinguished from faster running by lower intensity and from walking by a running gait; its typical role is preparatory (warm-up) rather than high-intensity training.

Final answer:
Jogging = a slow run to warm up the body.

Example (brief, optional): an athlete may jog for 5–10 minutes before practicing sprints to raise heart rate and loosen muscles.

Explanation:
The correct answer is right because jogging means running at a slow, steady pace to raise heart rate and warm up muscles. This gentle effort prepares the body for harder exercise and helps reduce the risk of injury.

Question:
What is the effect of regular physical activity on students?

Options:


Correct Answer: It promotes a healthy lifestyle.

Solution:
সমাধান:
উত্তর পদ্ধতি: প্রথমে "নিয়মিত শারীরিক ক্রিয়াকলাপ" কী বোঝায় সংজ্ঞায়িত করা হবে, তারপরে সেগুলোর সরাসরি এবং পরোক্ষ প্রভাবগুলো যুক্তিযুক্তভাবে উপস্থাপন করা হবে, শেষে একটি সারসংক্ষেপ দেওয়া হবে।

ধাপ ১ — সংজ্ঞা ও ধরণ:
নিয়মিত শারীরিক ক্রিয়াকলাপ বলতে দৈনন্দিন বা সাপ্তাহিকভাবে পুনরাবৃত্তি করে করা হাঁটা, দৌড়ানো, সাইক্লিং, খেলাধুলো, যোগব্যায়াম ইত্যাদি বোঝায়।

ধাপ ২ — মূল ধারণা ও নীতি (কার্যপ্রণালি):
- শারীরিক দিক: নিয়মিত ব্যায়াম হৃদপিণ্ড ও ফুসফুসের কার্যক্ষমতা বাড়ায়, পেশী ও হাড় শক্তিশালী করে এবং শরীরের ওজন নিয়ন্ত্রণে সাহায্য করে। এর ফলে রোগপ্রতিরোধ ক্ষমতা ও সার্বিক শারীরিক সুস্থতা বৃদ্ধি পায়।  
- মানসিক ও স্নায়ুবৈজ্ঞানিক দিক: ব্যায়াম মস্তিষ্কে এন্ডোরফিন ও সেরোটোনিনের নিঃসরণ বাড়ায়, যেগুলো চাপ কমায়, মেজাজ ভালো করে এবং উদ্বেগ-উদাসীনতা হ্রাস করে। এছাড়া মনোযোগ ও স্মৃতিশক্তি উন্নত হয়, ফলে শিক্ষাগত কার্যকারিতা বাড়ে।  
- সামাজিক ও আচরণগত দিক: খেলাধুলা ও দলগত অনুশীলন সময়মেনে কাজ করা, নিয়মিততা, সহযোগিতা ও আত্মনিয়ন্ত্রণ শেখায় — এগুলো সুস্থ জীবনযাপনের অভ্যাস গঠনে সহায়ক।

ধাপ ৩ — যুক্তি ও উদাহরণগত প্রভাব:
যখন একজন ছাত্র নিয়মিত প্রতিদিন আধা ঘণ্টা হাটা বা সপ্তাহে কয়েকদিন খেলাধুলা করে, তখন তার শারীরিক শক্তি ও মনোসংযোগ বাড়ে; ক্লাসে বোঝার ক্ষমতা বাড়ায় এবং ক্লান্তি কমে। দীর্ঘমেয়াদে এই অভ্যাস হৃদরোগ, ডায়াবেটিস ও স্থূলতার ঝুঁকি কমায় — ফলে সাধারণভাবে সুস্থ জীবনযাপন সম্ভব হয়।

সারসংক্ষেপ:
নিয়মিত শারীরিক ক্রিয়াকলাপ ছাত্র-ছাত্রীদের শারীরিক, মানসিক ও সামাজিক দিক থেকে সুস্থ রাখে এবং রোগপ্রতিরোধ ক্ষমতা ও শিক্ষাগত কার্যকারিতা উন্নত করে — ফলে এটি একটি সুস্থ জীবনধারা প্রচার করে।

Explanation:
Regular physical activity improves physical fitness (stronger muscles, healthier heart, better weight control) and mental well‑being (less stress, more energy), so students adopt habits that reduce disease risk and support everyday functioning. Because these lasting benefits—better health, mood, and routines—are the core of a healthy lifestyle, regular exercise promotes a healthy way of living.

Question:
What type of exercise is 'sit-ups' primarily used for?

Options:


Correct Answer: Strengthening abdominal muscles.

Solution:
সমাধান:

উত্তরসংক্ষেপ: sit-ups মূলত পেটের পেশী (abdominal muscles) শক্তিশালী করার জন্য ব্যবহৃত একটি শক্তি-বর্ধক (strengthening/core) ব্যায়াম।

উত্তর প্রদানের পদ্ধতি:
1. প্রশ্ন বিশ্লেষণ: sit-ups কী এবং কীভাবে করা হয় বুঝব—তার পর দেখে নিব কোন পেশীগুলো সক্রিয় হয়।
2. মৌলিক নীতিগুলো প্রয়োগ করব—যেমন পেশীর সঙ্কোচন (contraction), স্পাইনার ফ্লেক্সশন ইত্যাদি—তার মাধ্যমে উদ্দেশ্য নির্ণয় করা হবে।

পদক্ষেপভিত্তিক ব্যাখ্যা:
1. ক্রিয়া-প্রক্রিয়া: sit-up করলে শরীরের উপরের অংশ কাঁচি করে তুলে বক্ষদেহ পেটের দিকে নড়ায়—এই সময়ে পেটের সামনের পেশীগুলো (বিশেষত rectus abdominis) সম্মুখ অভিমুখে সংকুচিত হয়।
2. পেশী লক্ষ্য: মূলত rectus abdominis কাজ করে; পাশাপাশি internal ও external obliques এবং transverse abdominis সহ কর (core) পেশীগুলো সক্রিয় থাকে।
3. ব্যায়ামের ধরণ: পুনরাবৃত্তি করে ভারবন বা শরীরকে নিজের ওজনের বিপরীতে কাজ করানো হয়—এটি শক্তি/বল বৃদ্ধি করার একটি রোধী ধরনের (resistance/strength) ব্যায়াম, যা কোর স্থিতিশীলতাও উন্নত করে।
4. নীতিগত সমর্থন: স্পেসিফিসিটি (specificity) নীতির মতে, যদি উদ্দেশ্য পেটের পেশী শক্ত করা হয়, তাহলে sit-ups উপযুক্ত; অতিরিক্ত উন্নতির জন্য ওভারলোড ও প্রগ্রেসিভ রেসিস্ট্যান্স প্রয়োগ করা যায়।

সংক্ষিপ্ত উপসংহার: তাই sit-ups প্রধানত পেটের পেশী শক্তিশালী করার (strengthening abdominal muscles) ব্যায়াম।

Explanation:
Sit-ups primarily strengthen the abdominal muscles because the movement repeatedly flexes the spine and brings the torso toward the knees, causing strong contractions of the rectus abdominis and engagement of the obliques and other core muscles. Repeating this action builds strength and endurance in the core, improving trunk stability.

Question:
What is the expected behavior of students during the assembly?

Options:


Correct Answer: To stand in line and follow instructions.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — identify the purpose of an assembly (order, safety, communication) and list the specific, expected behaviors that achieve those purposes.

Essential steps and expected behaviors:
1. Arrive on time and move to the assembly area calmly.
2. Stand in line in assigned order or class groups, keeping space and formation intact.
3. Maintain silence or speak only when permitted so announcements and instructions are heard.
4. Face the flag/stage or the person speaking and pay attention to announcements, speeches, or ceremonies.
5. Follow supervisors’ or teachers’ instructions promptly (e.g., when to sit, sing, march, or leave).
6. Show respect and decorum (stand straight during anthems, avoid disruptive actions).
7. Leave in an orderly manner when dismissed, keeping lines and directions as instructed.

Relevant concepts and reasoning:
- Discipline and cooperation: Standing in line and following instructions create predictable behavior so the assembly runs smoothly.
- Safety and accountability: Ordered lines make it easier to do roll calls, spot absentees, and evacuate quickly if needed.
- Communication efficiency: Silence and attention ensure everyone receives the same information and instructions.
- Respect and school culture: Proper conduct during assemblies reinforces respect for the institution, peers, and speakers.

Short example for clarity: if all students stand in line and listen, announcements can be made once and understood by everyone, reducing confusion and saving time.

Final concise answer: Students are expected to stand in line and follow instructions.

Explanation:
This is correct because assemblies require order and safety, so students should stand in line to keep movement calm and organized. Following instructions helps the program run smoothly, shows respect to teachers and classmates, and keeps everyone safe.

Question:
Which of the following is a key component of a successful exercise routine?

Options:


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — identify why “consistency and proper technique” is central by defining both terms, stating underlying exercise principles, then showing how they produce successful outcomes.

Step 1 — Definitions
- Consistency: performing exercise regularly over time with appropriate frequency and progression (habit formation and repeated stimulus).
- Proper technique: executing movements with correct form and alignment to target intended muscles and minimize injury.

Step 2 — Relevant concepts and principles
- Progressive overload: gradual increase in stress (weight, reps, duration) is needed for adaptation; this requires consistency to accumulate stimulus.
- Specificity: adaptations follow the type of training performed, so correct technique ensures you train the intended systems/muscles.
- Recovery and adaptation: frequent, consistent training balanced with rest allows biological systems to adapt.
- Injury prevention: proper technique reduces excessive joint stress and compensatory patterns that cause setbacks.

Step 3 — Logical reasoning (why these are key)
- Without consistency, adaptations (strength, endurance, skill) cannot accumulate; occasional effort yields little long-term change.
- Without proper technique, even consistent practice can be inefficient or harmful: poor form limits loading safely, reduces transfer to goals, and increases injury risk that disrupts training.
- Together they enable safe, progressive, specific improvements and sustain long-term adherence.

Step 4 — Short illustrative example (adds value)
- Person A trains squats consistently but with poor form → short-term strength may rise but risk of knee/back injury increases, causing interruptions.
- Person B trains squats consistently with correct form and gradual overload → steady strength gains, fewer injuries, better long-term progress.

Conclusion
Consistency and proper technique are key components because they produce the repeated, correctly targeted, and safe stimulus required for reliable, long-term improvements in fitness.

Explanation:
Consistency ensures regular training and gradual improvement through progressive overload and habit formation, while proper technique makes each exercise effective and reduces risk of injury; মিলিতভাবে এগুলোই নিরাপদ ও স্থায়ী ফলাফল দেয়।

Question:
What is the importance of social skills gained through sports?

Options:


Correct Answer: They help in teamwork and leadership.

Solution:
সমাধান:

উত্তরধারণা:
ক্রীড়ার মাধ্যমে যে সামাজিক দক্ষতা অর্জিত হয়—যেমন যোগাযোগ, সহযোগিতা, দায়বদ্ধতা, এবং সমস্যা সমাধানের ভাব—তারা সরাসরি দলগত কাজ ও নেতৃত্ব গঠনে সহায়তা করে। নিচে ধাপে ধাপে ব্যাখ্যা করা হল।

ধাপ ১: সামাজিক দক্ষতা সনাক্ত করা
- ক্রীড়া অনুশীলনে খেলোয়াড়রা শিখে পরিষ্কারভাবে কথা বলা, সংকেত পাঠানো, একে‑অপরের অনুভূতি বোঝা এবং সময়মতো সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়া।  
- এগুলো হলো মৌলিক সামাজিক দক্ষতা: যোগাযোগ, সহযোগিতা, বিশ্বাস, সহনশীলতা এবং দায়িত্বগ্রহণ।

ধাপ ২: দলগত কাজ (teamwork) উন্নয়নে সংযোগ স্থাপন
- যখন সদস্যরা স্পষ্টভাবে যোগাযোগ করে ও একে‑অপরের ভূমিকাকে সম্মান করে, কাজগুলোর সমন্বয় হয় এবং লক্ষ্য সহজে অর্জিত হয়।  
- উদাহরণ: ফুটবল বা ব্যাডমিন্টনের ডাবলসে সঠিক সংকেত ও ভদ্র আচরণ থাকলে বল/পোস্টে সমন্বয় বৃদ্ধি পায় এবং দলগত ফল ভালো হয়।

ধাপ ৩: নেতৃত্ব (leadership) গঠনে ভূমিকা ব্যাখ্যা
- ক্রীড়া নেতৃত্ব প্রশিক্ষণ দেয়: সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়া, সংকট সময়ে দিকনির্দেশনা দেওয়া, সদস্যদের উৎসাহিত করা এবং দায়‑দায়িত্ব ভাগ করা।  
- একজন ভালো ক্রীড়াজনিত নেতা দলকে অনুপ্রাণিত করে, কৌশল ঠিক করে এবং সমস্যা সমাধানে সহায়তা করে—ফলে দলগত কর্মক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধি পায়।

যুক্তি (logical reasoning):
- সামাজিক দক্ষতা এবং কার্যকর যোগাযোগ ছাড়া কোনো দল সমন্বিতভাবে কাজ করতে পারে না; ফলে ক্রীড়া থেকে পাওয়া এই দক্ষতাগুলো বাস্তবে কর্মক্ষেত্রে বা শিক্ষাজীবনে দলগত কাজে সরাসরি প্রযোজ্য।  
- নেতৃত্ব গঠনের ক্ষেত্রেও ক্রীড়ার পরিবেশ নিরাপদ পরীক্ষা‑মাঠ যেখানে অসফলতা থেকে শিখে দায়িত্ব নেওয়া ও অন্যকে পরিচালনা করার ক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধি পায়।

সংক্ষিপ্ত উদাহরণ (সামান্য প্রাসঙ্গিক):
- একটি রিলে দৌড়ে টিমওয়ার্ক প্রয়োজন—বাতন সঠিকভাবে হস্তান্তর করতে হলে বিশ্বাস ও সময়াঙ্কন দরকার; একই দক্ষতা কার্যকরী দলের মধ্যে দায়িত্ববোধ ও সমন্বয় তৈরিতেও লাগে।  

উপসংহার:
ক্রীড়া থেকে অর্জিত সামাজিক দক্ষতা দলগত কাজকে মজবুত করে এবং নেতৃত্ব গঠনে সহায়তা করে—এই কারণেই এগুলো অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ।

Explanation:
Playing sports teaches communication, cooperation, and how to handle conflicts, which makes working effectively in a team easier. Regular team play also builds confidence, decision‑making and the habit of guiding or motivating others, all key to leadership.

Question:
What should students do if they feel tired during exercises?

Options:


Correct Answer: Take a break and hydrate.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — If a student feels tired during exercise, they should stop the activity briefly and drink fluids to recover before continuing. This minimizes risk and helps restore performance.

Essential working steps:
1. Pause the exercise immediately and sit or stand calmly to avoid injury.  
2. Hydrate with small, steady sips of water or a suitable sports drink (especially after long or intense sessions). Avoid gulping large amounts at once.  
3. Rest and monitor symptoms for 5–15 minutes: check breathing, heart rate, dizziness, and how muscles feel. Do gentle stretching or deep breathing to aid recovery.  
4. Decide whether to resume gradually (lighter intensity) or stop for the day. If symptoms are severe or do not improve (fainting, chest pain, severe breathlessness), seek medical help.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Fatigue often results from energy depletion, muscle fatigue, or dehydration.  
- Hydration helps maintain blood volume, temperature regulation, and nutrient delivery to muscles.  
- Short rest lowers heart rate and allows the body to recover homeostasis before continuing.

Logical reasoning:
Stopping prevents accidents and gives the body time to recover; sipping fluids replenishes lost water and electrolytes, which often underlie feelings of tiredness. Monitoring symptoms ensures safety and guides whether to resume activity.

Brief example (only for clarity): If you feel tired during a 30-minute run, stop, sit for 5–10 minutes, drink about 150–300 ml of water in small sips, check how you feel, then resume at a slower pace if recovered.

Explanation:
When you feel tired, your body shows signs of fatigue that reduce performance and increase risk of injury, so a short break lets your breathing and muscles recover. Drinking water replaces fluids lost in sweat, prevents dehydration, and helps you regain energy and focus before continuing.

Question:
What is a potential consequence of excessive exercise?

Options:


Correct Answer: Fatigue and decreased performance.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer: A common consequence of excessive exercise is fatigue and decreased performance.

Approach:
1. Define the condition: "Excessive exercise" means training volume or intensity that consistently exceeds the body’s capacity to recover.
2. Identify immediate and cumulative effects that lead to the stated consequence.

Essential steps and reasoning:
- Step 1 — Acute energy deficit: Repeated high-intensity or long-duration sessions deplete muscle glycogen and ATP stores. Without adequate replenishment, muscles cannot generate the same force, causing early-onset fatigue.
- Step 2 — Tissue damage and insufficient repair: Exercise causes microscopic muscle damage. If recovery time is insufficient, damage accumulates, reducing strength and increasing soreness, which lowers performance.
- Step 3 — Central nervous system (CNS) fatigue: Prolonged overload can impair neuromuscular signaling and motivation, producing feelings of tiredness and reduced coordination.
- Step 4 — Hormonal and immune effects: Chronic excessive training can raise catabolic hormones (e.g., cortisol), lower anabolic hormones (e.g., testosterone), and suppress immunity — all contributing to persistent fatigue and poorer performance.
- Conclusion: These combined physiological and neurological changes explain why excessive exercise commonly produces fatigue and a drop in athletic or functional performance.

Relevant concept summary:
- Overtraining/overreaching spectrum: short-term overreaching may be reversible with rest; chronic overtraining leads to sustained fatigue and performance decline.
- Recovery is essential: adequate rest, nutrition, sleep, and periodization prevent the fatigue → decreased performance outcome.

Example (brief): A runner who increases weekly mileage sharply without extra rest may feel constantly tired, run slower times, and have prolonged muscle soreness — illustrating fatigue and decreased performance from excessive exercise.

Explanation:
Excessive exercise leads to fatigue and decreased performance because it depletes the body’s energy stores, causes muscle microdamage and metabolic waste buildup, and doesn’t allow adequate recovery. ফলত শক্তি, সহনশীলতা এবং কৌশলে পতন হয়।

Question:
What is the recommended frequency of physical exercise for students?

Options:


Correct Answer: Regularly, as part of daily activities.

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach — short direct answer:
- Students should exercise regularly, ideally as part of their daily routine.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Define “regularly”: For children and adolescents, health authorities (WHO, CDC) recommend about 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. For older students/adults, a practical target is at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days per week. Regular means spread across the week rather than all at once.
2. Why daily/regular activity matters:
   - Habit formation: daily practice makes exercise a lasting habit.
   - Health benefits: regular activity improves cardiovascular fitness, mental health, concentration, and academic performance.
   - Accumulation: shorter activity bouts (e.g., 10–20 minutes) add up to the daily target, making it easier to fit into a student’s schedule.
3. How to implement (practical steps):
   - Schedule short active periods during the day (walk/bike to school, active breaks between study sessions, PE class, team sports, or home workouts).
   - Vary activities: aerobic (running, brisk walking), strength (bodyweight exercises), and bone-strengthening (jumping, skipping).
   - Monitor and adjust: aim for consistency, increase intensity/duration gradually, and rest when needed.

Useful examples (brief):
- A student can do three 20-minute brisk walks or play sports for 60 minutes to meet the daily recommendation.
- University students can do 30 minutes of moderate exercise five days a week, plus two short strength sessions.

Conclusion:
- Recommended frequency: regular, preferably daily activity incorporated into everyday life to meet age-appropriate targets and gain sustained health and academic benefits.

Explanation:
Regular physical activity should be done regularly and integrated into daily routines because consistency builds cardiovascular fitness, strength, mood and concentration. Making exercise a daily habit (short walks, stretching, sports or active breaks) helps students stay healthy, alert and better able to learn.

Question:
What is the role of music during physical activities?

Options:


Correct Answer: To motivate and energize participants.

Solution:
Solution:

Answer approach:
State the primary role, then explain the mechanisms (psychological and physiological) by which music performs that role, and give brief examples showing how it applies during different physical activities.

Steps and reasoning:
1. State the role clearly:
   - The role of music during physical activities is to motivate and energize participants.

2. Explain psychological mechanisms:
   - Arousal and mood regulation: Upbeat music increases arousal and positive mood, which raises willingness to exercise.
   - Distraction from discomfort: Music diverts attention from fatigue and pain, lowering perceived exertion (people feel they can work harder/longer).
   - Motivation through lyrics and associations: Motivational words or familiar, enjoyable songs trigger goal-focused behavior and persistence.

3. Explain physiological and performance effects:
   - Tempo and rhythm synchronization: A steady beat helps synchronize movement (e.g., cadence in running or cycling), improving economy and consistency of effort.
   - Neurochemical effects: Music can increase dopamine and reduce stress hormones, producing feelings of reward and reduced effort perception, which supports sustained activity.

4. Apply to practical examples (brief and relevant):
   - High-tempo music (e.g., 120–140 bpm) for cardio or high-intensity interval training to raise energy and cadence.
   - Steady mid-tempo tracks for endurance activities to maintain consistent pace and reduce perceived exertion.
   - Strong, motivational tracks for short, intense lifting sessions to boost focus and power.

Relevant concepts and principles:
- Perceived exertion: Music lowers the subjective sense of effort, enabling higher performance.
- Rhythmic entrainment: The body naturally syncs movements to external rhythms, improving efficiency.
- Arousal regulation: Appropriate music adjusts physiological arousal to match the demands of the activity.

Conclusion:
Music motivates and energizes participants by improving mood and arousal, distracting from fatigue, synchronizing movement, and producing neurochemical effects that support higher effort and better performance.

Explanation:
Music motivates and energizes participants by raising arousal and improving mood, making exercise feel more enjoyable. A steady beat also helps synchronize movement and can lower perceived exertion, so people push harder and sustain activity longer.

Question:
Which of the following is a benefit of participating in team sports?

Options:


Correct Answer: Learning to cooperate with others.

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach:
Identify the core social and practical processes that occur in team sports and link them to the stated benefit: learning to cooperate with others.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Shared goal and interdependence:
   - In team sports every player pursues a common objective (e.g., score, defend). This creates interdependence: an individual's success depends on coordinated actions of teammates.
   - Logical consequence: players must align actions and timing, which requires cooperation.

2. Defined roles and coordination:
   - Teams assign positions and roles (attacker, defender, goalkeeper). Fulfilling a role effectively means cooperating so others can perform theirs.
   - Practising set plays and tactics develops habits of coordinated behavior.

3. Communication and feedback:
   - Effective cooperation needs clear communication (verbal signals, gestures) and ongoing feedback during practice and matches.
   - Regular communication builds trust and reduces errors, reinforcing cooperative skills.

4. Conflict resolution and mutual support:
   - Competitive scenarios generate mistakes and disagreements. Team sports force players to resolve conflicts, forgive errors, and support one another—essential elements of cooperation.

5. Repetition and social learning:
   - Repeated practices and games provide opportunities to learn cooperative norms (turn-taking, sharing responsibility, collective problem-solving).
   - Coaches and teammates model cooperative behavior, which players adopt.

Relevant concepts/principles:
- Social interdependence theory: positive interdependence promotes cooperation.
- Role specialization: cooperation arises when members accept complementary roles.
- Communication theory: information exchange is necessary for coordinated action.
- Experiential learning: doing together builds cooperative skills more effectively than isolated instruction.

Example (concise and illustrative):
- In soccer, a striker must time runs based on a midfielder’s pass. The midfielder delays or speeds up a pass depending on the striker’s position and a defender’s movement. Success requires anticipating teammates’ actions, signaling when to move, and adjusting—concrete practice of cooperation.

Conclusion:
All these mechanisms show why a primary benefit of participating in team sports is learning to cooperate with others.

Question:
What is an example of a bodyweight exercise mentioned in the text?

Options:


Correct Answer: Push-ups.

Solution:
Solution:
Approach — identify exercises in the text that use the person’s own body as resistance. A bodyweight exercise requires no external equipment and relies on gravity and body mass.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Define the principle: a bodyweight exercise uses the exerciser’s own body weight to provide resistance for movement and strength-building.
2. Scan the text for named movements that fit this definition (no weights or machines mentioned).
3. Verify the example: “push-ups” are described without any equipment and involve lifting and lowering the body using arm and core muscles — therefore they meet the definition.

Brief working steps to perform a push-up (shows why it’s bodyweight-based):
- Start in a high plank position with hands under shoulders and body in a straight line.
- Lower the chest toward the floor by bending the elbows while keeping the core tight.
- Push back up to the starting position, using the arms, chest, and core to lift the body.

Relevant concepts:
- Resistance source: body mass and gravity.
- Primary muscles worked: chest (pectorals), triceps, shoulders, and core.
- Progression principles: change repetitions, tempo, or variation (e.g., incline/decline) to increase difficulty.

Answer: Push-ups.

Explanation:
Explanation: Push-ups are a bodyweight exercise because you use your own body weight as the resistance while pushing your body up and down. This requires no external weights and works muscles like the chest, shoulders, triceps and core.
