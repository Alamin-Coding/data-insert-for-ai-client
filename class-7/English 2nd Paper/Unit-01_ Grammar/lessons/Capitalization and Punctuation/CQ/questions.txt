Question:
Rewrite the following passage using capitalization and punctuation.

he said i can chop some wood today i said but i have a boy coming from the orphanage im the boy you but you're small size doesn't matter chopping wood he said

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
He said, "I can chop some wood today."

I said, "But I have a boy coming from the orphanage."

"I'm the boy."

"You? But you're small."

"Size doesn't matter chopping wood," he said.

Explanation:
The correct version capitalizes the first word of each sentence and the pronoun "I", and uses commas, periods, quotation marks, and an apostrophe to separate speakers and end statements so the meaning is clear. Proper punctuation breaks the run-on text into distinct spoken lines and clauses (for example, commas after "said", periods to end sentences, and "I'm" with an apostrophe), which shows who is speaking and what each person means.

This is correct because each spoken sentence begins with a capital letter and proper noun "Facebook" is capitalized; a question mark ends the question; quotation marks enclose speech and commas separate the dialogue tags from the quoted sentences.

help me out he called to the magician my dear boy the man replied you had better first give me the lamp and lighten your load it is not the lamp that weighs me down answered aladin but lend me a hand as soon as i reach the ground i will give it to you

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:

Explanation:
The corrected version capitalizes the first word of each sentence and the proper name "Aladin," and it uses quotation marks to mark the magician's and Aladin's spoken words. Commas separate dialogue tags from the speech (for example, "he called to the magician," "the man replied,") and periods end sentences so the meaning and sentence boundaries become clear.

Explanation: The corrections use capitalization at the start of each sentence and appropriate punctuation (periods and a comma) to separate complete ideas and clauses. A reflexive pronoun ("himself") and the conjunction "and" were added for grammatical clarity. Proper punctuation and capitalization make the meaning clear and the sentence structure correct.

Question:
Rewrite the following passage using capitalization and punctuation.

are you brothers the mistress of the house said turning to the dervishes no by allah they said we are poor wanderers who met by mere chance we pray for allah's pardon

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Are you brothers?" the mistress of the house said, turning to the dervishes. "No, by Allah," they said, "we are poor wanderers who met by mere chance. We pray for Allah's pardon."

Explanation:
Capitalization rules require starting each sentence and proper nouns like "Allah" with a capital letter, and punctuation must mark quoted speech and sentence boundaries (question mark for a question, commas to set off tags, apostrophe for possession). So the passage is corrected by placing quotation marks around the spoken lines, using a question mark after "Are you brothers?", commas to offset the speaker tags, and an apostrophe in "Allah's" to show possession.

Explanation:
"What kind of stories did Aesop tell?" said Anwar. "Fables," replied Mrs. Amin. "Do you know what fables are?" "No," I replied. "Well," continued Mrs. Amin, "fables are stories with a message or a moral."

This is correct because each sentence and proper name is capitalized, questions end with question marks, and spoken words are enclosed in quotation marks with appropriate commas and periods for dialogue tags.

Explanation:

"A thousand guilders," said the Pied Piper.  
"All right," said the mayor. "We will pay you a thousand guilders."  
"When will you set to work?" "Now," replied the Pied Piper.

Explanation: Capital letters start sentences and names (How, Pied Piper), dialogue is enclosed in quotation marks, questions use question marks, commas separate short speech from the reporting clause, and the article "a" is needed before "thousand guilders."

mr. Anik Akash a doctor has come to join the Upazila Health Complex. After joining he has started working. Suddenly a patient has come. The patient says, I’ve a pain in my stomach.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Mr. Anik Akash, a doctor, has come to join the Upazila Health Complex. After joining, he has started working. Suddenly, a patient has come. The patient says, "I've a pain in my stomach."

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা: শিরোনাম ও ব্যক্তির নাম, প্রতিষ্ঠান—যেমন "Mr.", "Anik Akash", "Upazila Health Complex"—প্রচলিতভাবে বড় হাতের অক্ষরে লেখা হয়; বাক্য শুরুেও বড় হাতের অক্ষর লাগে। "a doctor" এখানে নামের পর প্রকাশিত আপোোসিটিভ, তাই সেটার আগে ও পরে কমা লাগে, এবং "After joining,"–এর পরে ইনট্রোডাকটরি ফ্রেজ হিসেবে কমা দরকার। সরাসরি বলা কথার আগে কমা ও উদ্ধৃতি চিহ্ন ব্যবহার করতে হয়, আর কথাটা সঠিক ইংরেজিতে হওয়া উচিত: "I have a pain in my stomach" বা "I've got a pain in my stomach" ("I've a pain" সাধারণত গ্রহণযোগ্য নয়)।

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Have you heard the name of Aesop?" asked the teacher. "No, sir. Who was he?" "Read the lesson attentively and then you will be able to know about him. How interesting and instructive his fables are!" said the teacher.

Explanation:
"Have you heard the name of Aesop?" asked the teacher. "No, sir; who was he?" "Read the lesson attentively, and then you will be able to know about him. How interesting and instructive his fables are!" said the teacher.

Explanation: Capitalize the first word of each sentence and proper noun "Aesop." Use question marks for questions, quotation marks for spoken words, commas or semicolons to separate short replies, and an exclamation mark for the teacher's exclamatory remark; the reporting clause follows the quoted speech.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Oh my lord, please do not kill the child," said the woman. "Let her have him." The king said, "Now everything is clear to me." Pointing to the woman, he said to the servant, "Give her the child. She is the mother of the baby."

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct rewrite capitalizes the start of each sentence and proper nouns (e.g., "Oh", "Lord", "Now") and encloses spoken words in quotation marks. Use commas before speech tags ("..., said the woman"), periods to end sentences, and a semicolon or period to separate independent clauses in the final line ("Give her the child; she is the mother of the baby.").

Explanation:
The corrected version capitalizes the start of each sentence and all proper nouns (India, Mr. Reddy, Madras, Hyderabad, Delhi, Tom), uses quotation marks to show Mr. Reddy’s spoken question, and adds a question mark for the question and periods to end statements. These changes clearly separate sentences and speakers, mark direct speech, and make the meaning easy to follow.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The principal asked the committee members, "Have you reviewed all the applications and shortlisted the candidates for interview? Remember, the deadline is tomorrow."

Explanation:
The principal asked the committee members, "Have you reviewed all the applications and shortlisted the candidates for interview? Remember, the deadline is tomorrow."  

This is direct speech, so a comma precedes the quotation and the quoted question ends with a question mark; "Remember" begins a new imperative sentence and needs a comma after it and a period at the end.

Solution:
He said to the shoemaker, "You are a big blockhead! You have done the reverse of what I desired. I told you to make one of the shoes larger than the other, and instead of that, you have made one of them smaller than the other."

Explanation:
He said to the shoemaker, "You are a big blockhead; you have done the reverse of what I desired. I told you to make one of the shoes larger than the other, and instead of that you have made one of them smaller than the other."

This version capitalizes the sentence-initial word and the pronoun I, uses a comma to introduce direct speech and encloses the spoken words in quotation marks, and separates the speaker's two main ideas with a semicolon and a period for clarity. It also uses a comma before "and" to join clauses and prefers the single-word form "shoemaker."

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Will you come to my house tomorrow?" I asked the boy. "We can discuss the terms and conditions then," I said. "I shall be very happy to meet you at your house." "Thank you so much," he replied.

Explanation:
The passage needs capitalization at the start of each sentence and for the pronoun "I", and direct speech must be enclosed in quotation marks with appropriate punctuation (a question mark for the question, commas or periods before dialogue tags like "I asked" or "he replied", and a period at the end of statements). Using these rules makes each speaker’s words clear and shows sentence boundaries, so the rewritten passage is grammatically correct and easy to read.
