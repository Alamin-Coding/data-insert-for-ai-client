(b) Abir says, "I can help you."

(c) Arif said to me, "Do you want my help?"

(d) Mother said to me, "Do not run in the sun."

(e) They said to me, "Let us decide the matter ourselves."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) He told me that I had done my work.

(b) Abir says that he can help me.

(c) Arif asked me if I wanted his help.

(d) Mother told me not to run in the sun.

(e) They proposed to me that we should decide the matter ourselves.

Explanation:
(a) The reporting verb "said to" is changed to "told", and present perfect "have done" becomes past perfect "had done" to match the reporting verb in past.

(b) Since the reporting verb "says" is in present tense, the tense inside the quotation remains unchanged; "I" becomes "he" and "you" becomes "me".

(c) It's a question, so we use "asked" and "Do you want" changes to "if I wanted"; pronouns are adjusted accordingly.

(d) This is a negative command. "Said to" becomes "told", and the imperative is transformed using "not to run".

(e) "Let us" expresses a proposal, so we use "proposed that we should"; "ourselves" remains contextual.

(d) Imperative sentence; "said to" is changed to "advised", and "Study attentively" becomes "to study attentively".
