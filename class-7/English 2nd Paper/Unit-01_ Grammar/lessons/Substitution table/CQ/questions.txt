Solution:
a. Honesty is the best policy.b. He who is honest is respected here and hereafter.c. An honest person does not fear anybody.d. He is always straightforward.e. We should try to be honest from our early life.

Explanation:
Explanation: Form each sentence by choosing one item from the left column (subject or subject phrase), one from the middle (verb or auxiliary), and one from the right (complement), then join them in Subject + Verb + Complement order while keeping grammar correct. Ensure subject–verb agreement and include any needed auxiliary verbs (e.g., pick "Honesty" + "is" + "the best policy" to get the correct sentence "Honesty is the best policy"). Use only combinations that produce a grammatical meaning (for instance "We should" needs "be" before "always straightforward," so either add the verb or choose a different right-hand phrase).

It is the most effective mass medium.
Television programs are used for distance learning.
Watching TV, however, is not only entertaining but also educative.
It has become an addiction for many.

Explanation: These sentences are formed by combining the subject, verb and complement from the table while correcting verb forms and articles for grammatical accuracy. Key points: use [math]has\ become[/math] for a change of state, [math]is[/math] for a current state, ensure plural subjects take [math]are[/math] (Television programs), gerund subjects take singular verbs (Watching TV is), and include the article “an” before “addiction.”

For example: "Trees give us oxygen to breathe", "Trees are very useful to man", "We should not destroy trees", "We need oxygen to live", and "Trees provide shelter to birds and animals". These are correct because each combines a proper subject, verb and object/complement with correct word order and clear meaning.

Explanation:
Explanation: Form each sentence by taking one phrase from the first column (subject), one from the second (verb), and one from the third (complement), keeping the order subject + verb + complement. This ensures grammatical meaning—for example, "Health is wealth" or "A person who has ill health cannot enjoy his life"—so pick any five matching trios from the table to make five correct sentences.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a. Education is a pre-condition for development.b. An uneducated man is a burden for a nation.c. Illiteracy hampers all the development efforts.d. An educated man can play a role in removing illiteracy.e. After all, he/she can play a significant role to build up a nation.

Explanation:
Form each sentence by taking a subject from the first column, an appropriate verb from the second column, and a complement from the third column so the meaning is grammatically and semantically coherent. For example, "An uneducated man + can + play a role in removing illiteracy" gives "An uneducated man can play a role in removing illiteracy," and "Illiteracy + hampers + all the development efforts" gives "Illiteracy hampers all the development efforts." Follow this subject–verb–object pattern and check subject–verb agreement to form the other three sentences.

[math]\begin{array}{|l|l|l|} \hline \text{Cleanliness} & \text{ought} & \text{be followed in every aspect of our life.} \\ \text{We} & \text{should} & \text{put on clean clothes.} \\ \text{It} & \text{has to} & \text{to wash our hands before we take meals.} \\ \text{It} & \text{is} & \text{necessary to cut our nails regularly.} \\ \text{} & \text{is} & \text{also wash our hands properly after using toilet.} \\ \hline \end{array}[/math]

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a. Cleanliness has to be followed in every aspect of our life.b. We should put on clean clothes.c. It is necessary to cut our nails regularly.d. We ought to wash our hands before we take meals.e. We should also wash our hands properly after using toilet.

Explanation:
Cleanliness ought to be followed in every aspect of our life.
We should put on clean clothes.
We have to wash our hands before we take meals.
It is necessary to cut our nails regularly.
It is also necessary to wash our hands properly after using the toilet.

Explanation: Each sentence follows a subject + modal/verb + complement pattern from the table; where wording was awkward (row 3) I used the natural form "We have to wash..." and where ideas require an infinitive, verbs like "is necessary" take the infinitive ("to wash", "to cut") or a passive ("ought to be followed") for correct, natural English.

Solution:
a. No man can escape from death.b. Sooner or later he will die.c. After his death he will be forgotten forever.d. Only his good deeds will be remembered by people.e. So, we should do something for the welfare of mankind.

Explanation:
Combine each row's parts — first column as subject, second as verb/modal, and third as object/complement — to form complete sentences. This gives: No man can be remembered by people. Sooner or later he will be forgotten forever. After his death he should do something for the welfare of mankind. Only his good deeds can escape from death. So, we die. Row five has no verb in the middle column, so the simple verb "die" is used to complete that sentence.

Ensure subject-verb agreement and that the verb correctly links to the complement (e.g., "He plays an important role..." not "He is an important role"). Keep the meaning clear by correcting awkward phrasing or missing words while preserving the original ideas from the table.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a. Computer is used for using PowerPoint.b. Computer is also used for composing a document.c. Mobile phone is used for speaking with others.d. Modern technology isn't always safe for us.e. We have to ensure the safe use of modern technology.

Explanation:
Use singular verbs with singular nouns: "Computer" and "Mobile phone" take "is"/"isn't" (not "are"/"aren't"), and use the passive "is/are used for" when the device receives the action (e.g., "A computer is used for making PowerPoint presentations").  
Use active voice when the subject does the action ("We use a computer to compose a document"), and change "have to" to "has to" with the singular noun "Modern technology" and add "be" for correct obligation ("Modern technology has to be always safe for us").  
The final line is an imperative command — "Ensure the safe use of modern technology" — which correctly asks someone to take action; keep simple present tense for general facts and habitual uses.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা: এখানে প্রতিটি সারি থেকে একটি পূর্ণ বাক্য তৈরি করা হয় — প্রথম অংশ সাবজেক্ট, দ্বিতীয় অংশ ক্রিয়া, তৃতীয় অংশ অবজেক্ট/কমপ্লিমেন্ট হিসেবে কাজ করে। বাক্য গঠনে ক্রিয়ার ধরন লক্ষ করে সঠিক সম্পূরক ব্যবহার করতে হয় (যেমন "began" হলে সাধারণত "to" সহ বা "became" ব্যবহার করা ভালো), ফলে প্রতিটি সারি থেকে সহজেই মানসম্পন্ন পাঁচটি বাক্য পাওয়া যায়।

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a. An educated mother plays the key role in building up an educated nation.b. A child is always in touch with its mother.c. If the mother is educated, her children will be educated.d. An educated nation should be indebted to its educated mothers.e. So, all mothers should be educated.

Explanation:
Explanation: Form each sentence by picking one phrase from the first column (subject), one from the second (verb or auxiliary), and one from the third (object/complement) so you produce a complete subject–verb–complement structure. Ensure grammatical agreement and logical sense (for example, "An educated mother" + "plays" + "the key role in building up an educated nation" or "If the mother" + "should" + "be educated, her children will be educated"), and adjust punctuation or helpers (like adding "if" or "are") when needed. This way you can make five correct sentences by combining different items while keeping meaning and grammar correct.

ব্যাখ্যা: প্রতিটি বাক্য তৈরির জন্য টেবিলের প্রথম কলাম থেকে বিষয়, দ্বিতীয় কলাম থেকে ক্রিয়া ও তৃতীয় কলাম থেকে বাক্যাংশ নিলে পূর্ণ বাক্য হয়; কিন্তু বিষয় ও ক্রিয়ার মধ্যে সংখ্যা ও রূপের মিল (subject–verb agreement) রাখাটা জরুরি। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, "A sincere man is properly." এ ক্ষেত্রে "A sincere man" একবচন হওয়ায় "is" ঠিক এবং "They are a great virtue." এ ক্ষেত্রে "They" বহুবচন হওয়ায় "are" ব্যবহার সঠিক। এই নিয়ম মেনে টেবিল থেকে উপযুক্ত তিনটি অংশ যেকোনোভাবে মিলিয়ে অর্থবহ পাঁচটি বাক্য বানানো যায়।

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা: টেবিলটির প্রথম কলাম সাবজেক্ট, দ্বিতীয় কলাম ক্রিয়া এবং তৃতীয় কলাম বাক্যের বাকি অংশ প্রদর্শন করে; একটি ঠিকঠাক বাক্য গঠনের জন্য S–V–O ক্রমানুসারে একেকটি টুকরা বেছে নেয়া হয়। সাবজেক্ট ও ক্রিয়ার মধ্যে সংখ্যা ও রূপ মিলতে হবে (যেমন "These days" বহুবচন — তাই "are" হবে), এবং বাক্যের অর্থ পাওয়ার জন্য ক্রিয়া ও অব্যয়াংশের সাথে মিলিয়ে যুক্তাংশগুলো coherently সাজাতে হবে (যেমন তারিখগুলো বিবৃতির অংশ হিসেবে ব্যবহার করা হয়, "16th December"‑এর ক্ষেত্রে "must have a glorious day" বা "is observed" প্রভৃতি)। এই নিয়ম অনুসরণ করলেই টেবিল থেকে পাঁচটি স্বাভাবিক ও ব্যাকরণগতভাবে সঠিক বাক্য তৈরি করা যাবে।
