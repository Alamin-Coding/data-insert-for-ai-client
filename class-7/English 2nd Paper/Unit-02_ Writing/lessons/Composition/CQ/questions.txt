Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Discipline}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Discipline means following rules and being orderly in everything we do. It helps us live a good and meaningful life. Without discipline, life becomes chaotic and unproductive. It is needed in every part of life — in school, home, office, and even on the road.[math]\textbf{Importance in Student Life:}[/math]
 A student must have discipline to succeed. Attending school on time, doing homework regularly, listening to teachers, and respecting others are all parts of student discipline. A disciplined student can become a successful person in the future.[math]\textbf{In Family and Society:}[/math]
 Discipline in the family creates peace and understanding. If everyone behaves properly, there are fewer conflicts. In society, discipline ensures law and order. If citizens obey rules, there is peace and progress.[math]\textbf{In National Life:}[/math]
 A disciplined nation is a developed nation. Workers, officers, leaders — all must follow discipline to build a strong country. The army is an example of strict discipline.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Discipline is the key to success and peace. It makes a person responsible, honest, and respectful. We must learn and practice discipline from an early age to become good human beings.

Explanation:
A correct 250-word composition on "Discipline" is right because it clearly defines the term and explains its importance in personal, academic, and social life, giving readers a focused central idea. It helps students understand the concept by using one or two concrete examples or practices (like time management, habit formation) and by showing the benefits of discipline through outcomes such as success, reliability, and self-control. Structurally, a brief introduction, two or three body paragraphs with examples, and a concise conclusion keep the essay coherent and complete within the word limit.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Value of Time}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Value of Time}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Time is the most valuable thing in our life. It is more precious than money, gold, or anything else. Once time is gone, it never returns. So, we must value every second and use time wisely.[math]\textbf{Importance in Life:}[/math]
 Everything in the world follows time. The sun rises and sets on time. Trains and planes run according to schedule. If we do not use time properly, we fall behind in life. Time helps us become successful and respected.[math]\textbf{Time for Students:}[/math]
 Student life is the best time to build a future. Those who study regularly, follow routine, and do everything on time become good students. Laziness and delay bring failure and sadness. So, students should make good use of their time.[math]\textbf{Famous Quotes:}[/math]
 There is a saying — “Time and tide wait for none.” This teaches us that we must not waste time. Another saying is — “Work while you work, play while you play.” This tells us that everything has a proper time.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Time is like a sword — if we do not cut with it, it will cut us. Success and happiness depend on proper use of time. So, we should always be punctual, organized, and never waste time.

Explanation:
Time is a priceless resource because it is limited and irreversible. Every person, rich or poor, gets the same 24 hours, and once a moment passes it cannot be recovered; recognizing this truth makes us careful about how we spend our days. Using time wisely means setting clear priorities—focusing first on tasks that matter most for learning, work, health, and relationships—so effort produces real progress rather than mere busyness.

Good time management begins with planning: making realistic schedules, breaking big goals into small steps, and avoiding procrastination. Simple habits like waking up early, limiting distractions (for example social media), and allocating specific time blocks for study or practice turn intentions into results. Consistency is more powerful than occasional effort; steady daily work compounds into skill, knowledge, and opportunities over months and years.

Wasting time leads to missed chances, stress, and regret. When we delay important tasks, problems pile up and quality suffers. In contrast, valuing time brings discipline, reduces anxiety, and builds confidence because tasks are completed and goals are met. Time also teaches respect for others—being punctual shows consideration and strengthens trust.

Ultimately, treating time as valuable helps us live a purposeful life. It encourages us to invest in things that matter—education, health, relationships, and honest work—so that when we look back, we see a life shaped by thoughtful choices rather than by avoidable losses.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Women Empowerment in Bangladesh}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Women empowerment means giving women the right to participate equally in all areas of life — education, employment, decision-making, and leadership. In Bangladesh, women’s status is improving, but still many challenges remain.[math]\textbf{Importance:}[/math]
 Empowered women contribute to family income, children’s education, and the country’s progress. They raise their voices against injustice and help build a more equal society. No nation can develop if half of its population is left behind.[math]\textbf{Progress in Bangladesh:}[/math]
 In recent years, Bangladesh has made good progress. Girls now go to school and do well in exams. Many women work in garments, banks, education, and even police and army. Women are now ministers, doctors, engineers, and entrepreneurs.[math]\textbf{Obstacles:}[/math]
 But problems still exist. Many girls face early marriage, domestic violence, and lack of safety. In rural areas, women often have less freedom. Social customs and lack of education make it hard for them to grow.[math]\textbf{How to Empower:}[/math]
 Education is key. Educated women become confident and independent. Laws must protect women’s rights. Workplaces must ensure safety and respect. Media and community leaders must promote positive role models.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Women empowerment is not a choice — it is a necessity. If we educate and support our girls, they will change the future of Bangladesh. Empowered women mean a strong nation.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{A Rainy Day}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{A Rainy Day}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 A rainy day is a day when the sky remains cloudy and it rains continuously or off and on. In Bangladesh, rainy days are very common during the monsoon. Though some people find it uncomfortable, a rainy day is a source of beauty and emotion for many.[math]\textbf{Nature’s Look:}[/math]
 On a rainy day, the whole sky remains overcast with clouds. The rain falls gently or heavily, depending on the weather. Trees and plants look fresh and green. Roads become muddy and slippery. Rivers, ponds, and canals overflow with water. Birds take shelter in trees, and the whole environment looks quiet and calm.[math]\textbf{Effect on Life:}[/math]
 For office goers and students, a rainy day can be troublesome. People get wet, buses run late, and traffic jams become worse. Schools sometimes remain closed. But for children and villagers, a rainy day brings fun. Children play in the rain and make paper boats. Farmers become happy as rain helps in cultivation.[math]\textbf{Food and Mood:}[/math]
 Many people enjoy hot tea, khichuri, eggs, and fried food on a rainy day. The sound of rain falling on tin roofs creates a peaceful feeling. Writers and poets often get inspiration on rainy days.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 A rainy day is a part of nature’s beauty. Though it creates some problems, it also brings joy, peace, and refreshment. It teaches us to pause and enjoy the simple moments of life.

Explanation:
Rain began as a hesitant whisper, then gathered courage to drum steadily on the roof, turning the ordinary afternoon into a soft symphony. Windows blurred with streaks of silver as droplets chased each other down the glass; the garden inhaled the scent of wet earth and exhaled fresh, green promises. Children pressed faces against panes, eyes wide with the small, private thrill of suspended play, while umbrellas bloomed like colorful mushrooms along the street. Puddles became maps for small boats and toy sailors, reflections of neon signs and gray clouds mingling in miniature lakes. The city, usually sharp with hurry, slowed its breath; footsteps splashed in rhythm and conversations softened beneath the patter. Inside, a kettle hissed and steam wrote quick, warm letters on the cool air, while someone reached for an old book whose pages smelled of attic summers and forgotten winters. The rain smoothed the day’s edges, reconciling hurried plans with the gentle permission to pause. Lovers walked closer under shared canopies, their laughter muffled but brighter against the gray. Farther away, a farmer welcomed the softened soil like a relieved friend, and rooftop gardens drank greedily, leaves glistening like polished coins. Nightfall dimmed the rain to a lullaby, and the lamps reflected in wet streets seemed like lanterns guiding thoughts inward. In that steady, patient downpour, the world felt both cleansed and quietly celebrated, as if the sky were washing corners of the day to prepare them for a softer, clearer tomorrow. Everyone slept with peaceful smiles.

This composition works because it uses sensory details—sound, sight, smell—and concrete images to create a vivid rainy-day atmosphere. The structure moves from outside scenes to indoor moments and back, giving a complete, relatable picture that helps readers feel the mood and purpose of the rain.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{A Visit to a Historical Place }[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Visiting historical places is always educational and exciting. It helps us connect with our past and understand our heritage. Last month, I had the opportunity to visit Lalbagh Fort, one of the most famous historical landmarks in Dhaka, Bangladesh.[math]\textbf{Location and History:}[/math]
 Lalbagh Fort is located in the old part of Dhaka city. It was built in 1678 during the Mughal period by Prince Muhammad Azam, the son of Emperor Aurangzeb. Though it was never completed, the fort remains a symbol of Mughal architecture and history. It holds stories of love, war, and incomplete dreams.[math]\textbf{What I Saw:}[/math]
 The fort is surrounded by high walls. Inside, there are several important buildings such as the Tomb of Pari Bibi, the mosque, and the audience hall. The gardens are beautifully maintained. The Mughal designs and carvings on the walls impressed me deeply. I also visited the museum that displays weapons, utensils, coins, and clothes of that era.[math]\textbf{Feelings and Realizations:}[/math]
 Walking through the fort, I felt like I had traveled back in time. It made me think about the lives of kings, queens, and common people during the Mughal rule. I realized how rich our culture and history are.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Visiting Lalbagh Fort was a memorable experience. It taught me a lot about architecture, culture, and the need to preserve our history. Every student should visit such places to learn beyond books.

Explanation:
Explanation: The 250-word composition is correct because it follows a clear structure—an engaging introduction, body paragraphs describing the place, its history and sensory details, and a concise personal reflection and conclusion—so it both informs and evokes the experience within the required length. This approach teaches the underlying concept of writing about a historical visit: combine factual historical context with chronological narration and vivid sensory description, supported by personal impressions, to make the account accurate and memorable. Keep language simple, sentences focused, and avoid unrelated details so the composition remains coherent and stays near the 250-word target.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Anti-discrimination Student Movement}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 The Anti-discrimination Student Movement was one of the biggest student-led protests in Bangladesh in recent times. It happened in July 2024 and started because students were unhappy about the unfair job quota system announced by the government.[math]\textbf{The Cause of Protest:}[/math]
 In June 2024, the High Court of Bangladesh declared a 30% quota for children of freedom fighters in government jobs. However, there were already quotas for other groups. As a result, only 44% of jobs remained open for general applicants. Students believed this system was unjust and demanded a fair distribution of opportunities.[math]\textbf{Historical Background:}[/math]
 This protest was not new. Students had previously protested against quota systems in 2013 and 2018. Those movements created awareness, but in 2024, the issue became more serious and widespread.[math]\textbf{Nature of the Protest:}[/math]
 Students across the country took to the streets. They blocked major roads and organized sit-ins. On July 15, the protest turned violent when armed individuals attacked students. Many were injured. Yet, the protests grew stronger. Social media helped spread the movement quickly.[math]\textbf{Demand and Result:}[/math]
 On August 3, students declared that the government must resign. Their demand was bold, but it showed their frustration. They wanted fairness, not privilege based on birth. The protest was about equality, merit, and justice.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 The Anti-discrimination Student Movement was a powerful example of student unity and courage. It reminded the nation that youth will rise against injustice. The movement has made a permanent mark on Bangladesh’s political and social history.

Explanation:
This explanation is correct because it shows that a good 250-word composition on the Anti-discrimination Student Movement should define the movement, explain its causes and objectives, describe concrete student actions and outcomes, and end with a clear call to action—covering the essential parts readers expect. Focusing on these components (definition, examples, strategies, impact, conclusion) helps students organize ideas logically and write a concise, coherent, and persuasive essay.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Artificial Intelligence}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 21st century. It refers to the ability of machines to mimic human intelligence and behavior. AI enables machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs, and perform tasks that normally require human thinking. From smart assistants on our phones to robots performing surgery, AI is rapidly transforming our world.[math]\textbf{Applications:}[/math]
 AI is used in a wide range of fields. In healthcare, it helps in early diagnosis, robotic surgery, and patient monitoring. In education, AI can personalize learning for students. In business, AI helps in data analysis, customer support, and fraud detection. Self-driving cars, language translation tools, and facial recognition systems are some daily uses of AI. Even in agriculture, AI is used to predict weather, manage irrigation, and monitor crops using drones.[math]\textbf{Advantages:}[/math]
 AI offers many benefits. It increases efficiency, reduces human effort, and performs repetitive tasks faster. AI systems can operate 24/7 and handle large volumes of data quickly. It helps industries grow faster and makes our lives more convenient. In dangerous jobs like mining, firefighting, or space exploration, AI-based robots are lifesavers.[math]\textbf{Challenges and Concerns:}[/math]
 Despite its advantages, AI has some drawbacks. It may cause unemployment as machines replace human workers. There are ethical concerns like data privacy, bias in algorithms, and misuse in warfare or surveillance. If misused, AI can be harmful. Over-dependence on machines may reduce human thinking abilities.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Artificial Intelligence is not just a trend — it is the future. It has the potential to solve global problems and improve life in countless ways. But we must ensure its responsible and ethical use. Governments, tech companies, and citizens must work together to build an AI-powered world that benefits all of humanity.

Explanation:
A good 250-word composition on Artificial Intelligence is correct when it begins with a clear definition of AI and then explains its main applications and impacts, because that shows the writer understands both the concept and its relevance. Including a brief history, concrete examples (such as healthcare, transportation, and education), and a balanced note on benefits and ethical concerns demonstrates breadth without unnecessary detail. This structure helps students present core ideas concisely and reflects the underlying concept that AI comprises technologies enabling machines to perform tasks that normally require human-like intelligence.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Child Labour in Bangladesh}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Child Labour in Bangladesh}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Child labour is a serious social and economic problem in Bangladesh. It means engaging children in jobs that are harmful to their physical and mental growth. Millions of children in our country work in factories, hotels, shops, and households to support their families.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 The main causes of child labour are poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, and lack of awareness. Many parents are so poor that they send their children to work instead of sending them to school. Employers prefer children because they can be paid less and forced to work long hours.[math]\textbf{Types of Work:}[/math]
 Child labourers in Bangladesh work in garment factories, brickfields, tea stalls, and as domestic workers. Some even work in dangerous places like chemical industries and construction sites. They often face abuse, low wages, and health problems.[math]\textbf{Effects:}[/math]
 Child labour deprives children of education and a proper childhood. It keeps them in a cycle of poverty. They grow up with poor health, lack of skills, and low self-esteem. This creates an unskilled and weak future generation for the country.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 The government must enforce child labour laws strictly. Free and compulsory education must be ensured. Parents must be given support and jobs so that they don’t need to send their children to work. NGOs and media should create awareness.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Child labour is a national shame. Every child deserves education, care, and protection. We all must work together to eliminate child labour and build a better future for our children.

Explanation:
Explanation: The composition correctly defines child labour in Bangladesh, identifies key causes (poverty, limited schooling, family pressure), explains harmful effects on health, education and rights, and outlines government and NGO responses plus practical solutions. It is organized logically and uses clear, simple language with relevant examples, which makes the topic understandable within a 250-word limit. This helps students grasp both the reasons behind child labour and the realistic steps needed to prevent it, enabling them to write a balanced, informed essay.

Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Corruption in Society}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Corruption in Society}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Corruption is a serious disease in society. It means dishonest or illegal behavior, especially by powerful people like government officials, politicians, or businessmen. Corruption destroys the development of a nation, creates injustice, and spreads inequality.[math]\textbf{Forms of Corruption:}[/math]
 Bribery, nepotism, tax evasion, misuse of public funds, and cheating are common types of corruption. In many cases, people have to pay extra money to get jobs, licenses, or services that should be free or fair. It also happens in courts, police, hospitals, and schools.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 The main causes of corruption are greed, lack of transparency, weak law enforcement, political influence, and poverty. When people see that corrupt people are not punished, they lose faith in justice and become corrupt themselves.[math]\textbf{Effects on Society:}[/math]
 Corruption makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. It stops good people from getting opportunities. Roads, schools, and hospitals remain poor in quality because of fund theft. It leads to frustration, crime, and public anger. The whole society suffers.[math]\textbf{Ways to Stop Corruption:}[/math]
 Strong laws and punishments are needed. Digital systems and automation can reduce human contact and corruption. People must be educated to be honest. Media and civil society should raise their voice. Whistleblowers must be protected.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Corruption is a curse that destroys both individuals and nations. If we want a just and developed country, we must fight against corruption together. Honesty should be taught at home and school.

Explanation:
A good 250-word composition on "Corruption in Society" is correct when it opens with a concise definition and thesis, then discusses main causes, illustrates clear social and economic effects, and ends with practical solutions—this structure ensures the topic is covered coherently within the word limit. Emphasizing specific examples and linking causes to consequences helps readers grasp the underlying mechanisms of corruption, while offering realistic remedies (transparency, accountability, education) shows how change can occur. Clear, simple language and focused paragraphs make the argument persuasive and easy to follow.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Deforestation and Its Effects}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Deforestation means cutting down trees and destroying forests. It is one of the biggest threats to nature and human survival. In Bangladesh, forests are disappearing rapidly due to overpopulation, urbanization, and industrial needs.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 People cut trees for fuel, farming, furniture, and construction. Forests are cleared for roads, buildings, and factories. Illegal logging and forest fires also cause destruction. Many don’t realize the long-term effects.[math]\textbf{Effects:}[/math]
 Deforestation leads to soil erosion, loss of wildlife, and climate change. It reduces rainfall and increases temperature. Rivers dry up, and natural disasters like floods and droughts become common. Animals lose their homes, and biodiversity is damaged. It also affects air quality and health.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 We must plant trees regularly. Deforested lands should be reforested. Alternative fuels should be used to reduce tree cutting. Forest laws must be enforced strictly. People should be educated on the value of trees.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Trees are our natural friends. If forests die, life on Earth will become impossible. We must protect forests for ourselves and future generations. Deforestation must stop now.

Explanation:
A good 250-word composition on deforestation and its effects is correct when it clearly states what deforestation is, outlines its main causes, describes the key environmental and social impacts, and suggests practical solutions. Defining deforestation briefly and linking it to outcomes like biodiversity loss, increased carbon emissions and soil erosion helps students understand the chain of cause and effect. Structure the piece with a short introduction, focused paragraphs on causes, effects and remedies, and a concise conclusion, using one or two concrete facts or examples to support each point so the essay is informative yet stays within the word limit.

Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Early Marriage: Causes and Prevention}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Early Marriage: Causes and Prevention}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Early marriage means getting married before reaching legal age. In Bangladesh, the legal age is 18 for girls and 21 for boys. But many children, especially girls, are forced into marriage at 14 or even younger. Early marriage is a violation of human rights and causes long-term damage to society.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 Poverty is a major cause. Poor families think marrying off daughters reduces financial burden. Lack of education is another reason. In many villages, people believe girls should marry early to maintain family honor. Fear of harassment or insecurity also leads to early marriage. Some parents are unaware of the legal and health risks.[math]\textbf{Negative Effects:}[/math]
 Early marriage ends a child’s education and future dreams. Child brides face health risks like early pregnancy and childbirth complications. Many suffer from malnutrition, depression, and domestic abuse. Their children also suffer from poor care and education. The cycle of poverty continues.[math]\textbf{How to Prevent:}[/math]
 Education is the best way to stop early marriage. If girls stay in school, they marry later and live better lives. Parents need awareness programs. Religious leaders and local authorities should speak against child marriage. The law must be enforced strictly, and violators must be punished.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Early marriage is harmful for individuals and the nation. It kills dreams, health, and opportunities. We must fight early marriage with education, awareness, and strict law. Let every child grow freely and safely.

Explanation:
কিশোর বয়সে বিয়ে বা আদ্রা বাগধারা—Early Marriage—একটি গুরুতর সামাজিক সমস্যা যা ব্যক্তিগত স্বাস্থ্যের পাশাপাশি সামাজিক ও অর্থনৈতিক উন্নয়নকে বাধাগ্রস্ত করে। এর প্রধান কারণগুলোর মধ্যে দারিদ্র্য, শিক্ষা না থাকা, সামাজিক রীতি ও কুসংস্কার, লিঙ্গভিত্তিক বৈষম্য এবং নিরাপত্তাহীনতা আছে। দরিদ্র পরিবারগুলো প্রায়ই ছেলে-কন্যার বিবাহ করে বোঝা হ্রাস করতে চায়, আর শিক্ষার অভাবে কিশোরীরা স্বনির্ভর হবার দক্ষতা ও জ্ঞানের সুযোগ হারিয়ে ফেলে। পাশাপাশি পরিবার ও সমাজের চাপ—ইতিবাচকতা না বুঝে উপচে পড়া রীতিনীতি—ও দ্রুত বিবাহের দিকে ঠেলে দেয়। 

এর ক্ষতিকর প্রভাবও ব্যাপক: কিশোরীদের গর্ভাবস্থা ও প্রসবে ঝুঁকি বেড়ে যায়, মানসিক স্বাস্থ্য ঝুঁকিতে পড়ে, স্কুল ছেড়ে দেওয়ার ফলে কর্মসংস্থান-সুযোগ হারায় এবং জাতীয় উন্নয়নে নেতিবাচক প্রভাব পড়ে। 

প্রতিরোধের জন্য শিক্ষার বিস্তার সবচেয়ে কার্যকরী হাতিয়ার; মেয়েদের মানসম্মত, বাধ্যতামূলক ও দীর্ঘমেয়াদী শিক্ষা তাদের আত্মনির্ভর করে তুলতে সাহায্য করে। আইন-কানুন কঠোরভাবে প্রয়োগ, বয়স নির্ধারণ সংক্রান্ত সচেতনতা বৃদ্ধি, অভিভাবক ও সম্প্রদায়কে involving করে পরিবর্তন আনা জরুরি। অর্থনৈতিক সহায়তা ও অনুপ্রেরণা, যেমন বৃত্তি ও সামাজিক নিরাপত্তা, দারিদ্র্যজনিত আগ্রহ কমাবে। ধর্মীয় ও সমাজিক নেতাদের সঙ্গে কাজ করে কুসংস্কারের বিরুদ্ধে সচেতনতা ছড়িয়ে দিতে হবে। শেষ পর্যন্ত, কিশোর-বিবাহ রোধে যৌথ উদ্যোগ—পরিবার, শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠান, সরকার ও সেবা সংস্থার সমন্বিত প্রচেষ্টা দরকার, যাতে প্রতিটি কিশোরী পূর্ণমানুষ হিসেবে বড় হয়ে নিজের অধিকার ও সম্ভাবনা বিকশিত করতে পারে।

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Floods in Bangladesh}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Bangladesh is one of the most flood-prone countries in the world. Its geographical position, numerous rivers, and monsoon climate make it vulnerable to frequent floods. Although floods are natural, their impact on people and the economy can be devastating.[math]\textbf{Causes of Flood:}[/math]
 Heavy rainfall during the monsoon is the main cause of floods. Overflowing of rivers like Padma, Jamuna, and Brahmaputra submerges vast areas. Melting of Himalayan glaciers increases river water levels. Poor drainage in urban areas and deforestation make floods worse.[math]\textbf{Effects of Floods:}[/math]
 Floods damage crops, houses, roads, schools, and hospitals. Many people become homeless and have to take shelter in flood centers. Food and drinking water become scarce. Diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and skin infections spread easily. Educational activities are interrupted for weeks.[math]\textbf{Impact on Economy and Society:}[/math]
 Farmers suffer the most because their crops are washed away. Transportation stops, and business activities decline. Relief work becomes expensive and often delays. The country’s GDP is affected by repeated flood losses.[math]\textbf{Relief and Response:}[/math]
 The government and NGOs try to provide relief by supplying food, clean water, medicine, and shelter. Volunteers and local people also help flood victims. Boats and helicopters are used for rescue. Early warning systems are improving, but much more needs to be done.[math]\textbf{Prevention and }[/math]
 Building embankments, dredging rivers, planting trees, and improving drainage can reduce flood damage. Public awareness and community training are essential. Scientific forecasting systems must be upgraded.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 We cannot stop floods, but we can reduce their damage. Proper planning, strong infrastructure, and public cooperation can make Bangladesh more flood-resilient.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Food Adulteration}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Food adulteration is a crime against health and humanity. It means mixing harmful chemicals or low-quality substances with food to increase quantity or shelf life. This has become a serious issue in Bangladesh, especially in cities and markets.[math]\textbf{Common Types:}[/math]
 Many foods are adulterated. Formalin is used in fish and fruits, calcium carbide in mangoes, textile dye in turmeric powder, and soap in sweets. Milk is mixed with water or detergent. These chemicals are highly toxic and dangerous for health.[math]\textbf{Reasons:}[/math]
 Dishonest traders do this to earn more money. Lack of proper monitoring and weak punishment also encourage this practice. People often cannot identify adulterated food, and there is no proper labeling system.[math]\textbf{Health Hazards:}[/math]
 Adulterated food causes cancer, kidney failure, diarrhea, ulcers, and even death. Children suffer from poor growth, and pregnant women face complications. Long-term consumption damages the body silently.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 The government must take strict action. Mobile courts, fines, and jail sentences must be applied regularly. People should be aware and check labels and sources. Scientific labs should test food samples. Media and schools should teach about food safety.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Food is life. Adulterating it is like poisoning society. We must say “no” to food adulteration and build a healthy nation with honesty and responsibility.

Explanation:
This composition is correct because it begins with a clear definition of food adulteration, gives concrete examples, explains health and economic consequences, and ends with practical prevention measures and legal remedies. Food adulteration means adding or substituting harmful, inferior, or prohibited substances to increase profit or appearance, which causes illnesses and undermines public trust; understanding its causes (greed, weak regulation) and effects (disease, nutritional loss) helps students grasp why control and awareness matter. To fit 250 words, focus on a precise definition, two or three specific examples, one paragraph on impacts, and a brief, strong conclusion on prevention (consumer vigilance, testing, and enforcement).

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Gender Equality in Education}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Gender Equality in Education}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Gender equality in education means giving boys and girls equal rights and opportunities to study, grow, and succeed. In many parts of the world, especially in developing countries like Bangladesh, girls have historically faced more challenges in accessing education. But without gender equality, true development is not possible.[math]\textbf{Why It Matters:}[/math]
 When girls are educated, they become healthier, economically stronger, and more confident. They can support their families, raise better-educated children, and take leadership roles in society. Boys and girls must be treated equally in schools, colleges, and society. Education is a right, not a privilege based on gender.[math]\textbf{Current Situation in Bangladesh:}[/math]
 In recent years, Bangladesh has made progress. Girls now outnumber boys in many schools. Government programs like stipends and free books have helped improve girls’ attendance. Female teachers are encouraged, and awareness is rising. However, in rural areas, early marriage, poverty, and family restrictions still prevent many girls from continuing their education.[math]\textbf{Challenges:}[/math]
 Girls often face harassment on the way to school, lack of toilets, and unsafe environments. Some families still believe that girls do not need higher education. These social attitudes must change.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 More schools should be built closer to homes. Safety must be ensured. Parents need awareness. Laws against early marriage and gender discrimination should be strictly enforced. Both boys and girls should learn to respect each other.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Gender equality in education is essential for a fair, successful, and developed society. Let us ensure every child, regardless of gender, gets equal chance to learn and lead.

Explanation:
Gender equality in education means that girls and boys have the same opportunities to learn, participate, and succeed at every level of schooling. Ensuring equality requires removing social, economic, and cultural barriers that disproportionately affect girls, such as child marriage, poverty, and discriminatory attitudes. When both sexes receive quality education, societies gain economically through higher productivity, improved health outcomes, and greater civic participation. Educated girls are more likely to delay marriage, have healthier children, and contribute to household income, creating a virtuous cycle that benefits communities.

Schools must be safe, inclusive, and responsive: curricula should avoid gender stereotypes, teachers should receive training on gender-sensitive pedagogy, and facilities must meet the needs of all learners, including separate sanitation for girls. Policies like scholarship programs, conditional cash transfers, and community awareness campaigns can increase enrollment and retention. Data collection disaggregated by gender helps target interventions and monitor progress.

Addressing gender equality also means supporting boys where they face disadvantages and recognizing intersecting inequalities related to disability, ethnicity, and poverty. Collaboration among governments, local communities, families, and international partners is essential to create sustained change. Achieving gender equality in education is not only a matter of fairness but a strategic investment in a country's development and resilience. By committing to inclusive policies, removing barriers, and fostering supportive learning environments, education can become a powerful force for equality and empowerment for all children. Sustained political will, adequate funding, and community engagement are crucial to turn commitments into measurable educational gains for every child now.

Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Global Warming and Climate Change}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Global Warming and Climate Change}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Global warming and climate change are two of the most serious environmental issues in today’s world. Global warming refers to the rise in Earth’s average temperature due to the increase of greenhouse gases. Climate change includes global warming and its broader effects like droughts, floods, and sea-level rise.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 Burning fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil), deforestation, and industrial emissions are the major causes of global warming. These activities release carbon dioxide, methane, and other harmful gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Cutting down trees reduces the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide.[math]\textbf{Effects:}[/math]
 The Earth is getting hotter every year. Polar ice is melting, causing sea levels to rise. This leads to flooding in coastal areas. There are more droughts, heatwaves, and storms. Agriculture is being affected, and many species are becoming extinct. Bangladesh, being a low-lying country, is at high risk.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 We must reduce carbon emissions by using renewable energy like solar and wind power. Planting more trees, reducing plastic use, and recycling can help. Governments must take global steps, like following the Paris Agreement. People must also be aware and make eco-friendly choices.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Global warming is a threat to life on Earth. We must act now before it is too late. Protecting the environment is not only the duty of the government but also of every citizen.

Explanation:
The composition is correct because it clearly defines global warming and climate change, links them to increased greenhouse gases from human activities, and describes key impacts and practical solutions in a balanced way. It explains the underlying concept—that the enhanced greenhouse effect (notably from [math]CO_2[/math], methane and other gases) traps more heat, altering weather patterns, sea levels and ecosystems—so students see cause and effect. Its concise 250-word format forces focused coverage of causes, consequences and mitigation, helping learners grasp the essentials without unnecessary detail.

 During the July Revolution of 2024 in Bangladesh, graffiti became a key symbol of protest. Students and activists used graffiti to raise voices against injustice. One famous mural was painted with the question, “Who will bring justice for the murder of martyr Abu Sayeed?” Even though it was removed the next day, the message left a deep impact on society.[math]\textbf{After the Fall of the Government:}[/math]
 On August 5, 2024, after the fall of the dictatorial regime, graffiti spread across cities and towns. Walls in Dhaka were filled with slogans like “Lakho shaheeder rokte kena, deshta karo baper na!” — a protest against selling the sacrifices of martyrs. Symbols like clenched fists and rising suns were drawn to inspire strength and revolution.[math]\textbf{Unity and Artistic Protest:}[/math]
 Graffiti united students, artists, rickshaw pullers, and common people. It gave them a voice. Donations were raised through graffiti campaigns. It became more than art — it became a tool of unity, awareness, and hope.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Graffiti played a vital role during the July Revolution. It empowered the people, carried their pain and anger, and turned walls into voices. It will be remembered as a unique form of protest that changed minds and gave people courage.

Explanation:
The composition is correct because it connects graffiti’s visual elements and slogans to their political meanings, places those images within the events of the July Revolution, and shows how walls and public spaces became urgent forums for dissent and collective memory. To understand the concept, recognize graffiti as a fast, accessible visual language that spreads messages, mobilizes people, and reclaims public space—when writing, use concrete images, specific examples, and a clear structure to show how art and protest interact.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Load Shedding}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Load Shedding}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Load shedding means the temporary stopping of electricity in different areas. It is a common problem in Bangladesh, especially during the summer. It creates serious problems in homes, schools, offices, and hospitals.[math]\textbf{Causes:}[/math]
 The main cause is the shortage of electricity production. Other causes include misuse of electricity, old equipment, and poor management. When demand is more than supply, the authority cuts off power to manage the load.[math]\textbf{Effects:}[/math]
 Students cannot study properly. Business and industries face losses. Hospitals suffer during emergency treatments. Food gets spoiled. People sweat in the heat without fans or ACs. Internet and mobile networks also stop working.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 We should use electricity wisely. Government should invest in solar and wind power. Corruption and theft in the power sector must stop. Awareness programs can help people save power.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Load shedding is harmful for national progress. Everyone should help save electricity. Only then can we enjoy an uninterrupted life.

Explanation:
Load shedding refers to the planned, temporary interruption of electrical power supply to certain areas to prevent a total collapse of the power grid when demand exceeds available generation. It is typically used as an emergency measure when generation capacity, fuel supply, transmission constraints, or maintenance shortfalls make it impossible to meet peak demand. The immediate effects are widespread: households lose lighting and refrigeration, businesses halt production, schools and hospitals face disruptions, and public safety can be compromised. Repeated outages erode productivity, increase costs for businesses (through lost work and damaged equipment), and reduce the quality of life for residents.

Root causes include inadequate generation capacity, aging infrastructure, fuel shortages, poor maintenance, financial problems in power utilities, and weak grid management. Short-term coping strategies include scheduled outage notices, rotating supply to distribute inconvenience, backup generators, and community cooling/storage centers. Long-term solutions focus on increasing and diversifying supply (building new plants, investing in renewables like solar and wind), improving grid infrastructure and maintenance, strengthening transmission lines, implementing demand-side management (energy efficiency, time-of-use tariffs, smart meters), and reforming utility finances and governance to ensure reliable fuel procurement and investment.

Effective policies combine technical upgrades with realistic planning and public communication so outages are minimized and better managed. Encouraging rooftop solar, battery storage, and microgrids can reduce peak pressure on the central grid and provide resilience for critical services. Ultimately, ending chronic load shedding requires sustained investment, transparent management, and coordinated energy policy that balances supply expansion with smarter demand management.

Use simple language, linking words for coherence, and check the word count to ensure completeness without unnecessary repetition.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Population Problem in Bangladesh}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. With over 170 million people living in a small area, the country is facing serious population-related challenges. This problem affects almost every aspect of life — from food and housing to education and employment.[math]\textbf{Reasons for Overpopulation:}[/math]
 Lack of awareness about family planning, early marriage, poverty, and low literacy rates are the main reasons for overpopulation. In rural areas, people often think more children mean more help in work. Many families are unaware of the economic and social burden caused by large families.[math]\textbf{Effects of Overpopulation:}[/math]
 Overpopulation creates a huge strain on food, water, land, education, and healthcare. Schools become overcrowded, and hospitals cannot treat all patients properly. Unemployment rises, and crime rates increase. Urban areas suffer from traffic jams, pollution, and housing crises.[math]\textbf{Impact on Development:}[/math]
 Rapid population growth makes it difficult to provide quality education and job opportunities. It slows down economic progress. Resources that could be used for development are instead spent on basic needs like food and shelter. Government services become insufficient.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 The only way to solve this problem is through strong family planning programs, public awareness campaigns, and compulsory education for girls. Delaying marriage and promoting one or two-child families can help control growth. Religious leaders, teachers, and media can also spread awareness.[math]\textbf{Government Role:}[/math]
 The government should ensure availability of free birth control services, provide incentives for small families, and punish false registration or misuse of welfare schemes.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Population is both a strength and a challenge. If managed well, it can become a national asset. But if it continues to grow unchecked, it can destroy progress. We must act now to save our future.

 Price hike increases inequality. The rich get richer, but the poor get poorer. The middle class is disappearing. Social unrest, frustration, and protests become more common. It also damages trust in markets and government policies.[math]\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]
 The government must monitor markets regularly. Hoarders and corrupt traders should be punished. Subsidies should be given on food, medicine, and fuel. Encouraging local production and reducing dependency on imports will help stabilize prices.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Price hike is a threat to peace and development. It must be controlled with strong action, honest leadership, and public cooperation. Only then can people live with hope and dignity.

Explanation:
Explanation: The 250‑word composition is correct because it succinctly outlines the main causes of price hikes in Bangladesh (supply disruptions, inflation, currency depreciation), describes their social and economic effects (reduced purchasing power, food insecurity, strain on households), and proposes clear remedies (targeted subsidies, improved supply chains, prudent fiscal and monetary policies) in a logical order. This reflects the underlying concept of effective composition: address the topic directly, use relevant facts and local examples, and connect causes to consequences and solutions within the word limit. For students: plan a brief introduction, two focused paragraphs covering causes and effects with examples, and a concise conclusion offering solutions, using simple language and coherent linkage.

Write a composition on [math]\textbf{Renewable Energy for a Sustainable Future}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Renewable Energy for a Sustainable Future}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Renewable energy means energy from natural sources like the sun, wind, water, and biomass that do not run out. It is clean, safe, and environmentally friendly. In the face of climate change and energy crisis, renewable energy is the only path to a sustainable and secure future.[math]\textbf{Types of Renewable Energy:}[/math]
 The main types are solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and biomass energy. These sources are naturally replenished and do not pollute the environment. Solar panels collect sunlight, wind turbines use wind, and dams produce electricity from flowing water.[math]\textbf{Importance:}[/math]
 Fossil fuels like coal and oil are limited and harmful to the environment. They cause pollution, global warming, and health issues. Renewable energy reduces carbon emissions, slows down climate change, and keeps the air clean. It also creates green jobs and makes countries energy-independent.[math]\textbf{Renewable Energy in Bangladesh:}[/math]
 Bangladesh has good potential for solar and wind energy. Many schools and homes in rural areas now use solar panels. The government is promoting “Green Energy” through different projects. Off-grid solar systems have brought electricity to remote villages.[math]\textbf{Challenges:}[/math]
 High initial costs, lack of technology, and lack of skilled manpower are the main barriers. People also lack awareness of the long-term benefits. More investment, training, and research are needed.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Renewable energy is not just a choice — it is a necessity. For a clean, healthy, and sustainable world, we must shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Every step toward green energy is a step toward saving the planet.

Explanation:
Explanation: Focusing a composition on renewable energy is correct because renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro, biomass) produce little or no greenhouse gases, so they directly address climate change and air pollution while ensuring long-term energy supply. The underlying concept is that renewables are naturally replenished and reduce dependence on finite fossil fuels, bringing environmental, economic, and social benefits when supported by technology, investment, and policy. Emphasizing scalability, community adoption, and sustainable infrastructure in the composition shows how renewable energy leads to a resilient, low-carbon future.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{The Impact of COVID-19 on Education}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Impact of COVID-19 on Education}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 The COVID-19 pandemic affected every part of life across the world. One of the sectors hit hardest was education. Schools, colleges, and universities were closed for months. Students, teachers, and parents faced an entirely new way of learning. In Bangladesh, the impact was even more serious because of limited digital access.[math]\textbf{Closure of Institutions:}[/math]
 Educational institutions were closed for over a year. Board exams were delayed or canceled. Millions of students lost connection with formal learning. Children in rural areas suffered the most due to lack of smartphones, internet, or even electricity.[math]\textbf{Online Education:}[/math]
 During the pandemic, online classes became the new normal. Platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and YouTube were used. However, not all students could attend regularly. Network issues, lack of devices, and poor digital literacy were common problems. Many students lost interest and motivation.[math]\textbf{Mental Health and Social Impact:}[/math]
 Isolation from classmates, stress of online learning, and uncertainty about exams caused mental pressure. Many students fell into depression, anxiety, or laziness. Physical activities stopped, and social development was hampered.[math]\textbf{Positive Outcomes:}[/math]
 Despite challenges, the crisis increased awareness of digital learning. Teachers and students learned new technologies. Educational apps and TV programs (like Sangsad TV in Bangladesh) reached some remote learners. It also showed the importance of internet and IT in education.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 COVID-19 showed us that education must be flexible and accessible to all. Digital tools must be developed, and students must be supported emotionally and technologically. Education must go on, no matter the situation.

Explanation:
COVID-19 transformed education worldwide, exposing both strengths and deep weaknesses in systems and accelerating long-term change. Prolonged school closures forced a rapid shift to remote learning, which highlighted the digital divide as many learners lacked devices, reliable internet, or a conducive home environment. Educators adapted by creating online lessons, using video conferencing, and adopting flexible assessment, yet disadvantaged students often experienced greater learning loss and reduced access to support services. The crisis also drove innovation: blended learning models, open educational resources, and low-tech approaches such as radio and SMS lessons were scaled to reach those without broadband. Higher education faced financial and enrollment pressures but expanded virtual instruction and reconsidered program delivery and student services. Social and emotional learning gained prominence as students and teachers coped with isolation, stress, and disrupted routines, prompting schools to strengthen mental health supports and community partnerships. Assessment practices shifted toward formative, competency-based methods that emphasize critical thinking over memorization. Policy responses varied; some governments invested in connectivity and devices, while others prioritized phased reopenings with health protocols. Long-term outcomes depend on recovery efforts: targeted tutoring, extended learning time, and data-driven monitoring can mitigate learning losses, but without equitable investments the pandemic risks widening existing inequalities. To build resilient education systems, stakeholders must invest in infrastructure, continuous teacher development, inclusive policies, and supports for vulnerable learners, while sharing best practices internationally to prepare for future crises.

Explanation:
This composition is correct because it summarizes key impacts (access, pedagogy, equity, mental health, policy) and links immediate disruptions to long-term implications and remedies. It helps students understand the concept by showing cause (pandemic closures) and effect (remote learning, widened gaps), plus concrete responses needed to recover and strengthen education systems.

Effective English skills—speaking, listening, reading, and writing—also help individuals present ideas clearly, participate in conferences, and build professional networks. Beyond practical advantages, learning English fosters personal growth by exposing learners to different cultures, media, and perspectives, encouraging critical thinking and empathy.

Developing strong English skills requires consistent practice, exposure to authentic materials, and confidence in communication. Integrating language learning into daily life through reading books, watching films, engaging in conversations, and using online resources accelerates progress. Teachers and learners should focus on meaningful communication rather than rote memorization, emphasizing fluency and comprehension.

In summary, learning English is a valuable investment that broadens horizons academically, professionally, and personally. It connects people worldwide, creates opportunities, and empowers learners to participate fully in a global society. Regular study cultivates confidence, adaptability, and creativity; these lifelong benefits enrich cultural understanding and enable individuals to contribute meaningfully to their communities and to global conversations. They also boost employability too.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{Tree Plantation}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Trees are an important part of our environment. They give us life and support the balance of nature. Without trees, we cannot survive. So tree plantation is not only necessary, it is a duty for all of us.[math]\textbf{Benefits of Trees:}[/math]
 Trees provide oxygen, shade, and fruits. They absorb carbon dioxide and reduce air pollution. They stop soil erosion, bring rain, and keep the weather pleasant. Trees are home to many birds and animals.[math]\textbf{Economic and Health Benefits:}[/math]
 Trees give us wood, medicine, and raw materials. They reduce stress, make our surroundings peaceful, and help us live longer. Parks and gardens with trees make cities more livable.[math]\textbf{Condition in Bangladesh:}[/math]
 Our country needs more trees. According to experts, 25% of land should be forested, but we have much less. Deforestation is harming our environment.[math]\textbf{Best Time and Awareness:}[/math]
 The rainy season is the best time for planting trees. Schools, colleges, and government offices should organize tree plantation programs. People should be aware of its importance and join such efforts.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Tree plantation is a great act of service to nature and future generations. If every person plants and cares for at least one tree, we can make our world greener and better.

Explanation:
Tree plantation is a simple yet powerful activity that helps protect the environment and improves human life. Planting trees increases green cover, conserves soil, conserves water, and supports biodiversity. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, reducing air pollution and mitigating climate change. Their roots prevent soil erosion, maintain groundwater levels, and provide shade that cools surrounding areas.

Besides environmental benefits, trees support wildlife by offering habitat and food for birds, insects, and small animals. Fruit-bearing trees supply nutritious food and can boost local economies. Urban trees enhance the beauty of neighborhoods, increase property values, and improve mental well-being by creating peaceful green spaces. Community tree-planting projects foster social cohesion and teach children about nature and responsibility.

Successful tree plantation requires choosing the right species for local climate and soil, proper planting techniques, and ongoing care. Dig a hole twice the width of the root ball, place the sapling upright, backfill with soil, and water thoroughly. Mulching conserves moisture and suppresses weeds, while staking protects young trees from wind. Regular watering during the first two years and protection from pests are essential for survival.

Governments, schools, NGOs, and individuals must collaborate to increase tree cover. Incentives like community nurseries, awareness campaigns, and legal protection for forests encourage participation. By planting and nurturing trees, we invest in a healthier, greener future for ourselves and coming generations. Each planted tree is a step toward cleaner air, stable climates, and richer biodiversity. Small efforts by many people create lasting change around the world.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Season I Like Best (Spring)}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Among the six seasons in Bangladesh, I like spring the most. It is called the queen of all seasons. It comes with beauty, charm, and freshness. The months of Falgun and Chaitra make up this season. Nature seems to wear a new dress in spring, and everything looks colorful and pleasant.[math]\textbf{Comparison with Other Seasons:}[/math]
 Compared to summer, which is very hot and sometimes unbearable, spring is very enjoyable. Unlike the rainy season that often brings floods and suffering, spring brings joy and happiness. Winter is too cold for many people, but spring has a balanced temperature. Neither too hot nor too cold — it is just perfect. That is why spring stands out among all the seasons.[math]\textbf{Beauty of Spring:}[/math]
 Spring is the season of flowers and greenery. Trees get new leaves, and flowers bloom everywhere. Birds sing sweet songs. Bees fly from flower to flower. The air feels fresh, and the sky is mostly clear. Festivals like Pohela Falgun and Valentine’s Day are also celebrated during this time, adding to its charm.[math]\textbf{My Feelings:}[/math]
 Spring always fills my heart with peace. When I see nature blooming, I feel energetic and inspired. My mind becomes fresh, and I feel closer to nature.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Although every season has its own value, spring is my most favorite. Its beauty, mild weather, and cheerful environment make it special. I wait for this season every year because it brings color, joy, and new life to everything around us.

Explanation:
Choose one season and state it clearly in the opening line, then support that choice with specific reasons—weather, activities, scenery, and personal memories—so the reader understands why you prefer it. Organize the piece into an introduction, two or three body paragraphs with concrete examples and sensory details, and a short conclusion; this structure helps you reach about 250 words while staying focused. Use varied sentence lengths, transition words, and vivid details to make your argument convincing and easy to follow.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Role of Youth in National Development}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Youth are the strength and future of a nation. They are energetic, creative, and full of new ideas. If guided properly, they can lead a country towards prosperity and progress. In Bangladesh, a large portion of the population is young. Therefore, the role of youth in national development is very crucial.[math]\textbf{Contribution in Education and Innovation:}[/math]
 Educated and skilled youth bring innovation to technology, science, and business. They research, invent, and improve processes. Young people can solve national problems like unemployment, corruption, and poverty through new ideas and entrepreneurship.[math]\textbf{Social and Political Engagement:}[/math]
 Youth must be aware of social issues like gender inequality, drug abuse, and climate change. They can join social campaigns, awareness programs, and community development projects. In politics, honest and educated youth can promote transparency and ethical leadership.[math]\textbf{Economic Development:}[/math]
 Young entrepreneurs start small businesses and create jobs. Skilled workers in ICT, freelancing, and startups are earning foreign currency. Agriculture and rural development also benefit from youth involvement with modern tools and methods.[math]\textbf{Obstacles and Solutions:}[/math]
 Many youths suffer from lack of education, unemployment, and addiction. The government must ensure proper training, loans for business, and career counseling. Moral and ethical education is essential to keep youth on the right path.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 The future of Bangladesh depends on how we engage and empower our youth. If we educate and support them, they will build a strong, honest, and prosperous nation.

Explanation:
The composition is correct because it highlights the key roles of youth—education and skill development, creativity and entrepreneurship, civic participation, and leadership—showing how these translate into human capital, innovation, and social progress. It helps students understand the underlying concept that national development depends not only on resources but on motivated, skilled people who can implement ideas and drive change. The piece stays focused and balanced by linking specific youth actions (learning, volunteering, starting enterprises, and engaging in governance) to measurable outcomes like economic growth, social cohesion, and sustainable progress.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Role of Technology in Education}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Technology has changed the face of education. In today’s world, learning is no longer limited to books and classrooms. The use of computers, the internet, projectors, and mobile devices has made learning easier, faster, and more interesting.[math]\textbf{Benefits:}[/math]
 Technology allows students to access information anytime from anywhere. E-books, educational videos, and apps help students understand difficult topics easily. Online classes and virtual exams became common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teachers use multimedia to explain lessons better.[math]\textbf{For Teachers and Institutions:}[/math]
 Teachers can prepare digital lessons, track students’ progress, and communicate through platforms like Google Classroom or Zoom. Schools use smart boards, attendance systems, and result management software. It saves time and improves efficiency.[math]\textbf{Challenges:}[/math]
 Some rural areas lack internet and digital devices. Students from poor families face difficulty buying phones or laptops. Too much screen time may also affect eyesight and attention span.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Technology has made education smarter and more accessible. To build a modern, knowledge-based society, we must use technology wisely and ensure equal access for all students.

Explanation:
A 250-word composition on "The Role of Technology in Education" is appropriate because it gives enough space to present core ideas—improved access to resources, increased engagement, personalized learning, and assessment tools—while remaining focused and coherent. The correct approach treats technology as a supportive tool that enhances pedagogy but requires teacher guidance, digital literacy, and equitable infrastructure to be effective. Grasping this helps students write balanced essays: illustrate benefits with examples, acknowledge challenges like the digital divide, and end with practical, forward-looking recommendations.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Rivers of Bangladesh}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Bangladesh is often referred to as the “Land of Rivers.” There are more than 700 rivers crisscrossing the country. These rivers are not only a gift of nature but also the foundation of the country's agriculture, transportation, trade, and culture.[math]\textbf{Major Rivers:}[/math]
 Some of the major rivers are the Padma, Jamuna, Meghna, Brahmaputra, Teesta, Surma, and Karnaphuli. These rivers help in irrigation, fishing, and connecting remote villages to towns and cities. Rivers are also sacred in religion and celebrated in poems and songs.[math]\textbf{Importance:}[/math]
 Rivers bring fertility to the land by depositing alluvial soil. They are vital for rice and jute farming, which are key agricultural products. People travel by boat through rivers. Fishermen catch hilsa and other fish, earning their livelihood. River ports like Narayanganj and Barisal play a role in national trade.[math]\textbf{Cultural Significance:}[/math]
 Rivers are deeply rooted in Bengali literature and art. Famous poets like Rabindranath Tagore and Jasimuddin wrote beautiful verses inspired by river life. Boat races, festivals, and folk music often happen by the riverside.[math]\textbf{Threats and Protection:}[/math]
 Unfortunately, many rivers are dying due to pollution, illegal grabbing, and overuse. Factories release toxic waste into rivers. Climate change is also affecting water flow. River protection laws and awareness campaigns are urgently needed.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 Rivers are like the blood vessels of Bangladesh. To save our country, we must save our rivers. Proper care and use of rivers will ensure our future prosperity.

Explanation:
The composition is correct because it systematically describes the major rivers (Padma, Jamuna, Meghna), their origins and courses, seasonal behaviors (monsoon floods and erosion), and their economic and cultural importance, all organized into a clear introduction, body, and conclusion to meet the 250-word requirement. Understanding the underlying concept means recognizing that rivers shape Bangladesh’s geography, agriculture, transport, and daily life, so effective writing links physical facts with human effects and examples. To replicate this, students should use accurate facts, simple chronological or thematic structure, and a balanced focus on physical features and social importance.

Question:
Write a composition on [math]\textbf{The Life of a Day Labourer}[/math] in 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math]\textbf{The Life of a Day Labourer}[/math]
 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 A day labourer is a person who earns his living by doing hard physical work on a daily basis. He works in fields, construction sites, factories, and markets. His life is full of struggle and uncertainty. Though his work is vital for society, his condition is often ignored.[math]\textbf{Daily Life:}[/math]
 A day labourer wakes up early in the morning and goes to the labor station or roadside to find work. Sometimes he gets hired; sometimes he returns home empty-handed. He works under the sun or in the rain. His work includes carrying bricks, digging, ploughing fields, or loading goods.[math]\textbf{Living Condition:}[/math]
 Most day labourers live in slums or poor huts. They often do not have access to clean water, electricity, or proper sanitation. Their meals are simple — rice, lentils, or leftover food. They cannot afford good clothes, education for their children, or medical treatment.[math]\textbf{Struggles:}[/math]
 A day labourer’s income is low and irregular. When he falls sick, he loses work and income. During off-seasons, disasters, or lockdowns, their situation becomes worse. Even with honest work, they are often treated without respect by others.[math]\textbf{Importance in Society:}[/math]
 Despite all these struggles, day labourers play a vital role in the development of the country. Roads, buildings, and crops would not exist without their hard work. They are the real builders of the nation.[math]\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]
 We must respect and support day labourers. Government and society should ensure fair wages, housing, healthcare, and education for their children. Their lives deserve dignity and better opportunities.

Explanation:
A good 250-word composition on "The Life of a Day Labourer" is correct because it clearly presents an introduction, a focused body describing daily routine, struggles and resilience, and a concise conclusion while staying within the word limit. The underlying concept is to combine concrete details (work tasks, hours, living conditions) with sensory language and empathy so readers understand both facts and human impact. Keep sentences clear and connected, use specific examples rather than general statements, and end with a reflective remark that highlights the labourer’s dignity or the social lesson.

 [math]\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]
 Books are called the best friends of human beings. They are a great source of knowledge, entertainment, and wisdom.

In this digital age, reading is more important than ever.[math]\textbf{Benefits of Reading:}[/math]
 Reading increases vocabulary and improves communication skills. It enhances imagination and creativity. Books inspire people, motivate them, and change their mindset. Reading also reduces stress, improves memory, and sharpens the brain.[math]\textbf{Types of Books:}[/math]

 Reading books is a lifelong gift. It opens doors to knowledge and new worlds. Everyone should read regularly and make books their true companions.

Explanation:
