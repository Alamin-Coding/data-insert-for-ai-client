Question:
Discipline

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Discipline

The word discipline is derived from a Latin word 'discipulus'. Discipline means obedience to rules. It is necessary for success in life. It also means obedience to orderly conduct.
Everything within the universe is conducted in discipline. Breach of discipline brings downfall. In the world nothing is above discipline. If every man does as he likes, then there will be chaos in the society. So, the importance of discipline is very great. We should follow discipline to be successful in the battle of life.
In the army discipline is essential. Everyone in the army has to lead a strictly disciplined life. If the soldiers do not obey orders, they become at once a mere rabble unfit to do their duty. A small group of military is more capable to control a mob of thousands than a large group of police. It is because the former can act in a disciplined way, while the latter cannot do so.
Discipline is necessary in student life because by learning discipline a student can be a successful citizen in future. The students who learn discipline from their earlylife can tackle any problem in future. So, learning discipline in student life is a must.
The planets move in discipline. They are bound to obey rules and regulations of the universe. As a result, there is no possibility of clash and conflict among them. Thus discipline can be learnt from the disciplined movement of the planets.
The institution that follows discipline runs well. But it fails when it is without discipline. A good institution follows rules and regulations strictly.
Discipline brings success for one who follows it. The great men of the world followed discipline strictly. They never did anything against rules and regulations. All the time they advised the next generation to be disciplined, dutiful, sincere, punctual and gentle.
Discipline is development. Absence of discipline causes downfall in every walk of life. Discipline draws a sharp line of distinction between men and beasts. So, we should be careful of the importance of discipline in our life.

Solution:
The Rivers of Bangladesh
Bangladesh is a land of rivers. They have a great influence on our national and economic life. We get good benefits from them.
Our main rivers are the Padma, the Meghna, the Jamuna, and the Karnaphuli. The Karnaphuli issues from the Lusai Mountains, the other rivers issue from the Himalayas and they all flow into the Bay of Bengal. All these rivers have their branches and tributaries. They spread over the country as a network. Thus these rivers give a new identity to our country as riverine Bangladesh.
The rivers are very useful to our life. They are helpful to our agriculture. We use our river water to irrigate our land. We can store river water during the rainy season and use them in dry season. We can also use the current of these rivers for producing electricity. They are important for water-way communication. They are the sources of fish. Many people lead their lives by catching and selling fish got from rivers.
The people of Bangladesh are greatly influenced by the rivers. The art and culture of our people are also influenced by them. Many poets have written poems on the rivers. Many of our people earn their livelihood from rivers.
However, our rivers are also responsible for floods that destroy our economy. Again, in winter season the rivers get dry. Thus, it causes a serious problem to our agriculture. Bangladesh has more than 230 rivers. They are the gifts of nature. We should take proper steps to get more benefits from them. We should dredge them timely and properly.

Question:
Tree Plantation

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Tree Plantation
Trees are the most important element of nature. Men depend much on trees. Trees provide us with oxygen, food, furniture, etc and take in carbondioxide which is harmful to human beings and all animals. So to say, our life on earth largely depends upon trees. But it is a matter of great regret that we are cutting down trees very unwisely for quick profit. It is really a matter of great concern. 
First, it is important to know what trees do for us. Trees are useful to us in various ways. Man needs oxygen. In every breath we take oxygen in and leave carbon dioxide out. Trees leave oxygen out and take carbon dioxide in. Thus they provide us with the most necessary thing we need on earth. Trees also give us food and shelter. We cannot live without the help of trees.
But at present people are cutting down trees at a large scale. There are many reasons of cutting down trees. Man is cutting them down mainly for firewood and furniture. Every day our population is increasing. So, more firewood and furniture are needed for the additional people.
Tropical rain forests are also being cleared at a high rate. It takes thousands of years to grow a tropical rain forest. But at present they are being cleared at the rate of fourteen square miles per hour.
The effect of deforestation is very harmful and dangerous. For this, 'Greenhouse Effect' has occurred and the temperature of the world is increasing day by day. Heat waves have grasped many countries. Ice is melting in the South and the North Poles. The level of water in the sea is increasing. This may lead to worldwide flood. Measures should immediately be taken to prevent deforestation. We should plant five trees if we cut down one. We should also try our best to stop cutting down trees and save the environment. Otherwise, our future will be very difficult and uninhabitable.

Word meaning: depend on - নির্ভর করা; provide - যোগান দেওয়া; a matter of great regret - অত্যন্ত দুঃখের বিষয়; necessary thing - প্রয়োজনীয় বস্তুসামগ্রী; shelter - আশ্রয়; a large scale - ব্যাপক হ্যার; firewood - জ্বালানির কাঠ; additional people - বাড়তি জনসংখ্যা; tropical - গ্রীষ্ম প্রধান; high rate - উচ্চ হারে; effect of deforestation - বন উজাড় করার ফলাফল বা প্রভাব; heat waves - তাপ প্রবাহ; grasped - গ্রাস করেছে; melting - গলে যাচ্ছে; measures - পদক্ষেপ; otherwise - অন্যথায়; uninhabitable - বসবাসের অযোগ্য।

A Journey by Train
Or, My Experience of a Journey by Train
Or, A Journey I Have Recently Enjoyed

A journey is always pleasurable to all. A journey by train is especially pleasant for everyone. It is because a journey by train is safe and comfortable. Whenever I get a chance to have a journey by train, I never miss it. Last month, I enjoyed a journey by train with my family from Dhaka to Chattogram. We went there to attend the wedding ceremony of my cousin. It was one of the most enjoyable journeys of my life.
On the fixed day, we left home early in the morning and went to Kamalapur Railway Station. The station was very crowded and noisy. We bought tickets and got into the train. I managed my seat beside the window. Suddenly, the train blew its whistle and I jumped. Then the train started.
At first, the train moved slowly. Then it moved in full speed towards Chattogram. It seemed to me that the trees, houses, people and stations all went quickly back to Dhaka. The rhythmic sounds and jerking of the train made me very excited. I wanted to put my head out of the train window, but my parents did not let me. Fresh wind began to enter into our compartment. I looked through the window and saw the beautiful sights. The paddy fields and other trees were very beautiful to look at. They were tossing their heads in the breeze. Suddenly, the train rushed forward crossing a bridge. I saw some sailing boats in the river. Sometimes, our train moved through open fields. I saw the farmers working in the fields and children were playing cricket. All these gave me new and exciting experiences.
Our compartment was crowded. There was no vacant seat. Some of the passengers were talking on various topics. Some were reading newspapers or magazines. Some were sleeping. Sometimes, hawkers came with various items. Our train touched at a few big and small stations. We bought boiled eggs, bananas and green coconuts. When we were entering into Chattogram, we saw many hills.
At last, we reached the destination safe and sound at 4 p.m. By making this journey by train, I got much enjoyment. I wish I could do it again and again.

Question:
The Season I Like Most/The Spring in Bangladesh

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Season I Like Most/The Spring in Bangladesh
There are six seasons in Bangladesh. Spring is one of them. It is the best and the most charming of all the seasons. The Bangla months of Falgun and Chaitra make this season. I like this season most.
Among the seasons, the spring occupies a very high position. To me the winter is very cold, dull and lifeless. In summer, the scorching sun, hot days and nights make life miserable. The heavy rain and frequent floods in the rainy season bring great sufferings for us. The autumn and the late autumn have more or less the disadvantages of the rainy season and the winter respectively. But the spring has none of the inconveniences of these seasons. Coming after winter, it captivates the hearts of all.
With the arrival of the spring, nature puts on a lively look. Everything of nature looks fresh. The sky looks clear and blue, trees put forth new leaves, flowers of charming colour and scent bloom in trees. Bees and butterflies hum and fly from one flower to another. During this season, gentle breeze begins to blow. Sweet twitters of birds are heard. The melodious notes of the cuckoo please our ears.
All these charming and pleasing sights and sounds have a positive influence on our mind. Everywhere there is joy and mirth. People enjoy a better health. They are happier in this season. Besides, various kinds of vegetables and fruits are also available in this time.
The season lasts for a very short period. During this season, some people suffer from some diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, chicken-pox. Pox is a common disease in this season.
In spite of its few disadvantages, its advantages are more. Truly speaking, its actual stay in Bangladesh is not more than two or three weeks. Perhaps its short stay has made it dearer to us. For all these reasons, I like spring most.

Word meaning: spring - বসন্তকাল; dull and lifeless - বিষা এবং প্রাণহীন; scorching sun - প্রখর রোদ; miserable - দুর্বিসহ/দুঃসহনীয়; flood - বন্যা ; suffering - ভোগান্তি; disadvantage - অসুবিধা; inconvenience - অসুবিধা/বিড়ম্বনা/কষ্ট/পীড়া; captivate - বিমোহিত/বিমুগ্ধ/সম্মোহিত করা; nature looks fresh - প্রকৃতিকে সতেজ দেখায়; sky looks clear and blue - আকাশ পরিষ্কার এবং নীল দেখায়; trees put forth new leaves - গাছে গাছে নতুন পাতা গজায়; melodious - সুরেলা; cuckoo - কোকিল; joy and mirth - আনন্দ এবং আমোদ-আহ্লাদ; diseases - রোগজীবাণু/রোগ/অসুখ; in spite of - সত্ত্বেও।

Question:
Floods in Bangladesh

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Floods in Bangladesh
Flood means overflow of water. Bangladesh, being a land of rivers, often falls victims to floods almost every year. When it takes place seriously, it weakens our hopes of prosperity. It is devastating and horrible at it causes a colossal loss to lives and properties. It is like a curse of nature on us.
Heavy rainfall often causes flood. Blockage of water also causes flood. In our country, flood is caused mainly due to heavy rainfall, blockage of water and release of too much water from the Farakka Barrage. Flood may also be caused by cyclones, tidal bores or melting of ice of mountains.
Floods cause great havocs and sufferings to millions of people. Houses and cattle are washed away. Crops are damaged and many lives and properties are lost. Streets and roads go under water. People cannot go from one place to another. It makes rich people poor and poor people distressed.
The after effect of flood is very dangerous. Diarrhoea and other water-borne diseases break out after a flood. There is a scarcity of food and pure drinking water all around. The areas affected by flood become muddy and unhealthy. The prices of all daily necessary goods go up.
The government tries to take proper steps for the sufferers. Some voluntary organisations and NGOs help the affected people. They provide relief goods, medicines etc to them.
It is not an easy task to check floods. Firstly, drainage system should be improved. Secondly, river beds should be dredged. Thirdly, a well planned irrigation system should be introduced. Fourthly, we should build our houses on high land.
Flood has some good sides too. Silt scatters on lands and it makes the soil fertile. Sometimes various kinds of crops grow more on these fertile lands. Then we get bumper crops.
Flood is usually a great curse to us. It destroys our hopes and aspirations. Long term measures should be taken to control floods.

From dawn to dusk we see many kinds of birds here and there. Their difference in colour, size and nature fascinates us.
The cuckoo, the doel, the bau-katha-kao, the shama, the moyna, the koel are prominent singing birds of Bangladesh. The cuckoo is the most popular of all singing birds. It appears at the advent of the spring. The doel is our national bird.
Another familiar bird in our country is the crow. When it caws at dawn, we know that the night is over. It is very clever but its voice is harsh and it looks ugly. It steals foods. It is very unpopular. Very often sitting upon electric wires or trees it empties its bowel upon passer-by.
The dove, the pigeon, the heron, the partridge, the goose are some common birds of Bangladesh. Their meat is tasty and delicious. The sparrow is another common bird.
The parrot and the moyna are talking birds. They can imitate the voice of man. So some people keep them as pets.
The kite, the hawk and the vulture are the birds of prey. They prey upon chickens and ducklings. The crane and the kingfisher are found near watery places. They live on fish. The woodpecker is a pretty bird with a strong bill. These birtis have keen eyes and sharp nails.
The birds of our country are our valuable assets. In many respects they are helpful to us. Many of them help in spreading the seeds of trees in different places. Thus they help in afforestation. Some of them eat up rubbish and many harmful insects and worms. Others add to the beauty of Nature. So we should not kill birds. We should plant more trees to provide them with dwelling places.

Question:
Anti-discrimination Student Movement

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Anti-discrimination Student Movement
The Anti-discrimination Student Movement was a big incident in Bangladesh in July 2024. It started as the students were unhappy about the government's quota system for jobs.
In June 2024, the High Court announced a 30% quota for the children of freedom fighters in government jobs. There were already quotas for other groups, which meant only 44% of jobs were left for general applicants. The students thought this was unfair and wanted a change.
This protest was not the first one. Similar protests took place in 2013 and 2018. This time, the students took to the streets again. They blocked roads and became very serious about the protest. The protests grew stronger gradually. On July 15, some armed people attacked the students, injuring many. The protests became more violent, and many students were hurt. The students then turned their protest against the government. On August 3, they made one demand: the government must resign.
Finally, on August 5, the Prime Minister stepped down. The students' unity and hard work helped bring down the government and changed the future of Bangladesh.

Hobby means one's favourite occupation. It is usually done during leisure. It does not give one money, but gives much pleasure. Every man has his own favourite hobby. There are many kinds of hobbies like singing, painting. reading, stamp collecting, coin collecting. angling. gardening and so on. I have my own favourite hobby. It is gardening.
I love flowers very much. So, I have made a flower garden. It is in front of our house. I have planted the seedlings of roses, jasmines, jabas, sun-flowers and many other seasonal flowers. Every morning I water the plants, till the soil and take care of the plants. In the evening, I water them again. On holidays, I pass some time there. I have put a bamboo-made fence around my garden. For this, cattle and other animals cannot enter into it.
My hobby is favourite to me because it keeps me cheerful. When I am bored with my studies or other works, I go to my garden. The pleasant sight of my garden and the sweet scent of the flowers remove my boredom. It is a great source of joy and recreation for me. I think, no other hobby can give me as much joy as this one.
This hobby is very beneficial to me. Before I made this garden, I was a sickly boy. I had lost my appetite and became very weak. But when I started this garden and worked in it, my health improved. Now I am quite a healthy young man. Besides this, I grow vegetables in a corner of the garden. It saves a lot of family expenses.
A hobby is necessary in every man's life. But we must not pass much of our time in our hobbies. We must do our main jobs first and then we should pass our leisure time in our hobbies.
