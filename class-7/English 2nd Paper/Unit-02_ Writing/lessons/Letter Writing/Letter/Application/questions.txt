Solution:
41 Malibag, Dhaka
04 February 2025

My dear Hena,
Great love to you. I hope you are passing happy days. Today I am giving you the description of a picnic that we enjoyed last Friday. Unluckily I missed you. We went to Sonargaon in Narayanganj. It is famous for its historical importance. There are several ancient buildings, gardens, dresses, arms, sculptures, earthen-wares, straw-made houses, Nakshi Kantha etc at Sonargaon. A large pond adds to the beauty of the place. We went there by a private car and took our lunch there. At noon, we enjoyed a grand feast. We made much fun and cut jokes. We also moved around the place and saw many beautiful things. We took many photographs with our teachers and friends. The natural scenery attracted us very much. Before evening we returned to Dhaka. We enjoyed the picnic very much.
No more today. With best love to you and regards to your parents.

Yours ever,
Rubina

My dear Munir,
Hope, you are well by Allahs grace. From a reliable source, I have come to learn that you have started smoking. I have been very much shocked at this. Dear Munir, you know that smoking is surely dangerous for our health. When you will be addicted to smoking, it will cost a lot. It will lead you to various diseases. Smoking is full of poisonous elements that are very harmful for your mental and physical health. So, as a friend, I do request you not to smoke, again. Please be serious to avoid it. I pray to Allah that He may help you to get rid of this bad habit.
No more today. Tender my best compliments to your parents and affection to little ones.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Chattogram
10 January 2025

My dear Sakiba,
Hope you are quite well by the grace of Allah. In your last letter you have wanted to know about my aim in life. Well, here I am writing to you about it. I have fixed an aim in my life and it is to be a physician (or doctor). After my SSC Examination, I shall study in the same group in the HSC course. After passing the HSC Examination with a good result, I intend to get myself admitted into a medical college for an MBBS degree. The profession of a physician is very noble and humanitarian. In my village, there is no qualified physician. The villagers suffer from various diseases and die premature deaths. Besides, my parents want that I should be a physician. After completing MBBS course, I shall come back to my village and serve my villagers. I shall take no fee from the poor. I have also a great dream to establish a small hospital in the village. There will exist all modern medical facilities in it. Here the poor patients will be treated without any fee and they will get medicines at half of the price. I earnestly pray to Allah for fulfilling my noble aim and I am also working hard to reach my goal.
No more today. Please convey my best regards to your parents and love to Tunu.

Yours ever,
Nabila

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
House no-137, Mirpur-10, Dhaka
12 April 2025

Dear Grace,
How are you in Canada? I hope you are doing well. I want to share some exciting news that has made my life much easier.
Our city now has a metro rail and I use it every day. It has saved me a lot of time and trouble. Before, my journey to college was stressful and slow because of traffic jams. It took more than an hour by bus or auto-rickshaw. Now, the metro rail takes only 20 minutes! The metro rail is fast, comfortable and affordable. It runs on time. So, I do not worry about being late. I can relax and enjoy the ride instead of being stuck in traffic. It also gives me more time to get ready in the morning.
This new metro rail has made my life better. When you visit, we can take a ride together.
Take care.

Your loving friend,
Purnota

Hope you are well by Allahs grace. In your last letter you have wanted to know about the prize giving ceremony of our school.
Well, for your interest I am giving a short description of it. Last week prize giving ceremony of our school was held. It was a very enjoyable and interesting one. It was held in our large school auditorium. The chief guest took his chair at the right time. At 9 am the ceremony started with our National Anthem. Our Headteacher read out the final report. The winners received prizes from the chief guest by turns. I myself got two prizes for good results and modesty. Before the end of the ceremony, a comedy by Shakespeare was staged to entertain all of us. It was really a ceremony of joy and pleasures for us.
No more today. Love to you and all of your family.

Yours ever,
Mahmud

Village: Baruipara, PO: Tala, District: Satkhira
07 March 2025

My dear Tiya,
Hope, this letter will find you hale and hearty. I have come to learn that you are not willing enough to learn English. The marks that you have got in English in your last examination is not quite satisfactory. It is because you do not pay proper attention to English. English is an international language. Without learning English nobody can reach the goal of success. It helps one in many ways. Those who neglect learning it can never shine in life. So, it is a must for you to realize the usefulness of English and learn this language.
No more today. With heartfelt love to everybody of your family.

Question:
Write a letter to your younger brother/sister informing him/her of the causes, effects/symptoms and prevention of dengue fever.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
130/B College Road, Bogura
5 August 2025

Dear Ritu,
I hope you are doing well in your studies. I am worried about the dengue outbreak in the country. Please be careful.
Do you know the symptoms of dengue fever? Let me explain. Symptoms appear 4 to 6 days after infection and last up to 10 days. These include high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, and mild bleeding. In severe cases, it can cause massive bleeding, shock, or even death. There is no specific cure for dengue. Doctors suggest rest, drinking lots of fluids and taking paracetamol.
Since there is no proper cure, we must prevent it. To avoid mosquito bites, use repellents and mosquito nets while sleeping. Reduce mosquito breeding by keeping your surroundings clean and avoiding stagnant water. Take care of yourself and your family.

Your loving sister,
Tammi

Dear Sir,
I have the honour to lay before you the following fact for your kind consideration. I have been studying in your school for the last four years and have always come out first in my examinations. But the financial condition of my father is not at all well. He is a petty clerk of a private firm. He has to maintain our large family. As a result, he is not capable of helping me financially to continue my studies.
I, therefore, hope that you would be kind enough to grant me a full free-studentship so that I can continue my studies properly.

This is to inform you that we, the students of your institution, would like to draw your attention to the fact that we have a library in our school. But it cannot provide us with enough books.

Therefore, we earnestly request you to contact Bishwa Shahitto Kendro and ask them to provide our library with books.
We are looking forward to a positive response.

Math Teacher

Subject: Application seeking apology for disturbing other examinees.

Respected Madam,
I am really very sorry for disturbing other examinees in the exam hall during the Mathematics test today. I know you have taught us that disturbing others in the exam hall is wrong and it is good to try everything on our own. But I was so badly nervous that I could not solve the problems which were actually very easy. That is why, I disturbed my friends. However, I now bitterly regret my action and promise never to do it again.
I would be grateful to you if you please forgive me for my offence.
