What type of letter is mentioned in the learning outcomes?

Options:
a. Formal letter
b. Informal letter
c. Business letter
d. Application letter


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: পাঠ্যফলের বিবরণ থেকে বোঝা যায় যে এখানে ব্যক্তিগত বা অনানুষ্ঠানিক যোগাযোগের ধরন অভিপ্রেত, অর্থাৎ একটি অনৌপচারিক চিঠি উল্লেখ আছে।  
Step 2: তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো বিকল্প b: Informal letter।  
Step 3: অন্যগুলো ভুল কারণ—Formal letter অফিসিয়াল ও শীষ্ট ভাষার জন্য, Business letter ব্যবসায়িক উদ্দেশ্যে এবং Application letter চাকরি/ভর্তি ইত্যাদির জন্য আবেদন করার চিঠি; এগুলো অনৌপচারিক চিঠির মতো ব্যক্তিগত টোন হয় না।

Question:
The narrator of the story is __________.

Options:
a. a coach
b. the team doctor
c. a friend of Ashish and Arun
d. a teacher


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Notice the narrator's voice — the narrator speaks in first person and describes personal feelings and direct, informal knowledge about Ashish and Arun.
Step 2: That intimate, conversational perspective indicates a close personal relationship rather than a professional role.
Step 3: Eliminate the other options: a coach or the team doctor would use role-specific, professional language and focus on coaching/medical duties; a teacher would adopt a more formal or authoritative tone. Therefore the narrator is a friend of Ashish and Arun — correct answer: c.

Question:
What does the team manager do during practices?

Options:
a. Gives medical advice
b. Keeps a record of performance
c. Trains the players
d. Selects the best players


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the typical duties of a team manager during practice — mainly administrative and organizational tasks such as monitoring attendance, scheduling, and keeping performance records.  
Step 2: Match each option to usual roles: a (gives medical advice) is the doctor/physio's role; c (trains the players) and d (selects the best players) are the coach/selector's roles.  
Step 3: Therefore option b (keeps a record of performance) correctly describes what a team manager does during practices.

Question:
The text mentions that the coach is involved in selecting the team daily.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the statement to verify — "the coach is involved in selecting the team daily."  
Step 2: Compare with the passage: the passage indicates team selection is handled by the selection committee/manager or decided per match, not as a daily duty of the coach.  
Step 3: Conclude that the statement contradicts the passage, so it is false.

Therefore the correct answer is (b) False. Option (a) is incorrect because the text does not state that the coach selects the team on a daily basis.

Options:


Correct Answer: He feels it's a wonderful experience.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence or passage describing Ashish’s reaction to going home and identify the exact words he uses.  
Step 2: The text explicitly presents his reaction as positive — he describes going home as “a wonderful experience,” showing joy and appreciation.

Question:
Every Thursday at 4 o'clock, Ashish's __________ begins.

Options:
a. practice
b. match
c. walk
d. cycling


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence and note that something scheduled (an event or activity) "begins" at a fixed time every Thursday.  
Step 2: Of the choices, "match" best fits the phrasing "begins" for a scheduled event that starts at a specific time; therefore the natural completion is "Ashish's match begins."  
Briefly why others are less suitable: "practice" could fit but is less specific for a one-time scheduled event; "walk" and "cycling" are usually phrased as "goes for a walk" or "goes cycling" rather than "begins."  
Correct answer: b (match).

Options:
a. The team manager
b. The coach
c. The team doctor
d. The players themselves


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:

Step 2: The person whose explicit duty is to look after injuries, give medical treatment, and manage players’ fitness and recovery is the team doctor.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is (c) the team doctor; the manager and coach have non-medical roles and the players themselves are not the professional medical caregivers.
