Question:
What did Anwar work for?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Approach: Identify the phrase that answers "What did Anwar work for?" — the question asks for the organization or employer associated with Anwar.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Understand the question: "work for" asks about the organization or employer.
2. Locate the relevant information: the provided correct answer states the employer explicitly.
3. Interpret the statement: an NGO named "Save the Earth" is the organization Anwar was employed by.

Answer:
An NGO called Save the Earth.

Explanation:
The passage explicitly says Anwar worked for an NGO called "Save the Earth," so that is the correct answer. To find such answers, look for direct statements in the text that name a person's employer or workplace.

Question:
According to the text, what is a consequence of rising sea levels in Bangladesh?

Options:


Correct Answer: 3.5 million people may become homeless

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach — locate the statement in the text that links sea-level rise to human impacts and extract the quantified consequence.

Working steps and reasoning:
1. Identify cause and effect in the text: the cause is rising sea levels; the effect concerns human displacement in Bangladesh.
2. Interpret the mechanisms: rising sea levels lead to increased coastal flooding, permanent inundation of low-lying areas, and salinization of land and water supplies. These processes destroy or render homes uninhabitable and undermine livelihoods.
3. Extract the quantified consequence given in the text: the text states that as a result of these impacts, 3.5 million people may become homeless.
4. Conclude logically: therefore, the direct consequence of rising sea levels in Bangladesh (as stated) is that 3.5 million people may lose their homes and become homeless.

Relevant concepts:
- Sea-level rise → coastal inundation and erosion
- Vulnerability of low-lying deltaic regions (like Bangladesh)
- Human displacement as a social consequence of environmental change

Final answer: 3.5 million people may become homeless.

Explanation:
Rising sea levels will flood and erode low-lying coastal areas of Bangladesh, destroying homes and land, so about 3.5 million people may become homeless. Bangladesh’s flat, densely populated coast is especially vulnerable, so even moderate sea-level rise forces large numbers of people to leave their homes.

Question:
Which of the following is a suggested action to combat climate change?

Options:


Correct Answer: Use energy-saving bulbs

Solution:
Solution:
Answer: Use energy-saving bulbs.

Answer approach:
- Identify the action and explain how it reduces climate change drivers (greenhouse gas emissions) through energy efficiency.

Essential steps and reasoning:
1. Energy-saving bulbs (LEDs or CFLs) use less electrical power to produce the same light compared with incandescent bulbs. Lower electricity use means less fuel burned at power plants, so fewer greenhouse gas emissions.
2. Efficiency principle: reducing energy consumption for the same service reduces total emissions proportional to the electricity saved and the grid’s emission factor.
3. Additional benefits: longer lifetime (fewer replacements → less manufacturing and waste) and lower household electricity bills.

Illustrative example (compact):
- Replacing a [math]60\text{ W}[/math] incandescent with a [math]10\text{ W}[/math] LED saves [math]60-10=50\text{ W}[/math] or [math]0.05\text{ kW}[/math].
- If the bulb is used [math]5[/math] hours/day, daily energy saved is [math]0.05\times5=0.25\text{ kWh}[/math]; yearly that is about [math]0.25\times365\approx91.25\text{ kWh}[/math].
- With a grid emission factor of [math]0.5\text{ kg CO}_2/\text{kWh}[/math], annual CO2 avoided ≈ [math]91.25\times0.5\approx45.6\text{ kg CO}_2[/math].

Conclusion:
Using energy-saving bulbs is a practical, cost-effective action that reduces electricity demand and associated greenhouse gas emissions, making it a recommended measure to help combat climate change.

Explanation:
Using energy-saving bulbs (like LEDs) reduces electricity use, which lowers carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Because less energy is needed, fewer fossil fuels are burned, so switching to these bulbs is a simple, effective way to help combat climate change.

Question:
What does the term 'climate shift' refer to in the context of the text?

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:

উত্তর: "climate shift" বলতে মৌসুমের প্রচলিত ক্রম, সময় বা চরিত্রে হওয়া পরিবর্তনকে বোঝায় — অর্থাৎ মৌসুমগুলোর সাধারণ রীতিমতো নিয়মে পরিবর্তন।

উত্তর প্রদানের পদ্ধতি ও যুক্তি:
1. সংজ্ঞা নির্ধারণ: প্রথমে মূল শব্দের মানে ধরা হয় — climate (আবহাওয়া/জলবায়ু) এবং shift (পরিবর্তন/স্থানান্তর)।  
2. প্রাসঙ্গিক ধারণা: এখানে বুঝাতে চাওয়া হচ্ছে মৌসুমগুলোর স্বাভাবিক প্যাটার্ন (যেমন বর্ষা কখন শুরু হয়, শীত কতো দিন থাকে, গ্রীষ্মের তীব্রতা ইত্যাদি) যদি আলাদা হয়ে যায় তবে সেটাই climate shift।  
3. শনাক্তকরণ ও লক্ষণ: সাধারণত সময়গত পরিবর্তন (মৌসুম শুরু/শেষে বিলম্ব বা ত্বরান্বিত হওয়া), কোথাও কোনো মৌসুম দীর্ঘ বা সংক্ষিপ্ত হওয়া, তাপমাত্রা/বৃষ্টিপাতের ধরণ বদল — এসব মিলিয়েই বলা হয় climate shift।  
4. যুক্তি: যেহেতু শব্দগুচ্ছটি মৌসুমের "usual pattern" — অর্থাৎ প্রচলিত নিয়ম—এর পরিবর্তন নির্দেশ করে, তাই সংক্ষিপ্ত সঠিক ব্যাখ্যা হচ্ছে "A change in the usual pattern of seasons"।  

উদাহরণ (সংক্ষেপে, প্রয়োজনে বোঝার জন্য): বর্ষা আগে বা পরে আসা, শীতের সময় হঠাৎ কমে যাওয়া বা গরমের মৌসুম দীর্ঘ হওয়া — এগুলোই climate shift-এর সাধারণ প্রকাশ।

Explanation:
A climate shift means the long-term patterns of weather and seasons change, so the usual timing, intensity or duration of seasons is altered. That is why "a change in the usual pattern of seasons" correctly describes a climate shift — it refers to lasting changes in how seasons behave rather than a single weather event.

Question:
What is one of the major impacts of climate change mentioned in the text?

Options:


Correct Answer: Seasons are shifting

Solution:
Solution:
Answer approach:
Identify the direct statement from the text about a major impact and explain briefly why that impact follows from climate change.

Steps and reasoning:
1. Key statement: The text mentions that one major impact is that seasons are shifting.
2. Relevant concept: Climate change (global warming and altered atmospheric patterns) changes average temperatures and the timing of seasonal cues (temperature, day length interactions, precipitation).
3. Logical link: As global temperatures rise and weather patterns change, the onset and length of seasons (for example, spring arriving earlier or winters becoming shorter/milder) shift in time and intensity. This is a direct consequence of sustained changes in climate variables.
4. Consequences (brief): Shifted seasons affect ecosystems (plants bloom earlier, animal migrations change), agriculture (planting/harvest schedules), and human activities that depend on predictable seasonal timing.

Example (illustrative):
- Many regions now observe earlier spring blooming of flowers and trees, which demonstrates how seasons are occurring at different times than historically expected.

Final answer:
One of the major impacts of climate change mentioned in the text is that seasons are shifting.

Explanation:
Seasons are shifting is correct because rising global temperatures change the timing and intensity of seasonal patterns, so events like spring flowering, animal migrations, and the onset of winter occur earlier or later than before. These timing changes (phenological shifts) disrupt ecosystems and agriculture, since plants, animals, and farming practices rely on predictable seasonal cues.
