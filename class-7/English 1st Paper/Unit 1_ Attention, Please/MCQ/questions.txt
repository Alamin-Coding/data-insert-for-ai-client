Question:
Farabi felt __________ when he realized his friend dropped him from the football team.

Options:
a. happy
b. fearful
c. sad
d. excited


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the situation — being dropped from the football team is a negative, disappointing event for Farabi.  
Step 2: Determine the most likely emotional reaction — disappointment and loss typically correspond to feeling sad.  
Therefore the correct choice is c: sad. Options a (happy) and d (excited) are positive emotions that don't fit being excluded, and b (fearful) implies anxiety rather than the disappointment implied here.

Question:
What was the atmosphere during the prize-giving day?

Options:


Correct Answer: The auditorium was brightly decorated and filled with students and guardians.

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নে দেওয়া বর্ণনা থেকে মূল বাক্যটি শনাক্ত করুন — অনুষ্ঠানের দিন অডিটোরিয়ামটি উজ্জ্বলভাবে সজ্জিত ছিল এবং শিক্ষার্থী ও অভিভাবকরা ভরে ছিল।  
ধাপ ২: প্রদত্ত বিকল্পগুলোর সঙ্গে মিলিয়ে দেখুন — যে বিকল্পটি বলে "অডিটোরিয়ামটি উজ্জ্বলভাবে সজ্জিত এবং শিক্ষার্থী ও অভিভাবকরা ভরে ছিলেন" সেটিই সরাসরি মিলে যায়, তাই সেটি সঠিক।  
ধাপ ৩: অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো বাতিল করুন — উদাহরণস্বরূপ, খ যদি বলে "শান্ত ও খালি ছিল" বা গ যদি বলে "গভীরভাবে নীরস ছিল", সেগুলো প্রশ্নের বর্ণনার বিপরীত হওয়ার কারণে ভুল।  

অতএব সঠিক উত্তর: অডিটোরিয়ামটি উজ্জ্বলভাবে সজ্জিত এবং শিক্ষার্থী ও অভিভাবকরা ভরে ছিলেন।

Question:
Flora can __________ her first day at school clearly.

Options:
a. forget
b. recall
c. ignore
d. dislike


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the sentence for meaning and grammar — "Flora can ___ her first day at school clearly" needs a verb that means "to remember" and fits with "clearly."

Step 2: Consider each option:
- forget — means to be unable to remember (opposite of the required meaning).
- recall — means to remember or bring back to mind, and pairs naturally with "clearly."
- ignore — means to deliberately pay no attention (doesn't match context).
- dislike — means to not like (not about memory).

Step 3: Choose the best fit — "recall" correctly expresses that Flora remembers her first day clearly. Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
Farabi has a negative attitude towards the football tournament.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the evidence in the given text (words or actions) that express Farabi’s feelings about the football tournament — for example phrases showing dislike, criticism, or refusal to participate.  
Step 2: Interpret those expressions as a negative attitude toward the tournament (they indicate unfavorable opinion or reluctance).  
Step 3: Conclude that the statement "Farabi has a negative attitude towards the football tournament" is True, so option (a) is correct. Option (b) is incorrect because it contradicts the explicit negative sentiments shown by Farabi in the passage.

Question:
What did Flora and Farabi do on the school holiday?

Options:
a. Go to a picnic
b. Visit each other
c. Study at home
d. Play outside


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question to identify the action asked about — what Flora and Farabi did on the school holiday.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that action and choose the one that directly describes them meeting: "Visit each other" matches the idea that they went to see one another.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: "Go to a picnic" implies a group outing, "Study at home" implies they stayed apart and worked, and "Play outside" implies outdoor play rather than visiting.  
Therefore the correct answer is option b: Visit each other.

Question:
What did Flora's mother tell her the day before she started school?

Options:


Correct Answer: Flora's mother told her that she was going to start school the next day.

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Interpret the time reference "the day before she started school": this means the mother spoke one day earlier about what would happen the following day. Step 2 — Understand the content: the mother's message was that Flora would start school the next day. Therefore the correct answer is that Flora's mother told her she was going to start school the next day; any other option contradicts the clear time-reference and so is incorrect.

Question:
The principal praised the school's __________ and exam results.

Options:
a. facilities
b. students
c. performance
d. teachers


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the phrase that naturally pairs with "exam results" in meaning and collocation.  
Step 2: "Performance" is an abstract measure like "exam results," so "the school's performance and exam results" is a natural, parallel construction. Therefore option c is correct.

Briefly why others are less suitable:
- a (facilities): refers to physical resources, not directly comparable to "exam results."  
- b (students) and d (teachers): grammatically possible but less idiomatic in this context; praising "the school's performance" is the clearest and most common collocation with "exam results."

Question:
The story suggests writing good deeds on stone.

Options:
a. True
b. False


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement — the story explicitly uses the image of writing good deeds on stone to emphasize their permanence.  
Step 2: The phrase "write on stone" is a clear metaphor meaning to record or preserve good deeds permanently, so the statement matches the story's message.  
Step 3: Conclusion — the correct answer is True (option a); option b is incorrect because it contradicts the story's explicit suggestion.

Question:
What can we infer about what Flora and Farabi value in their friendship?

Options:
a. Honesty
b. Forgiveness
c. Competition
d. Trust


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Observe the behavior — Flora and Farabi reconcile or continue their friendship despite a mistake or disagreement, which directly shows they forgive each other.  
Step 2: Infer the value — this pattern indicates they value b forgiveness, since forgiveness explains why their friendship endures after conflicts.  
Step 3: Why other options are less likely — honesty and trust might be present but aren’t explicitly shown by the reconciliation, and competition is contradicted by their cooperative, forgiving response.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The Head Teacher thought Flora answered the questions intelligently — he praised her clear, sensible replies during the interview, so option (b) is correct. Options (a), (c) and (d) are incorrect because being nervous or not knowing anything would contradict the description of intelligent answers, and there is no indication he found her unsuitable.

Describe how Flora felt on her first day of school.

Options:


Correct Answer: She felt nervous and excited.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the descriptive words in the passage about Flora’s first day — the text explicitly mentions feelings of both nervousness and excitement.  
Step 2: Combine those descriptors into a single concise answer because they are not mutually exclusive; someone can be nervous and excited at the same time.  
Therefore the correct answer is: She felt nervous and excited. Options that state only one emotion are incorrect because they omit the other feeling described.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

The text explicitly indicates the friend “slapped” her, so match that verb to the options and select (b). Options (a) helped, (c) ignored, and (d) cheered do not match the described action, so they are incorrect.

Therefore the correct answer is (a) True. Option (b) "False" is incorrect because it contradicts the clear statement that Flora "felt excited."

Question:
What event are Flora and Farabi discussing?

Options:
a. A picnic
b. A prize-giving ceremony
c. A sports day
d. A school play


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From Flora and Farabi’s dialogue we pick out keywords like “prize”, “awards”, “certificates” and references to winners or presenting honours.  
Step 2: Those words directly indicate an event where prizes are handed out, i.e. a prize-giving ceremony.  
Why other options are wrong: a picnic would mention food/outdoors, c sports day would mention races or games, and d a school play would mention rehearsals or performances — none of which appear in their conversation.
