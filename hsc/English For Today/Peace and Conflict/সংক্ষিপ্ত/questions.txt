Question:
How do the experiences of the old man in Hemingway's story and the narrators in the Gaza monologues reflect the theme of loss and the emotional toll of conflict on individuals and their relationships with loved ones?

Options:


Correct Answer: Both highlight profound emotional distress caused by separation from loved ones due to war.

Solution:


Explanation:
Both works show how forced separation and violence break personal bonds, leaving characters with grief, helplessness, and longing for lost loved ones. The old man’s loneliness and the Gaza narrators’ accounts use specific memories and daily losses to make that emotional pain concrete. Together they underline that war’s damage is not only physical but also deep, lasting harm to relationships and inner life.
