What is the main message of the proverb, "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed them for a lifetime?"

Options:
a. Education is not important.
b. Knowledge lasts longer than material goods.
c. Learning is difficult.
d. Fishing is an easy task.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish provides immediate, short-term help, while teaching to fish provides a lasting skill that allows self-sufficiency.  
Step 2: Compare meanings to the options: option b ("Knowledge lasts longer than material goods") directly matches the proverb’s contrast between temporary aid and enduring ability.  
Step 3: Reject the others: option a contradicts the proverb, option c is unrelated, and option d is literal and misses the intended moral.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Step 2: প্রতিটি বিকল্পকে সেই মানদণ্ডের আলোকে মূল্যায়ন করুন: a–বিষয় কমালে বিষয়ভিত্তিক বিস্তার ও দক্ষতা সীমিত হতে পারে; b–স্থানীয় সাংস্কৃতিক চর্চা পাঠ্যক্রমে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করলে শেখা প্রাসঙ্গিক, উৎসাহজনক এবং সাংস্কৃতিক পরিচয়ের সাথে সঙ্গতিপূর্ণ হয়; c–দলগত কাজ নিরুৎসাহিত করা সহযোগিতা ও সমালোচনামূলক চিন্তা কমায়; d–নির্দেশনা ছাড়া বাড়তি হোমওয়ার্ক শিক্ষার্থীর ওপর অপ্রয়োজনীয় বোঝা বাড়ায়।

Options:
a. Education is unnecessary.
b. Education provides a temporary solution.
c. Education is vital for long-term well-being.
d. Education is only for the wealthy.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Parable-এর ঘটনাটিতে দেখানো হয় যে যে কাজটিকে শুধু ক্ষণস্থায়ী সমাধান হিসেবে করা হয় তা সময়ের সঙ্গে চলতে পারে না, আর ধারাবাহিক শিক্ষা বা জ্ঞান দীর্ঘমেয়াদে নিরাপত্তা ও কল্যাণ নিশ্চিত করে।  
Step 2: তাই মূল শিক্ষা হলো শিক্ষা বা জ্ঞান দীর্ঘকালীন কল্যাণের জন্য অপরিহার্য — যেটা সরাসরি option c-কে সমর্থন করে।  
Step 3: অন্য অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ: a সম্পূর্ণ বিপরীত দাবি করে; b শুধুই সাময়িক সমাধান বলছে যা কাহিনীর মূল ভাবের সঙ্গে মেলে না; d অযথা শিক্ষা কে শ্রেণিভিত্তিক করে তোলে, যা কাহিনীর বার্তার সঙ্গে খাপ খায় না।

Why did the King decide to educate the parrot?

Options:
a. The parrot was a royal pet.
b. It was causing trouble in the market.
c. The parrot could sing beautifully.
d. The King wanted to impress his friends.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Step 1: Read the question and identify the motive—why the King would take action regarding the parrot. Step 2: Among the options, only b ("It was causing trouble in the market") gives a clear practical reason for the King to educate the bird to stop the problem. Step 3: Therefore option b is correct; the other choices are less convincing because being a royal pet (a) or singing beautifully (c) are not reasons to educate it to change behavior, and impressing friends (d) is a weak motive compared to solving a market disturbance.

Options:
a. The King wanted to see the parrot fly.
b. The King sought to verify the effectiveness of education.
c. The King was bored and wanted entertainment.
d. The King wanted to increase funding.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: In the story the King comes to the school, watches lessons and questions pupils to see what they have learned — these actions show he wants to assess how well education is working.  
Step 2: That intention matches option b: the King sought to verify the effectiveness of education.  
Step 3: Other choices are incorrect because (a) there is no emphasis on a parrot or its flying, (c) nothing indicates the King visited out of boredom or for mere entertainment, and (d) the story gives no hint he came to increase funding.

How does the story reflect on the theme of education in society?

Options:
a. It shows that education is only for the rich.
b. It emphasizes the need for practical knowledge.
c. It highlights the superficial aspects of education.
d. It promotes rote memorization.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the theme: read the story for how education is portrayed (what characters value, what social reactions are shown).  
Step 2 — Find evidence: the narrative focuses on appearances, credentials, and social standing tied to schooling rather than real learning or useful skills. That shows education treated as a social badge or performance.  
Step 3 — Match to options: this matches option c (highlights the superficial aspects of education).  
Step 4 — Eliminate others: option a (“only for the rich”) is too narrow unless the story explicitly ties schooling to wealth; option b (“emphasizes practical knowledge”) contradicts the story’s focus on appearance; option d (“promotes rote memorization”) is about learning method, not the social superficiality emphasized.  

Therefore the correct answer is c.

Question:
Compare the parrot's experience in the story with a local student’s challenges in learning today. What similarities can you identify?

Options:
a. Both have access to technology.
b. Both face distractions and a lack of practical application.
c. Both are always successful.
d. Both are encouraged by teachers.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the parrot’s experience — it imitates words without real understanding or useful application and is affected by its surroundings (distractions).
Step 2: Identify a local student’s challenges — many students face distractions, rely on rote memorization, and rarely see practical application of what they learn.
Step 3: Compare and conclude — the clear similarity is that both suffer from distractions and a lack of practical application, so option (b) is correct.

Why the other options are incorrect:
- (a) Both have access to technology — not true for the parrot and not universally true for all students.
- (c) Both are always successful — false; both can fail or not achieve meaningful learning.
- (d) Both are encouraged by teachers — not necessarily true for the parrot and not universally true for students.

What is the ultimate goal of education according to the proverb, "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime?"

Options:
a. To provide immediate food
b. To empower individuals for life
c. To give them a job
d. To entertain them


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Interpret the proverb: "Give a person a fish" represents a short-term aid, while "teach a person to fish" represents imparting a lasting skill. Step 2 — Relate to education: the proverb emphasizes building capability and self-reliance so a person can sustain themselves over a lifetime. Therefore the correct answer is b: To empower individuals for life. Options a and c describe limited or temporary outcomes (immediate food or a specific job), and d (to entertain) is not implied by the proverb.

Question:
In "The Parrot's Tale," what was the initial conclusion of the scholars about the bird's ignorance?

Options:
a. The bird lacked intelligence
b. The cage was too small
c. The bird's nest was unsuitable for knowledge
d. The bird was lazy


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
1. Step 1 — Read the passage: the scholars noticed the parrot's ignorance and looked for an external cause rather than blaming the bird itself.  
2. Step 2 — Interpret their conclusion: they decided the bird’s nest was unsuitable for gaining knowledge, so the environment prevented learning — this matches option c.  
3. Reasoning: the scholars attribute ignorance to an unsuitable nest (environmental cause), not to the bird’s innate mind or behavior.  
4. Why other options are incorrect: option a (lacked intelligence) blames the bird itself, option b (cage too small) is about confinement not mentioned, and option d (lazy) attributes a character flaw not asserted by the scholars.

How does the story illustrate the importance of meaningful education?

Options:
a. By showing how to create a beautiful cage
b. By demonstrating the bird's ability to sing
c. By highlighting the bird's suffering due to neglect
d. By focusing on the King's wealth


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central theme — the question asks how the story illustrates the importance of meaningful education, so look for parts of the story that show consequences of lacking such education.  
Step 2: Match the theme to the options — the story emphasizes the bird's suffering due to neglect as the result of empty, unhelpful instruction, which directly shows why education must be meaningful to prevent harm.  
Step 3: Eliminate incorrect choices — option a (making a beautiful cage) and option d (the King’s wealth) are irrelevant to the value of education, and option b (the bird’s ability to sing) describes an outcome but does not by itself illustrate the importance of meaningful education unless tied to the bird’s suffering.  
Conclusion: therefore option c is correct because the bird’s suffering due to neglect highlights the need for education that truly cares for and benefits the learner.

Question:
Analyze the impact of the King's decisions on the bird's educational outcome. What could he have done differently?

Options:
a. Ignored the bird's condition
b. Focused on the physical appearance of the cage
c. Ensured proper feeding and care alongside education
d. Only consulted scholars without observing the bird


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the core issue: the bird’s poor health and environment reduce its ability to learn; education alone cannot overcome malnutrition or stress.
2. Correct approach: the king should both ensure proper feeding, medical care and a safe environment, and provide instruction—this combination supports learning and retention.
3. Therefore the best choice is (c) Ensured proper feeding and care alongside education because it addresses both physical needs and educational input.
4. Why others are wrong: (a) Ignoring the bird’s condition leaves the cause of poor learning unaddressed; (b) Focusing on the cage’s appearance is superficial and won’t improve the bird’s health or ability to learn; (d) Only consulting scholars without observing or caring for the bird ignores practical needs and real conditions.

Question:
What does the proverb "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed them for a lifetime" imply about education?

Options:
a. Education is only about memorizing facts.
b. Teaching skills is more valuable than one-time assistance.
c. People do not need education if they can fish.
d. Fishing is more important than studying.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish is temporary help (feeds for a day) while teaching to fish gives a lasting ability (feeds for a lifetime).  
Step 2: Match this interpretation to the choices: the proverb emphasizes long-term skill-building rather than one-time aid.  
Step 3: Therefore option b is correct because it states "Teaching skills is more valuable than one-time assistance."  
Also, the other options are incorrect: a is wrong because the proverb rejects mere memorization/short-term fixes; c is wrong because it ignores the value of learning; d is wrong because the proverb uses fishing as a metaphor for learning, not to claim fishing is more important than studying.

Question:
Why did the King want to educate the bird in "The Parrot's Tale"?

Options:
a. To make it perform tricks.
b. To improve its singing abilities.
c. To show off the bird to his guests.
d. To provide knowledge that could benefit the kingdom.


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the king’s motive in the story — he wanted the parrot to gain useful knowledge that could be used for the good of the realm.  
Step 2: Match this intent to the options: option d directly states “to provide knowledge that could benefit the kingdom,” so it fits the king’s purpose.  
Why the others are wrong: options a and b (perform tricks, improve singing) and c (show off to guests) describe entertainment or vanity motives not supported by the text, so they are incorrect.

Question:
In the story, how did the scholars plan to educate the bird?

Options:
a. By giving it a proper cage for comfort.
b. By teaching it to sing better songs.
c. By feeding it knowledge through texts.
d. By taking it on trips to learn about the world.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the key detail in the story — the scholars intended to give the bird instruction via written material or books, i.e., impart knowledge through texts.  
Step 2: Interpret the phrase “educate the bird” literally/metaphorically as giving it learning from books rather than changing its environment or skills like singing.  
Step 3: Choose the option that matches that detail — option c is correct because it states “feeding it knowledge through texts.”  

Explanation of why other options are incorrect:
- a is wrong because a cage for comfort addresses physical containment, not education.  
- b is wrong because teaching to sing focuses on performance, not imparting learned knowledge from texts.  
- d is wrong because taking trips is experiential learning, but the story specifies textual instruction rather than travel.

Question:
What lesson can be learned from the bird's experience in the story?

Options:
a. Knowledge is more important than freedom.
b. Education without care can harm rather than help.
c. All birds should live in cages.
d. Singing is the only form of expression.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the bird’s situation in the story — it was given “education” or training but lacked proper care and freedom, and suffered as a result.  
Step 2: Identify the core lesson: the negative outcome shows that teaching or schooling alone, without attention to welfare and freedom, can be harmful.  
Step 3: Match this inference to the options: option (b) “Education without care can harm rather than help” directly captures that lesson, so (b) is correct.

Why other choices are wrong: (a) is incorrect because the story stresses that freedom and care matter, not that knowledge is more important than freedom; (c) is clearly false and not supported by the story; (d) is too narrow and unrelated to the moral about care and well‑being.

Question:
If you were the teacher in "The Parrot's Tale," how would you approach educating the bird to ensure it thrives?

Options:
a. Focus on teaching it only through books.
b. Incorporate fun activities alongside lessons.
c. Ensure it spends most of its time in the cage.
d. Teach it to compete with other birds.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: To decide, consider what helps a parrot thrive: mental stimulation, social interaction, physical exercise and positive reinforcement. Teaching only from books is one-dimensional and unrealistic for a bird; keeping it mostly in a cage limits movement and social learning; forcing competition can cause stress. Incorporating fun activities alongside lessons provides varied stimulation, motivation, and opportunities for practice, so option b is the best choice.

Question:
What is the primary purpose of education according to the proverb, "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"?

Options:
a. To provide temporary relief
b. To foster self-sufficiency
c. To increase economic wealth
d. To ensure social status


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — "Give a person a fish..." contrasts a one-time aid with "teach a person to fish," which emphasizes providing skills that allow someone to support themselves long-term. 
Step 2: Match this meaning to the options: option b (to foster self-sufficiency) directly captures the idea of teaching skills for lifelong independence; option a describes the one-time help mentioned but not the proverb’s main point; options c and d (increase economic wealth, ensure social status) are unrelated to the proverb’s focus on personal capability. 
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
Why did the King in "The Parrot's Tale" want to educate the bird?

Options:
a. To make it a pet
b. To improve its singing
c. To enhance its usefulness
d. To decorate its cage


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the king’s stated goal in the story — he wanted the bird to serve a practical purpose beyond mere appearance or song.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that goal: making it a pet or decorating its cage (options a and d) are about appearance/companionship, and improving its singing (b) is about entertainment.  
Step 3: Conclude that option c — to enhance its usefulness — matches the king’s intention of training the parrot to be of service or use.  

Explanation of wrong choices: a, b, and d focus on pethood, entertainment, or decoration, which do not capture the king’s aim to make the bird more useful.

Question:
In what way can education be applied in everyday life in rural Bangladesh?

Options:
a. Increasing the number of schools
b. Learning agricultural techniques
c. Studying historical events
d. Memorizing poems


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
1. Step 1 – Identify the context: the question asks which option has direct, everyday applicability for people living in rural Bangladesh (whose livelihoods often rely on farming).
2. Step 2 – Evaluate options by practical impact: learning agricultural techniques gives farmers concrete skills to improve crop yields, pest control, irrigation and income, so it applies directly to daily rural life.
3. Step 3 – Eliminate less relevant choices: increasing the number of schools (a) is a structural/policy change rather than an immediate everyday application; studying historical events (c) and memorizing poems (d) are valuable culturally/educationally but less directly useful for routine rural tasks.
Conclusion: Option b is correct because learning agricultural techniques most directly and practically applies education to everyday life in rural Bangladesh.

Question:
Analyze the role of the goldsmith and the scribes in the story. What does their involvement suggest about society's view on education?

Options:
a. They valued education above all
b. They were only interested in profit
c. They cared for the bird's well-being
d. They believed in collaborative efforts


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify actions: the goldsmith and the scribes in the story demand payment or act with self-interest when approached about the bird’s learning, showing their primary motive is monetary gain.  
2. Reasoning: because they require fees or prioritize their own benefit rather than freely teaching or protecting the bird, their behavior indicates education is treated as a commodity.  
3. Conclusion: this supports option b — they were only interested in profit.  
4. Why others are incorrect: option a is wrong because they do not place education above profit; option c is wrong because they do not show genuine care for the bird’s well‑being; option d is wrong because their actions are not collaborative or community‑oriented.

Question:
How does the story of The Parrot’s Tale illustrate the difference between traditional education and modern educational practices involving technology?

Options:
a. It shows that traditional education relies solely on rote learning.
b. It highlights that modern education focuses only on technology without understanding the learners.
c. It suggests that both traditional and modern education can neglect the actual needs of the learner.
d. It indicates that traditional education is more effective than modern educational practices.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main lesson of "The Parrot’s Tale" — the parrot’s true needs (communication, comfort, real interaction) were ignored even when different teaching methods or tools were applied.  
Step 2: Compare that lesson to the options: the story criticizes approaches that miss the learner’s actual needs rather than endorsing a single method.

Reasoning and conclusion: Option c is correct because the tale shows how both traditional methods (rote teaching or assumptions about learning) and modern technology-driven practices can fail if they do not attend to the learner’s real needs. Option a is incorrect because the story does not claim traditional education is only rote learning; option b is too narrow — modern education is not necessarily only about technology, and the story’s point is broader; option d is incorrect because the story does not show traditional methods to be superior.

What is one significant critique of traditional education as presented in the story?

Options:
a. Efficiency in labor
b. Focus on theoretical knowledge
c. Popularity of teachers
d. It fosters competition


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the story's main critique — it highlights that education values bookish or theoretical knowledge and rote learning rather than practical understanding or useful skills.  
Step 2: Compare this central point with the options: option b matches directly because it states "Focus on theoretical knowledge."  
Step 3: Explain why other options are incorrect: option a (efficiency in labor) is not the story's focus, option c (popularity of teachers) is irrelevant, and option d (it fosters competition) is not presented as the primary criticism.

Question:
What does the 'gilded cage' metaphorically represent?

Options:
a. Wealth and luxury
b. The constraints of society
c. Freedom and exploration
d. Joy in learning


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the metaphor — "gilded" means covered in gold (attractive or luxurious) while "cage" implies confinement or restriction.  
Step 2: Combine meanings — a "gilded cage" therefore describes a situation that looks appealing outwardly but traps or limits the person inside.  
Thus the best choice is option b: the constraints of society. Other options are incorrect because (a) emphasizes only wealth, (c) contradicts the idea of a cage, and (d) is unrelated to the metaphor.

Options:
a. They became respected figures
b. They were ignored by society
c. They profited from the system
d. They were punished for failure


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the outcome described: the story shows the teachers taking advantage of the rules or opportunities to gain money or material benefits from the system.  
Step 2 — Match to options: that outcome corresponds directly to option c, "They profited from the system."  
Step 3 — Why others are wrong: option a ("respected figures") and option b ("ignored by society") contradict the described gain of influence/benefit, and option d ("punished for failure") is opposite to the teachers receiving profit. Therefore the correct answer is c.

Why does the story highlight the relationship between the bird and its owners?

Options:
a. It emphasizes authority
b. It shows mutual respect
c. It reflects dependency
d. It reveals jealousy


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution: The story repeatedly shows that the owners depend on the bird for specific tasks and that the bird relies on the owners for food and shelter, so the central point is their mutual reliance — i.e., dependency. This directly supports option c as the best answer. Options a and d are not emphasized because authority or jealousy are not focal themes, and option b (mutual respect) may be present but is secondary to the clear pattern of dependency.

Question:
What aspect of learning is criticized through the bird's experience?

Options:
a. Emphasis on rote memorization
b. Collaboration among students
c. Creative thinking
d. Diversity in teaching methods


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the criticism in the bird’s experience — the bird is shown learning fixed facts or reciting lessons without understanding or practical application (learning by repetition rather than meaningful understanding).
Step 2: Match that criticism to the choices — this directly corresponds to a “Emphasis on rote memorization.”
Step 3: Eliminate other options briefly — b (collaboration) isn’t criticized because the issue is about method, not peer interaction; c (creative thinking) is the opposite of what’s being suppressed; d (diversity in teaching methods) is not the focus since the complaint targets one narrow, repetitive method. 

Therefore the correct answer is a.

What might the 'sacred tufts of hair' symbolize in the context of education?

Options:
a. A source of wisdom
b. A mark of respect
c. Religious beliefs
d. Tradition and culture


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Consider the phrase "sacred tufts of hair" in an educational context — it most naturally points to practices or symbols passed down over generations rather than a literal source of knowledge.  
Step 2: Compare options: a (a source of wisdom) is unlikely because hair itself does not convey knowledge; b (a mark of respect) could be a secondary meaning but is narrower; c (religious beliefs) is related but too specific.  
Conclusion: d is best — it represents tradition and culture, symbolizing long-standing customs associated with education.

Question:
Who would likely benefit the most from the changes advocated in the story?

Options:
a. Teachers
b. Parents
c. Students
d. Government officials


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the aim of the advocated changes — the story discusses reforms intended to improve learning, classroom experience, or student outcomes.
Step 2: Determine who directly benefits — since the changes are designed to enhance education and learning, the primary beneficiaries are the learners themselves.
Step 3: Conclude the answer — therefore option c (Students) is the best choice.

Why other options are less likely:
- a Teachers: may benefit indirectly (easier teaching), but they are not the main focus.
- b Parents: might see long-term benefits, but the immediate target is students.
- d Government officials: are not the intended beneficiaries; they may implement policy but don’t gain the primary advantage.

Question:
What could be inferred about the community's attitude towards education in the story?

Options:
a. It encourages innovation
b. It values conformity
c. It neglects emotional connection
d. It promotes inclusivity


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify textual cues — the story highlights strict rules, emphasis on following established methods, punishment or disapproval of deviation, and pressure to match others’ performance.  
Step 2: Interpret those cues — such details indicate the community prizes sameness and adherence to rules rather than independent thinking. Therefore the best inference is option b: it values conformity.

Why other options are incorrect:
- a (encourages innovation): contradicts the suppression of deviation and creativity described.  
- c (neglects emotional connection): not clearly supported if the text focuses on rules and performance rather than relationships.  
- d (promotes inclusivity): contradicted by exclusionary or uniform expectations that favor conformity.

Question:
The bird's eventual demise represents which theme in the narrative?

Options:
a. The futility of education
b. The triumph of survival
c. The challenges of adolescence
d. The necessity of adaptation


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what the bird’s death symbolizes in the story — the event follows the bird’s learning or efforts but results in loss rather than improvement.  
Step 2: Reasoning — if the narrative shows that education or learning did not prevent the bird’s demise and the author uses that outcome to critique the value or effectiveness of those efforts, the theme is the futility of education. This aligns directly with option (a).  
Step 3: Reject other choices briefly — (b) “triumph of survival” contradicts the bird’s death; (c) “challenges of adolescence” is unrelated unless the story centers on youth coming of age; (d) “necessity of adaptation” would be supported if the bird survived by adapting, but here it dies, so adaptation is not shown as successful.  

Therefore the correct answer is (a): The futility of education.

Why might the King’s actions be interpreted as misguided?

Options:
a. He prioritized tradition over knowledge
b. He emphasized progress over tradition
c. He neglected the bird's welfare
d. He failed to educate himself


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Determine what "misguided" refers to in the context — actions that are wrong because they harm or ignore what should be cared for.  
Step 2: The King’s actions can be seen as misguided if they directly neglected the bird’s needs or caused it suffering, so option c is the best fit.  
Step 3: Options a and b are incorrect because they assert a priority (tradition over knowledge or progress over tradition) not shown by the premise, and option d is less direct — failing to educate himself might explain poor decisions but does not specifically identify neglect of the bird’s welfare.

In terms of societal critique, what does the story suggest about group dynamics?

Options:
a. They are inherently supportive
b. They can lead to oppression
c. They promote forward-thinking
d. They value individual opinions


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the theme: the question asks about the story’s societal critique regarding how groups behave and affect individuals.
2. Reasoning: the story depicts conformity, suppression of dissent, and power being exercised by the majority or leaders—this shows group dynamics can become coercive and oppressive.
3. Elimination: options (a) and (d) claim groups are inherently supportive or value individual opinions, which contradicts the story’s examples of silencing and marginalization; (c) (promote forward-thinking) is not the central critique shown.
Therefore the correct answer is b: they can lead to oppression.

Question:
The ultimately damaging aspects of the bird’s education represent a broader critique of which educational approach?

Options:
a. Holistic learning
b. Standardized testing
c. Experiential learning
d. Formal education structures


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution: The passage’s criticism targets the rigid, institutionalized system that teaches the bird to conform, suppresses its natural instincts, and enforces rules that ultimately harm it. That pattern is a critique of formal education structures rather than a praise of balanced or hands‑on methods. Options a (holistic learning) and c (experiential learning) emphasize broad or practical development and would not typically be described as “ultimately damaging,” while b (standardized testing) is narrower—focused on assessment rather than the whole institutional framework. Therefore the correct answer is d: Formal education structures.

Question:
How does the narrative reflect on the theme of individual versus institutional power?

Options:
a. Institutions are always right
b. Individuals often triumph
c. Power dynamics are complex
d. All power is corrupt


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central conflict — the story sets individual characters against institutional forces (laws, bureaucracy, social systems).  
Step 2: Examine outcomes and tone — the narrative gives varied results: sometimes individuals win, sometimes institutions enforce rules, and often compromises or ambiguities remain.  
Step 3: Infer theme — because the outcomes are mixed and the story highlights shifting balances rather than a single rule, the theme is that power dynamics are complex. Therefore the correct answer is c.

Why other options are incorrect: a is false because the narrative shows institutions can be challenged or fail; b is too absolute since individuals do not always triumph; d is too sweeping and cynical—power is shown as problematic at times but not uniformly corrupt.

Question:
What emotional response might the readers experience as a result of the bird's fate?

Options:
a. Joy
b. Indifference
c. Sadness
d. Confusion


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the emotional tone of the bird's fate — if the fate is tragic, harmful, or evokes loss, the tone is negative and evokes empathy.  
Step 2: Empathy and sympathy in readers typically produce sorrow or mourning, so the most natural response to a sad or tragic outcome is sadness.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is c: Sadness. Options a (Joy) and b (Indifference) contradict the negative/empathic tone, and d (Confusion) describes a cognitive state rather than the emotional reaction suggested.

Question:
Which metaphor is explored through the cage's representation?

Options:
a. Knowledge as a boundary
b. Success as a cage
c. Failure as a result of education
d. Freedom through learning


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what a cage commonly symbolizes — restriction, limit, or barrier that prevents movement or growth.  
Step 2: Relate that to "knowledge as a boundary": if the cage represents how certain kinds of knowledge or received ideas confine thinking, then the metaphor is of knowledge creating limits.  
Step 3: Compare options: option (a) matches this reading. Options (b) and (c) misread the symbol (they focus on success or failure rather than the limiting aspect), and (d) is the opposite meaning (cage implying restriction, not freedom).  
Therefore the correct answer is (a).

Question:
What do the teachers' actions cause in relation to the bird's potential?

Options:
a. Increased growth
b. Stunted development
c. Emotional connection
d. Cognitive flexibility


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the effect described — the teachers' actions limit the bird's opportunities (for movement, learning or practice).  
Step 2: Reasoning — when external agents restrict experience or growth, the natural outcome is reduced physical or developmental progress, i.e., stunted development.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices — (a) Increased growth contradicts the idea of restriction; (c) Emotional connection refers to feelings, not developmental capacity; (d) Cognitive flexibility implies enhanced mental adaptability, which would not result from limiting actions.  
Conclusion: therefore the correct answer is option (b) Stunted development.

Question:
The societal values can be inferred to prioritize which over animal welfare?

Options:
a. Economic gain
b. Artistic merit
c. Community support
d. Cultural tradition


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the key phrase — “prioritize ... over animal welfare” implies choices that place human benefits or material returns above concern for animals.  
Step 2: Match options to that idea — a Economic gain directly represents material/financial benefit that is often put ahead of animal welfare.  
Step 3: Eliminate others — b Artistic merit, c Community support, and d Cultural tradition may influence decisions but do not as clearly express prioritizing tangible human economic interests.  
Therefore the correct answer is a Economic gain.

Question:
What lesson about patience is illustrated in the King’s oversight?

Options:
a. It is always justified
b. It is often overlooked
c. It leads to success
d. It must be taught


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The king’s oversight means he failed to notice or appreciate patience, so the lesson is about patience being neglected rather than praised. Comparing options shows that (a) “always justified” and (c) “leads to success” make unwarranted positive claims, and (d) “must be taught” is not implied by mere oversight. The best match is (b) it is often overlooked, because “oversight” directly indicates something being missed or ignored. Hence the correct answer is b.

Question:
How might the King's view of education be considered retrogressive?

Options:
a. It inspired creativity
b. It overlooked emotional needs
c. It was open-minded
d. It valued individual differences


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: 
Step 1 — Interpret "retrogressive": it means moving backward or resisting progress in education.  
Step 2 — The King's view can be seen as retrogressive because it b overlooked students' emotional and holistic needs, which modern progressive education considers essential.  
Step 3 — The other choices are progressive qualities: a inspiring creativity, c being open-minded, and d valuing individual differences all support educational progress, so they cannot be the retrogressive characteristic.

Question:
Which of these models of education does the story criticize?

Options:
a. Student-centered learning
b. Behavioral learning
c. Teacher-directed methods
d. Experiential education


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the story's main critique — it shows how the teacher controls every activity, students are passive, and creativity or independent thinking is suppressed.  
Step 2: Match that critique to the models listed: a, b, and d emphasize student agency, observable behaviors, or learning by experience, while c corresponds to a teacher-centered, controlling approach.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is option c (Teacher-directed methods).  

Explanation of why other options are incorrect:  
- a Student-centered learning promotes active, autonomous learners, which the story criticizes the opposite of.  
- b Behavioral learning focuses on reinforcement and observable responses, not necessarily the authoritarian control highlighted.  
- d Experiential education values hands-on, reflective learning, unlike the restrictive teacher-directed model shown in the story.

Question:
How does the narrative depict the educators' motivations?

Options:
a. To elevate society
b. To gain financial rewards
c. To avoid confrontation
d. To maintain authority


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify textual cues — the narrative repeatedly emphasizes the educators' insistence on rules, control of classroom behavior, and efforts to preserve institutional traditions, which point to a motivation centered on holding power and authority.  
Step 2: Compare options — (a) "To elevate society" would be supported by explicit altruistic aims or reformist language, which the text lacks; (b) "To gain financial rewards" would appear as concern for pay or material benefit, not present; (c) "To avoid confrontation" would show passivity, whereas the educators act proactively to enforce norms.  
Step 3: Conclude — the best fit is (d) "To maintain authority," because the narrative’s emphasis on control and preservation of status clearly matches that motivation.

Question:
What underlying message about individuality can be derived from the bird’s plight?

Options:
a. Individuality thrives in structure
b. Conformity can be detrimental
c. Collective identity is paramount
d. Self-expression is always valued


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the bird’s plight as a conflict between the bird’s natural traits and external pressure to fit in. This frames the theme around tension between individuality and conformity.  
Step 2: Infer the underlying message: when a character (the bird) suffers because it cannot—or is not allowed to—express its true nature, the text warns that forcing sameness harms uniqueness and well‑being.  
Step 3: Choose the option that matches this inference: option b (Conformity can be detrimental).

Why the other options are incorrect:
- Option a (Individuality thrives in structure): contradicts the plight, which shows individuality being suppressed rather than supported by structure.  
- Option c (Collective identity is paramount): implies the story praises losing individuality for the group, which the bird’s suffering does not endorse.  
- Option d (Self-expression is always valued): overstates the case; the bird’s experience shows self-expression is discouraged or punished, not universally valued.

What insight about the nature of human relationships is implied in the moral of the story?

Options:
a. They are inherently nurturing
b. They can be damaging
c. They improve life experience
d. They flourish without intervention


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the moral: the story’s outcome shows characters being hurt or harmed by their relationships, so the implied insight is that relationships can cause damage—this matches option b.
2. Reasoning: the plot details (conflict, betrayal, or negative consequences) indicate harm rather than care or automatic growth, so the moral warns about damaging effects.
3. Eliminate other choices: option a (“inherently nurturing”) and option c (“they improve life experience”) contradict the negative outcome shown; option d (“they flourish without intervention”) is unsupported because the story highlights problems, not effortless growth.
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Options:

b. Indecision can be harmful
c. Strictness ensures loyalty
d. Popularity leads to progress


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the central behavior: the King repeatedly hesitates or avoids making firm decisions, causing confusion and negative outcomes.
2. Reasoning: indecision leads to delays, loss of authority and missed opportunities, so the narrative shows that a leader's inability to decide can be harmful.
3. Eliminate other options: compassion overriding authority (a) is not emphasized as the main trait; strictness ensures loyalty (c) is contradicted by the King’s weak resolve; popularity leads to progress (d) is not supported by the portrayed consequences.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the dominant theme: examine how characters, events, and outcomes relate to society’s expectations.  
Step 2 — Match evidence to options: the story emphasizes characters clinging to traditions, social pressure to conform, and obstacles to new ideas — this aligns with resistance to change.  
Step 3 — Eliminate other choices: it does not portray an embrace of individual freedom (so not a), nor does it dramatize active rebellion (not c), and it focuses on communal norms rather than celebrating individualism (not d).  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
What might the failure of the bird symbolize in a broader context?

Options:
a. The cost of independence
b. The dangers of ignorance
c. The power of collaboration
d. The success of tradition


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the theme — the bird’s failure points to a lack (of knowledge, awareness, or preparation) rather than a deliberate sacrifice or communal outcome.  
Step 2: Reasoning — in a broader context that lack leads to mistakes and harm, so the failure most naturally symbolizes the dangers of ignorance (answer: b).  
Step 3: Eliminate others — a (the cost of independence) implies a chosen sacrifice for freedom, c (the power of collaboration) implies success through working together, and d (the success of tradition) implies positive continuity; none of these match a story focused on failure due to lack of knowledge.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the story we note the classroom is described as focused on reciting facts, repeating lessons, and valuing memorized answers over understanding — language that signals an old-fashioned approach.  
Step 2: That description matches "rote memorization," so the correct choice is (b).  
Step 3: The other options are modern, interactive approaches (hands-on learning, group discussions, creative expression) and are not depicted as outdated in the story, so they are incorrect.

How does the structure of society affect the themes in 'The Parrot's Tale'?

Options:
a. It encourages progressive thought
b. It rigidly enforces tradition
c. It supports innovation
d. It promotes free expression


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the link between societal structure and themes — examine how characters, conflicts, and plot reflect social norms and power relations.  
Step 2: In "The Parrot's Tale" the narrative emphasizes strict social hierarchies, enforced customs, and resistance to change, so the themes center on constraint, conformity, and preservation of tradition.  
Step 3: Therefore option b (it rigidly enforces tradition) is correct because the story’s conflicts and character responses consistently illustrate enforcement of traditional values.  
Step 4: Other options are incorrect: a and c (progressive thought, supports innovation) contradict the story’s emphasis on resistance to change, and d (promotes free expression) is false because characters are often silenced or constrained by social rules.

Step 2: The parrot’s learning is portrayed as a pursuit of wisdom and true knowledge, not a means to earn money, social rank, or fame.

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the story and locate the lines describing the bird’s behavior and abilities; it was described as lacking knowledge/skills or unable to follow learned tasks, which indicates it was uneducated.

Options:

b. Through verbal communication
c. By singing to it
d. Using physical training


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
The scholars chose to educate the bird by building a cage because a cage provides a controlled environment that restricts the bird’s movement and makes it easier to train and observe. Step 1: identify the method described — constructing a cage physically confines the bird. Step 2: eliminate alternatives — mere verbal communication or singing (options b and c) would not reliably control or contain the bird, and physical training (option d) implies handling or conditioning but does not by itself create the secure environment a cage does. Therefore the correct choice is option a.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the story’s emphasis — the cage is repeatedly shown as the place where characters gain facts, learn truths, or access information, so its role is tied to acquiring knowledge.  
Step 2: Match that emphasis to the options: "essential for knowledge" directly corresponds to the cage being necessary for learning or understanding in the narrative, so b is correct.  
Step 3: Eliminate others: a (a distraction) and d (merely decorative) contradict the cage’s active, knowledge-related role, and c (societal norms) misreads a symbolic object as a social institution rather than a source of information.

2. Match to options: option b ("He cared about the bird's well-being") directly corresponds to concern for education and welfare, so it fits best.
3. Why others are wrong: a (perform shows) implies a utilitarian motive not stated; c (frustrated by expenses) refers to cost, not concern for education; d (sought advice from the scholars) describes an action, not the reason. Hence the correct answer is b.

Solution:

Step 1: From the passage we infer the taught behaviors prevented the bird from learning practical survival skills (it became dependent, could not find food or avoid danger).  
Step 2: That consequence matches option c — it became unable to survive. Options a (became independent) and d (flourished) contradict the described dependence and decline; option b (learned to sing beautifully) might be true but is not the ultimate harmful result.

Options:
a. They ignored its health
b. They focused on maintenance

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify textual evidence — the characters spend time arranging the bird’s cage, polishing its appearance, and praising how it looks while failing to attend to its illness or basic needs.  
Step 2: Infer priority — those actions show they value outward appearance more than the bird’s welfare, so their behavior is one of valuing appearance over substance.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices — a is incorrect because they did not actively care for its health; b is wrong because “maintenance” would imply proper care rather than mere decoration; d is irrelevant to the described behavior.  

Therefore the correct answer is c.

What lesson can be learned about education from this tale?

Options:
a. Education must be enforced
b. Mere knowledge is not enough
c. Cages limit knowledge
d. Education is inherently valuable


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the tale’s central point — it shows a character with information or training that fails because it isn’t understood, applied, or combined with wisdom.  
Step 2: Compare this with the options: option b (“Mere knowledge is not enough”) matches directly because the tale emphasizes that knowledge alone, without understanding or proper use, fails.  
Step 3: Eliminate others briefly — option a (education must be enforced) is about compulsion, which the tale does not stress; option c (cages limit knowledge) is a literal/metaphorical reading but not the main moral; option d (education is inherently valuable) is too general and contradicts the tale’s warning that knowledge without application can be useless.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

How does the story of 'The Parrot’s Tale' reflect the theme of education compared to modern educational practices discussed in the article on education and technology?

Options:
a. Both emphasize rote learning without practical application.
b. The story critiques traditional education methods, while the article praises AI for personalized learning.
c. Both the story and the article advocate for the complete removal of teachers.
d. The story shows that education is solely about acquiring knowledge, similar to AI's automatic grading.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central theme of the parrot’s tale — it criticizes traditional, rote-focused education and highlights the need for meaningful, context-rich learning.  
Step 2: Identify the article’s stance — it praises modern tools like AI for enabling personalized, adaptive learning rather than one-size-fits-all rote methods.  
Step 3: Match themes to options: b correctly contrasts the story’s critique of traditional methods with the article’s praise for personalized AI-driven learning, so it is correct.

Why the other options are wrong:
- a is false because the article does not emphasize rote learning; it emphasizes personalization.  
- c is false because neither text advocates completely removing teachers.

Question:
In 'The Parrot’s Tale', what ultimately leads to the demise of the bird, and how does this compare to potential drawbacks of AI in education as discussed in the second source?

Options:
a. The bird was overfed, similar to how AI tools can overwhelm students with information.
b. The bird was isolated and neglected, akin to AI's lack of emotional support for students.
c. The bird learned too quickly, just like AI is always correct.
d. The bird was given too much freedom, reflecting AI's focus on independent study.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From "The Parrot’s Tale" the bird’s demise is attributed to isolation and neglect—it withers because it lacks care and companionship.  
Step 2: The second source’s discussion of AI in education highlights a similar drawback: AI can’t provide genuine emotional support or human care, leading to students feeling isolated despite technological aid.  
Step 3: Therefore the option that best matches both the story and the AI concern is b.  

Why the others are incorrect:  
a is wrong because the story does not describe overfeeding; c is wrong because the bird did not die from learning too quickly and AI is not always correct; d is wrong because excessive freedom isn’t given as the cause in the tale nor is it the primary parallel with AI’s emotional limitations.

Question:
What role do EdTech companies play in the implementation of AI in education, and how does this compare to the role of the King in 'The Parrot’s Tale'?

Options:
a. Both provide financial resources to educational systems.
b. Both are criticized for their lack of understanding of educational needs.
c. Both focus solely on the infrastructure instead of the students' learning.
d. Both ensure that education is accessible to everyone.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the primary behaviours: EdTech companies implementing AI often concentrate on building platforms, data systems, and technical infrastructure (tools, deployment, scalability) rather than directly redesigning pedagogy or centring individual learners’ needs.  
Step 2 — Relate to the King in "The Parrot’s Tale": the King similarly emphasizes institutions, appearances, or control (infrastructure of power) rather than focusing on the subjects’ real learning or welfare.  
Step 3 — Match to options: this parallel is exactly what option c states, so option c is correct.  
Why the other options are wrong: option a is incorrect because neither is primarily a financier; option b is too general — while critics may say EdTech or the King misunderstand needs, the question compares their focus, not their competence; option d is incorrect because neither necessarily ensures universal accessibility to education.

Question:
How does Totto-chan's experience at her new school illustrate the importance of personalized education, similar to the advantages of AI mentioned in the article?

Options:
a. Both highlight the importance of strict discipline in learning.
b. Both show that children thrive when they are listened to and encouraged.
c. Both advocate for standardized tests to measure success.
d. Both suggest that education can happen without teachers.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the common theme—Totto-chan’s new school emphasizes individualized attention, listening to each child, and encouraging their natural curiosity.  
Step 2: Note how Totto-chan thrives because teachers adapt to her needs and encourage her, which is the core idea of personalized education.  
Step 3: Compare with the article’s advantages of AI—AI can provide personalized feedback, adapt to each learner, and support students in ways that mirror being listened to and encouraged.  
Conclusion: Therefore option b is correct.  

Why the others are wrong: a is false because both examples value responsiveness, not strict discipline; c is wrong because standardized tests conflict with personalization; d is incorrect because neither Totto-chan’s story nor responsible uses of AI claim teachers are unnecessary—both focus on better support, not replacement.

Options:
a. Both suggest that passive observation is sufficient for learning.
b. Both stress that involvement leads to improvement in personal and communal life.
c. Both indicate that authority figures alone are responsible for community well-being.
d. Both highlight the importance of financial contributions over actual involvement.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ 1: লক্ষ্য করুন যে "The Parrot's Tale" এ তোতাটি সক্রিয়ভাবে শেখে ও সমাজে অংশ নিয়ে পরিবর্তন আনে, এবং নাগরিক অংশগ্রহণের ধারণাও সমাজ উন্নয়নে সক্রিয় অংশগ্রহণকে গুরুত্ব দেয় — তাই দুটোই অংশগ্রহণের প্রয়োজনীয়তা তুলে ধরে।  
ধাপ 2: বিকল্পগুলো বিশ্লেষণ করে দেখা যায়, a ভুল কারণ উভয় প্রাসঙ্গিক কাহিনী ও ধারণা শুধু নিরব পর্যবেক্ষণকেই যথেষ্ট বলে না; c ভুল কারণ এটি দায়িত্ব একমাত্র কর্তৃপক্ষের ওপর আরোপ করে যা উভয়ের বক্তব্যের সাথে সাংগত নয়; d ভুল কারণ উভয় ক্ষেত্রেই বৈশিষ্ট্যগতভাবে বাস্তব অংশগ্রহণ ও সক্রিয়তা আর্থিক দানকে ছাড়িয়ে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ।  
ধাপ 3: তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো b — উভয়ই ব্যক্তিগত ও সামাজিক জীবনের উন্নতির জন্য সক্রিয় অংশগ্রহণকে গুরুত্ব দেয়।

Question:
What common theme is shared between the educational experiences described in 'The Parrot's Tale' and those of Alex in the volunteer story?

Options:
a. Both emphasize the significance of financial assistance in education.
b. Both illustrate that true learning occurs through practical experience and community involvement.
c. Both suggest that learning is best achieved in isolation from others.
d. Both indicate that education should focus solely on theoretical knowledge.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the core message in "The Parrot's Tale" — it highlights learning through hands-on experience and involvement with others.  
Step 2: Identify Alex’s experience — Alex learns by volunteering, gaining practical skills and community engagement rather than only classroom theory.  
Step 3: Compare both and conclude they share the same theme of experiential, community-based learning, so the correct choice is b.  
Briefly why others are wrong: a focuses on financial aid which isn’t the main theme; c contradicts both stories’ emphasis on community; d ignores the practical, experiential aspects both narratives stress.

Question:
How does the outcome of the bird's education in 'The Parrot's Tale' serve as a warning regarding the implementation of AI in education as described in the article?

Options:
a. It suggests that education without practical application can be harmful.
b. It shows that AI can replace teachers entirely.
c. It indicates that all education should be conducted without any rules.
d. It highlights the need for advanced technology in every classroom.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the tale’s outcome — the parrot acquired rote knowledge but lacked practical wisdom and suffered as a result.  
Step 2: Map that to AI in education — if AI delivers only decontextualized facts without teaching application, critical thinking, or ethical judgment, learners can be ill-prepared; this is a warning that matches option (a).  
Step 3: Reject other choices briefly — (b) is wrong because the story warns about poor forms of education, not that AI will fully replace teachers; (c) is wrong because the tale does not advocate rulelessness; (d) is wrong because it criticizes misplaced reliance on content delivery, not a call for more technology everywhere.

Question:
What is the primary method of civic engagement discussed in the article that differs from the traditional education system depicted in 'The Parrot's Tale'?

Options:
a. Civic engagement is spontaneous and community-focused, unlike the structured approach to education in the story.
b. Civic engagement only involves financial contributions, similar to the King's approach.
c. Civic engagement emphasizes rote memorization similar to AI tools.
d. Civic engagement requires approval from authority figures, as seen in the parrot's schooling.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the education model in "The Parrot's Tale" — it is portrayed as a structured, top-down, formal system where learning is prescribed and controlled by authorities.  
Step 2: Identify the civic engagement described in the article — it is portrayed as spontaneous, grassroots, and community-focused, arising from ordinary people rather than formal institutions.  
Step 3: Compare and conclude — the article's civic engagement contrasts with the story's structured schooling, so option (a) best matches.

Why other options are incorrect:
- Option (b) is wrong because the article describes active participation, not merely financial contributions.  
- Option (c) is wrong because civic engagement in the article is not about rote memorization.  
- Option (d) is wrong because the article emphasizes community initiative rather than requiring authority approval.

Question:
How does the success of Alex's project reflect the potential benefits of incorporating technology in education, similar to the educational insights from 'The Parrot’s Tale'?

Options:
a. Both emphasize the need for community support in educational initiatives.
b. Both highlight that success relies on individual efforts without collaboration.
c. Both show that technology can replace traditional methods entirely.
d. Both indicate that projects should only focus on financial outcomes.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the shared theme — both Alex’s project and "The Parrot’s Tale" show how technology, when combined with local involvement, can improve learning outcomes by increasing access, engagement, and tailored support.  
Step 2: Explain how Alex’s success reflects that theme — his project likely succeeded because teachers, students, and the community supported the technological approach (training, participation, feedback), mirroring the story’s emphasis on community-backed educational innovation.  
Step 3: Conclude the correct option — this matches option a, which stresses the need for community support.  
Why the other options are incorrect: b is wrong because both examples emphasize collaboration, not lone effort; c is incorrect because neither claims technology fully replaces traditional methods—it complements them; d is wrong because the focus is educational impact, not solely financial outcomes.

Question:
How do the outcomes for both the bird in 'The Parrot’s Tale' and the students using AI tools reflect on the broader implications of education?

Options:
a. Both showcase the importance of failing to learn and grow.
b. Both illustrate the dangers of neglecting emotional and practical aspects of education.
c. Both suggest that education should be completely self-driven.
d. Both emphasize that education only matters if it is recognized by authorities.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Compare outcomes: both the parrot and the students experience losses beyond mere academic failure — the parrot suffers emotional/practical neglect (can't live fully), and students using AI miss emotional engagement, practical skills and deeper learning.  
Step 2 — Match to options: this shared theme — neglecting emotional and practical aspects of education — directly corresponds to option b.  
Step 3 — Eliminate others: option a is wrong because the examples emphasize harm from neglect, not the value of failing; option c is wrong because neither story argues for wholly self-driven education; option d is wrong because the point is about real learning and wellbeing, not external recognition.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Options:
a. স্রেফ চাকরি পাওয়ার মাধ্যম হিসেবে
b. শুধুমাত্র একাডেমিক সাফল্য অর্জনের জন্য
c. মহলি ও বৈষম্যের বিরুদ্ধে প্রতিরোধে সাহায্য করে
d. শুধুমাত্র গণনা ও মূল্যের জন্য


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. শিক্ষা সামাজিক উন্নতির জন্য কী করে কাজ করে তা বুঝতে হলে প্রথমে লক্ষ্য করতে হবে যে শিক্ষা জ্ঞানে প্রবেশ, দক্ষতা অর্জন এবং সচেতনতা বৃদ্ধির মাধ্যমে ব্যক্তিকে স্বাধীন ও ক্ষমতায়িত করে।  
2. এর ফলে বৈষম্য কমে, নারীর ক্ষমতায়ন বাড়ে, নাগরিক সচেতনতা ও সামাজিক সদিচ্ছা বৃদ্ধি পায় — এগুলো সামাজিক উন্নয়নের মূল উপাদান; তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল গ (c)।  
3. অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো কেন ভুল: ক (a) শুধু চাকরি পাওয়ার মাধ্যম হিসেবে দেখলে শিক্ষার সামাজিক ও নৈতিক ভূমিকা উপেক্ষিত হয়; খ (b) কেবল একাডেমিক সফলতাই নয় — নৈতিক, সামাজিক ও বৈচিত্র্য স্বীকৃতিও গুরুত্বপূর্ণ; ঘ (d) গণনা ও মূল্য শেখানো অতি সঙ্কীর্ণ ধারণা, সামাজিক উন্নতির ব্যাপক প্রভাব বিবেচনা করে অযথা সীমাবদ্ধ।

Question:
What does the proverb "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime" mean?

Options:
a. Education is less important than food.
b. Teaching someone a skill is more beneficial than providing temporary assistance.
c. People only need to eat fish.
d. Fish are the best source of food.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a person a fish provides short-term relief, while teaching someone to fish gives them a lasting skill and self-sufficiency.  
Step 2: Match this meaning to the choices: b ("Teaching someone a skill is more beneficial than providing temporary assistance") exactly captures the intended lesson, so it's correct.  
Step 3: Why the others are wrong: a contradicts the proverb, and c and d take the words literally about fish rather than the intended metaphor about help versus empowerment.

Options:
a. The King
b. The royal scholars
c. The goldsmith
d. The commoners


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the passage—when the parrot needed to be educated, the task was given to the learned men of the court.  
Step 2: That description matches "the royal scholars," so the correct choice is (b).  
Explanation: The King issued or approved the decision but did not teach the bird himself; the goldsmith and commoners were neither appointed nor described as responsible, so (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.

Question:
Why did the goldsmith create an exquisite cage for the bird?

Options:
a. To make it a comfortable home.
b. Because he wanted to impress the King.
c. He believed the cage was a symbol of education.
d. To keep the bird from escaping.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and note the key word "exquisite" — that suggests the cage was made for its symbolic or aesthetic value rather than merely practical use.  
Step 2: Compare options: making something "exquisite" is less consistent with a purely practical motive (comfortable home or preventing escape) or simply trying to impress the King. It fits best with a symbolic purpose.  
Step 3: Conclude that the goldsmith created the ornate cage because he viewed it as a symbol of education, so the correct answer is c.  
Why others are wrong: options a and d imply practical motives (comfort or confinement) which wouldn't require an "exquisite" design, and option b (to impress the King) is plausible but less directly indicated by the word "exquisite" than the symbolic interpretation in c.

Question:
Which of the following best compares the benefits of traditional education to modern technology in learning?

Options:
a. Traditional education is more effective in all aspects.
b. Modern technology is only beneficial for wealthy students.
c. Both offer unique advantages that can complement each other.
d. Education is not affected by technology.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the core comparison — list strengths of each: traditional education gives structured curricula, face-to-face mentoring, and social development; modern technology offers wider access, personalized learning, and interactive resources.  
Step 2: Assess how they interact — these strengths are complementary: technology can enhance traditional methods (e.g., online resources supplement classroom teaching) while classrooms provide context and mentorship that technology alone may lack.  
Step 3: Choose the best option — therefore option c is correct because it acknowledges that both offer unique advantages that can work together.  
Why the others are incorrect: a is too absolute (traditional is not universally superior), b is misleading (technology can also be low-cost and broadly accessible), and d is false (technology clearly influences how education is delivered and experienced).

Step 2: বিশ্লেষণ — এটি আক্ষরিকভাবে না হলোও মূলত শেখানোর মাধ্যমে স্থায়ী সক্ষমতা ও স্বাধীনতার কথা বলে; অর্থাৎ শিক্ষা বা দক্ষতা দেওয়ার ফলে দীর্ঘমেয়াদী সুবিধা মেলে।  
Step 3: সিদ্ধান্ত — তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল (b) Education provides long-lasting benefits.  

অল্পকথায় অন্য অপশনগুলোর ভুল: (a) বলছে জ্ঞান কেবল অস্থায়ী টেকসইতার জন্য, যা প্রবাদটির সম্পূর্ণ বার্তা নয়; (c) প্রবাদে শারীরিক শক্তির কোনো তুলনা নেই; (d) যদিও শেখানো গুরুত্বপূর্ণ, মূল বার্তা হলো শিক্ষা/দক্ষতা দেওয়ার ফলে দীর্ঘস্থায়ী ফলাফল পাওয়া — তাই (b) সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত।

Question:
In "The Parrot's Tale," what was the initial solution proposed by the scholars to educate the bird?

Options:
a. Teach it to sing better.
b. Construct a proper cage for it.
c. Provide it with more food.
d. Train it to live in the wild.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the scholars' first proposal — they suggested constructing a proper cage for the parrot.  
Step 2: Reasoning — a proper cage was intended to provide a controlled, safe environment where the bird could be kept near teachers and prevented from harmful influences, which they believed would make education easier.  
Why the other options are incorrect: option (a) teaching it to sing better is a specific skill, not the broad initial plan; option (c) providing more food addresses physical needs but not education; option (d) training it to live in the wild contradicts the idea of domestic education and was not the initial proposal.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
প্রশ্নে বলা হয়েছে রাজা কেবল বিদ্যা বা শাস্ত্র পাঠ জানা প্রাণীগুলিকে মূল্যবান মনে করতেন, তাই অশিক্ষিত পাখিটিকে তিনি প্রথমে অনবশ্যক মনে করলেন কারণ তা শাস্ত্র উচ্চারণ করতে পারছিল না — যা সরাসরি b (It could not recite scriptures) অপশনের সঙ্গে মিলে যায়। অন্য অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ: (a) রূপ-স্বর্গীয়তা ছিল প্রধান কারণ না বলে প্রমাণিত হয়নি, (c) উড়তে অক্ষম ছিল এই তথ্যটি কাহিনীতে উল্লেখিত হয়নি, এবং (d) গাইতে ভালো না হওয়া মূল কারণ ছিল না — মূল কারণ ছিল শাস্ত্র জ্ঞান না থাকা।

Question:
If the bird in the story were to represent a student in real life, what could be a potential consequence of focusing only on superficial education?

Options:
a. The student excels academically.
b. The student becomes well-rounded.
c. The student may become disinterested and unmotivated.
d. The student learns practical skills for life.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the metaphor — the bird stands for a student, and “focusing only on superficial education” means concentrating on rote facts, appearances, or short-term rewards rather than deep understanding or intrinsic interest.  
Step 2: Reasoning — superficial learning often fails to engage curiosity, critical thinking, or long-term goals, so the student may lose motivation, become bored, or feel that school is meaningless.  
Step 3: Conclusion — this reasoning matches option c: the student may become disinterested and unmotivated.  
Why the others are incorrect: a is unlikely because superficial study rarely leads to true academic excellence long-term; b contradicts the premise since well-roundedness requires depth and variety; d is wrong because practical life skills typically come from applied, meaningful learning, not just surface-level instruction.

b. By integrating practical life skills into the curriculum.
c. By reducing the number of teachers.
d. By eliminating homework assignments.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. ধাপে ধাপে বিশ্লেষণ: "The Parrot's Tale" থেকে মূল শিক্ষা হলো বাস্তবজ্ঞান, নৈতিকতা ও জীবনমুখী দক্ষতা শেখানো — অর্থাৎ কেবল তাত্ত্বিক জ্ঞান নয় বরং বাস্তব প্রয়োগ যোগ করা।  
2. প্রয়োগপন্থা: স্থানীয় স্কুলে পাঠ্যকাজে প্রকল্পভিত্তিক শিখন, জীবনদক্ষতা (যোগাযোগ, সমস্যা সমাধান, কৃষি/H ঋতু উপযোগী কাজ), এবং সম্প্রদায়ভিত্তিক কার্যক্রম যোগ করলে শিক্ষার্থীর শেখার গুণগত মান বাড়ে।  
3. বিকল্প যাচাই: এই কারণে বিকল্প b (By integrating practical life skills into the curriculum) সঠিক। বিকল্প a তাত্ত্বিক জোর দিলে বাস্তব প্রয়োগ ভুলে যাবে; বিকল্প c শিক্ষক সংকুচিত করলে শিক্ষার মান নেমে যাবে; বিকল্প d সম্পূর্ণ হোমওয়ার বলপূর্বক অনুশীলন বাদ দিলে দক্ষতা অর্জনে বাধা তৈরি হয়।

c. He views education as a means to show off.
d. He does not value education at all.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: গল্পে রাজা যেভাবে পাখিটিকে শিখাচ্ছেন—শিক্ষক ব্যবস্থা করা, শেখার সুযোগ দেওয়া এবং জিজ্ঞাসা-পরীক্ষার মাধ্যমে জ্ঞান যাচাই করা—তাতে স্পষ্ট যে তিনি শিক্ষাকে গুরুত্ব দেন।  
ধাপ ২: এসব কার্যকলাপ থেকে বোঝা যায় তিনি শিক্ষা কে কেবল অভিজাতদের জন্য নয়, বরং প্রয়োজনীয় ও মূল্যবান জিনিস হিসেবে সবাইকে দিতে চান। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো (a) He believes education is essential for everyone.

b. আর্থিক সাফল্য
c. সামাজিক সেবা
d. বিভিন্ন চাকরি পাওয়া


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নে “শিক্ষার চূড়ান্ত লক্ষ্য” বলতে বোঝানো হচ্ছে শিক্ষা শেষে যে সর্বোচ্চ অর্জন আশা করা হয়—মানসিক, নৈতিক ও বৌদ্ধিক বিকাশ।  
ধাপ ২: বিকল্পগুলোর তুলনা করে দেখা যাক: (a) মানসিক উন্নতি শিক্ষার সারমর্ম—চিন্তাশীল হওয়া, জ্ঞান ও মূল্যবোধ বৃদ্ধি; অন্য বিকল্পগুলি (b) আর্থিক সাফল্য, (c) সামাজিক সেবা, (d) বিভিন্ন চাকরি পাওয়া—এগুলো শিক্ষা থেকে প্রাপ্ত সম্ভাব্য ফলাফল বা উদ্দেশ্য হতে পারে, কিন্তু চূড়ান্ত লক্ষ্য হিসেবে মানসিক উন্নতিই সবচেয়ে মৌলিক ও সর্বজনীন।

b. না, কিছুই শেখেনি
c. অংশত সফল ছিল
d. শিক্ষা ছিল অসম্পূর্ণ


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে কাহিনীর বিবরণ থেকে পরীক্ষণ করা হলো যে প্যারোট কোন নতুন শব্দ বা আচরণ স্থায়ীভাবে আয়ত্ত করতে পারেনি এবং শিক্ষক/প্রশিক্ষকের প্রচেষ্টা ফলপ্রসূ হয়নি। তারপর সেটি সংক্ষেপে মূল্যায়ন করে দেখা যায় যে শেখার কোনো নিদর্শন পাওয়া যায়নি, তাই সোজা সিদ্ধান্ত হলো যে প্যারোট কিছুই শেখেনি। অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হল b। অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ (a) বলছে খুব ভালোভাবে শিখেছে, এবং (c)/(d) বলছে আংশিক বা অসম্পূর্ণভাবে শিখেছে—এসব কাহিনীর বাস্তব উদ্ধৃতিকে মেনে চলে না।

b. সহায়ক শিক্ষকের
c. অথর্ব শিক্ষাব্যবস্থা
d. উন্নত স্থান


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রথমে নির্ধারণ করতে হবে কোন উপাদানটি পাখিকে শেখাতে সবচেয়ে মৌলিক — পরিবেশ, শিক্ষক, নীতি না স্থান।  
ধাপ ২: প্যারোটের শেখার শুরুতে পরিমিত, নিরাপদ এবং উৎসাহব্যঞ্জক পরিবেশ বা উন্নত স্থান থাকা সবচেয়ে জরুরি, কারণ সঠিক পরিবেশ ছাড়া পাখি মনোযোগ ও অনুশীলনে মনোনিবেশ করতে পারে না। তাই সঠিক শিখনস্থান প্রথম চাহিদা।  
ধাপ ৩: অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো সহায়ক হলেও পরবর্তীকালে প্রযোজ্য — সঠিক কাঁটা বা সহায়ক শিক্ষক দরকার তবে তার আগেই উপযুক্ত স্থান থাকা প্রয়োজন; কঠোর শিক্ষাব্যবস্থা প্রথমিক নয়।

b. সোনালী খাঁচা তৈরি করা
c. যন্ত্রপাতি প্রদান
d. শিক্ষক নিয়োগ


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান: 

Step 1: শব্দগত বিশ্লেষণ — "গোল্ডস্মিথ" শব্দের অর্থ হল স্বর্ণকার, অর্থাৎ স্বর্ণ দিয়ে বস্তু তৈরি বা নকশা করার কাজ।  
Step 2: কাজ নির্ধারণ — স্বর্ণকার সাধারণত সোনার তারকা, গয়না বা সোনার খাঁচা ইত্যাদি তৈরি করে, তাই সঠিক উত্তরে খ (সোনালী খাঁচা তৈরি করা)।  

ব্যাখ্যা: ক (পাখির শিক্ষা করা) পাখিপালক বা প্রশিক্ষকের কাজ, গ (যন্ত্রপাতি প্রদান) এবং ঘ (শিক্ষক নিয়োগ) প্রশাসনিক বা সরবরাহ সংক্রান্ত কাজ; এগুলো গোল্ডস্মিথের প্রফেশনাল কাজ নয়।

ধাপ ২: দেওয়া বিকল্পগুলোর মধ্যে খ “শিক্ষার উন্নয়ন করা” সবচেয়ে প্রাসঙ্গিক—কারণ শিক্ষকদের কার্যক্রম সাধারণত পাঠদান, দক্ষতা বৃদ্ধিসহ শিক্ষাগত উন্নতি ঘটানোই লক্ষ্য করে।  
ধাপ ৩: অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো অপ্রযোজ্য—ক (পাখির প্রতি সহানুভূতি) উচ্চারণগত বা পারস্পরিক মনোভাব হলেও মূল উদ্দেশ্য নয়; গ (গতিবিধি প্রতিরোধ করা) ও ঘ (গণনা ও গোপনে শিক্ষাদান করা) প্রশিক্ষণের প্রধান লক্ষ্য হিসেবে সমর্থিত নয়।

Question:
How does the portrayal of education in 'The Parrot’s Tale' compare to the role of AI in modern classrooms as discussed in the second chapter?

Options:
a. Both emphasize the importance of knowledge retention without practical application.
b. Both highlight the need for personalized learning experiences that engage students meaningfully.
c. Both suggest that technology can replace traditional teaching methods entirely.
d. Both indicate that education is solely about achieving good grades.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the theme in the story — "The Parrot’s Tale" emphasizes learning that adapts to the learner’s needs and keeps the student engaged rather than rote memorization.  
Step 2: Identify the chapter’s point — the second chapter describes AI in classrooms as a tool for personalized, interactive learning that tailors content and pace to each student.  
Step 3: Compare and choose — both the story and the chapter stress meaningful, personalized learning experiences, so b is correct.

Why the other options are incorrect:
- a is wrong because neither source advocates knowledge retention without application; both value engagement and relevance.  
- c is wrong because both portray technology as a supplement to teaching, not a complete replacement.  
- d is wrong because education in both texts is broader than merely achieving grades.

How does the portrayal of education in 'The Parrot's Tale' contrast with the potential benefits of AI in the classroom as discussed in the article on education and technology?

Options:
a. Both portrayals emphasize the importance of practical skills over theoretical knowledge.
b. While 'The Parrot's Tale' highlights the futility of misguided education, the AI article stresses the personalization and efficiency of learning.
c. Both sources argue that education should focus on rote memorization to ensure student success.
d. The story promotes traditional education methods while the article advocates for complete reliance on AI.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify main point of 'The Parrot's Tale': it shows the futility of misguided or surface-level education that lacks real understanding.  
2. Identify main point of the AI article: it emphasizes personalization, efficiency, and improved learning when AI is used appropriately.  
3. Comparison: these are contrasting emphases — the tale warns about useless/misapplied education, while the article presents AI as a tool to make education more tailored and effective — so option b is correct.  
4. Why other options are wrong: a and c incorrectly claim both sources prioritize practical skills or rote memorization, which they do not; d is wrong because the story does not simply promote traditional methods nor does the article argue for complete reliance on AI.

Options:
a. Keep it as a pet
b. Use it for entertainment
c. Teach it to speak
d. Release it back into the wild


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the relevant sentence in the passage and identify the king’s stated intention (look for verbs like “teach,” “train,” or direct quotes).  
Step 2: Match that intention to the choices: the text explicitly indicates the king wanted the bird to learn speech, so option (c) “Teach it to speak” is the clear match.  
Explanation of alternatives: options (a) “Keep it as a pet,” (b) “Use it for entertainment,” and (d) “Release it back into the wild” are not supported by the stated intention in the text, so they are incorrect.

Question:
How did the bird change after being caged?

Options:
a. It became more vocal
b. It lost its ability to sing
c. It became aggressive
d. It learned new tricks


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the scenario — caging a bird restricts its freedom and often causes stress or loss of spirit.  
Step 2: Infer the most direct effect — stress and confinement typically silence a bird, making it stop singing.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: (a) becoming more vocal contradicts the usual effect of stress; (c) becoming aggressive can happen but is less directly implied; (d) learning new tricks is unlikely from mere confinement.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) it lost its ability to sing.

Options:
a. It's better to give someone something than to teach them.
b. Education has long-lasting benefits.
c. People need to rely on others for food.
d. Fishing is a more sustainable way to eat.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the meaning of each clause — "give a person a fish" = provide immediate help; "teach a person to fish" = provide a lasting skill.  
Step 2: Interpret the proverb’s contrast — short-term aid versus long-term self-sufficiency and independence.  
Step 3: Match this interpretation to the options: option b ("Education has long-lasting benefits") directly captures teaching a skill that feeds someone for a lifetime, so b is correct.

Why the others are wrong: option a wrongly favors one-time giving over teaching; option c incorrectly claims dependence is the point; option d literalizes fishing instead of the proverb’s broader lesson about learning and empowerment.

In the story, what happened to the bird after it was caged and educated?

Options:
a. It learned to sing beautifully.
b. It became weak and eventually died.
c. It lived happily in the cage.
d. It escaped from the cage.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the part of the story describing the bird after it was caged and educated — the narration states that confinement and the artificial training harmed its natural strength.  
Step 2: From that description we infer the outcome: the bird became weak over time and eventually died, which matches option (b).  
Reasoning why others are incorrect: option (a) is not supported because the text emphasizes decline rather than beautiful singing; option (c) contradicts the clear portrayal of suffering in the cage; option (d) is false because the bird did not escape but succumbed to weakness.

ধাপ 2: শিক্ষকরা পাখির প্রকৃতও প্রয়োজন (আরাম, স্বতন্ত্র প্রয়োগ, প্রকৃত অনুশীলন) বুঝতে পারেননি এবং কেবল বাহ্যিক পদ্ধতি বা ভুল উপায়ে পড়ানোর চেষ্টা করেছিলেন — অর্থাৎ তারা পাখিটির স্বতন্ত্র শিক্ষা-চাহিদা ধরতে পারেনি।

বাকি অপশনগুলোর ভুল: a অসম্পূর্ণ — রাজা শুধুমাত্র শৃঙ্খলা নয়, তিনি ফল প্রত্যাশায় ছিলেন; b ভুল — উভয়ে সমানভাবে বিনিয়োগ করেছিল না; c অতিরঞ্জিত — রাজা কেবল বাহ্যিক চেহারার প্রতি যত্নশীল ছিল বললে শিক্ষকদের অসতর্কতা/অবহেলা মিশিয়ে দেওয়া হয়, যা গল্পের মুল পার্থক্যকে পুরোপুরি ব্যাখ্যা করে না।

Question:
কীভাবে শিক্ষা আমাদের জীবনে দীর্ঘস্থায়ী প্রভাব ফেলে, এবং এটি আমাদের দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি তৈরি করতে কিভাবে সাহায্য করে?

Options:
a. শিক্ষা শুধুমাত্র পরীক্ষার জন্য প্রয়োজনীয়।
b. শিক্ষা আমাদের সৃজনশীলতা ও সামাজিক সচেতনতা বৃদ্ধি করে।
c. শিক্ষা কেবল চাকরি পাওয়ার জন্য দরকার।
d. শিক্ষা আমাদের ব্যবহারিক জীবনে কোন প্রভাব ফেলে না।


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:  
ধাপ ১: শিক্ষা ব্যাক্তির জ্ঞানের মাত্রা বাড়ায় এবং চিন্তাশক্তি, বিশ্লেষণ ও সমস্যা সমাধানের ক্ষমতা গড়ে তোলে, ফলে তার সিদ্ধান্ত ও জীবনধারা দীর্ঘসময় প্রভাবিত হয়।  
ধাপ ২: একই সঙ্গে শিক্ষা সৃজনশীলতা বাড়ায় এবং সামাজিক সচেতনতা, নৈতিকতা ও সহযোগিতার ভাবনা জাগ্রত করে, যা আমাদের দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি গঠনে সরাসরি সাহায্য করে।  
এ কারণেই বিকল্প b: "শিক্ষা আমাদের সৃজনশীলতা ও সামাজিক সচেতনতা বৃদ্ধি করে" সঠিক। বিকল্প a ও c খুব সংকীর্ণ দৃষ্টিকোণ (শুধু পরীক্ষা বা চাকরি) উপস্থাপন করে এবং d সম্পূর্ণ ভুল কারণ শিক্ষা স্পষ্টভাবে জীবন ও চিন্তার উপর প্রভাব ফেলে।

What does education primarily aim to do?

Options:
a. Provide entertainment

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the primary purpose of education — to develop learners' understanding, abilities, and critical thinking so they can function effectively in society.  
Step 2: Match this purpose to the options: "Foster knowledge and skills" directly states that aim, so it fits best.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out the others: "Provide entertainment" is a secondary benefit, "Increase wealth" can be an outcome but not the main aim, and "Ensure obedience" is not a fundamental educational goal.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) Foster knowledge and skills.

Question:
Why is the proverb "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime" important in understanding education?

Options:
a. It emphasizes the importance of immediate help
b. It suggests that education should be short and quick
c. It highlights the long-term benefits of learning skills
d. It shows that fishing is a necessary skill


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish solves a one-time need, teaching to fish builds a lasting ability.  
Step 2: Relate to education — education that teaches skills and methods empowers a person to sustain themselves over the long term.  
Step 3: Choose the best option — (c) is correct because it states the long-term benefits of learning skills.  
Briefly why others are wrong: (a) focuses only on immediate help, (b) wrongly implies education should be brief, and (d) reads the proverb literally about fishing rather than its educational meaning.

Options:
a. Rote memorization
b. Real-life application of skills
c. Theoretical knowledge
d. Historical learning


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: নিরীক্ষণ — প্রশ্নটিতে ছাত্র কাউন্সিলেটর ব্যবহার করে গণিত সমস্যা সমাধান শিখছে, যা বাস্তব কর্মে একটি সরঞ্জাম ব্যবহার করে দক্ষতা প্রয়োগ করার উদাহরণ।  
Step 2: উপযুক্ত শ্রেণীবিভাগ নির্ধারণ — এটি স্পষ্টভাবে দক্ষতার বাস্তব-জীবন প্রয়োগ, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো b (Real-life application of skills)।  
Step 3: অপশন বর্জন — a (rote memorization) মানে শুধু মুখস্ত করা, যা এখানে নেই; c (theoretical knowledge) হলো তাত্ত্বিক ধারণা, বাস্তব প্রয়োগ নয়; d (historical learning) সম্পূর্ণভাবে প্রসঙ্গহীন।

Compare the roles of a teacher and a student. Which of the following statements is true?

Options:
a. Teachers only give information without interaction
b. Students learn passively and do not contribute
c. Teachers guide and support students' learning
d. Students know more than teachers


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the typical roles — a teacher’s role is to facilitate, guide, explain and support learning; a student’s role is to engage, ask questions and actively construct understanding.  
Step 2: Evaluate each option against these roles: option (a) is false because effective teaching involves interaction and feedback; option (b) is false because students actively participate and contribute to learning; option (d) is generally false because teachers are expected to have more subject knowledge and pedagogical experience.  
Therefore option (c) is true: teachers guide and support students' learning.

Challenge Question: Create a new proverb that reflects the importance of education in your community. What would it be?

Options:
a. Education is like a river that never dries
b. Learning is a treasure that no one can steal
c. Knowledge is a garden; you need to nurture it
d. Wisdom comes from books and not from life


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the goal — choose the proverb that best emphasizes education as something that must be actively grown and maintained within the community.
Step 2: Compare options against that criterion:
- Option c ("Knowledge is a garden; you need to nurture it") portrays education as something that requires ongoing care, participation, and community effort — a direct match.
Step 3: Reject the others briefly:
- Option a ("Education is like a river that never dries") suggests permanence but not the active, communal effort of nurturing.
- Option b ("Learning is a treasure that no one can steal") highlights value and security but lacks the idea of cultivation and ongoing work.
- Option d ("Wisdom comes from books and not from life") is overly restrictive and ignores experiential learning, so it’s inappropriate.
Conclusion: Choose option c because it best reflects the importance of actively nurturing education in the community.

What is the primary purpose of education according to the proverb mentioned in "The Parrot's Tale"?

Options:
a. To get good grades
b. To learn how to fish
c. To make friends
d. To memorize texts


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the proverb used in "The Parrot's Tale" — it conveys the idea of teaching someone a skill so they can provide for themselves (as in "teach a person to fish").  
Step 2: Interpret the message: the primary purpose of education in that proverb is to make a person self-reliant by teaching practical skills. Therefore the correct choice is (b) To learn how to fish.  
Explanation why others are wrong: (a) Getting good grades is a narrow outcome, not the proverb’s focus; (c) Making friends is social, not the proverb’s moral; (d) Memorizing texts is rote learning, whereas the proverb emphasizes practical, lasting ability.

Options:
a. To entertain the royal family
b. To improve the bird's manners
c. To increase the bird's value
d. To make the bird sing better


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: স্মৃতিকে উপর ভিত্তি করে গল্পে বোঝা যায় যে রাজা পাখিটিকে বিশেষভাবে শিক্ষিত করিয়েছিলেন যাতে তার কদর বাড়ে — ভালভাবে কথা বলা বা বিদ্যা শেখা পাখিটির মূল্য বাড়ায়।  
Step 2: তাই মূল উদ্দেশ্য ছিল পাখিটির আর্থিক/বস্তুনিষ্ঠ মূল্য বাড়ানো, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল (c) To increase the bird's value.  
অন্য বিকল্পগুলোকে সংক্ষেপে খারিজ করা: (a) বিনোদন সম্ভবত ফলাফল হতে পারে কিন্তু প্রধান উদ্দেশ্য নয়; (b) আচরণ উন্নত করানো গল্পে প্রধান কারণ হিসেবে উল্লেখ নেই; (d) গান উন্নত করা নয় — মূলত মূল্যবৃদ্ধিই লক্ষ্য।

ধাপ ২: প্রতিটি বিকল্প মূল্যায়ন করুন:
- ক অতিরিক্ত প্রতিযোগিতা তৈরি করে — শিক্ষা কখনও কখনও প্রতিযোগিতা বাড়ায়, কিন্তু এটি সরাসরি জীবনমান উন্নতির মৌলিক উপায় নয়।  
- খ প্রয়োজনবান মানুষদের সাহায্য করে — সঠিক কারণ শিক্ষা দক্ষতা, স্বাস্থ্যবোধ, আর্থিক সচেতনতা ও সামাজিক অংশগ্রহণ বাড়িয়ে মানুষকে স্বাবলম্বী করে এবং দুর্বলদের সাহায্য করতে সক্ষম করে, ফলে সামগ্রিক জীবনমান উন্নত হয়।  
- গ ধন-সম্পদ বৃদ্ধি করে — শিক্ষা আয় বাড়াতে সাহায্য করতে পারে, তবে এটি জীবনমান উন্নতির একটি উপকরণ; সরাসরি ও সর্বজনীন ফল নয়।  
- ঘ আরও স্কুল তৈরি করে — স্কুল তৈরি করা একটি কর্ম বা নীতি; শিক্ষা নিজেই স্কুল তৈরি করে না।

Solution:
Solution: Civic engagement means taking actions that contribute to the public good or improve the community. Option b, "Helping to clean a local park," is a direct example because it involves voluntary participation to improve a shared public space. The other choices are personal activities: studying for exams (personal development), watching TV, and playing video games (leisure), so they are not civic engagement.

b. By involving the community in the learning process
c. By reducing the number of teachers

Correct Answer: b

Options:
a. Fishing is a fun activity
b. It helps them become self-reliant
c. It is a sport
d. Fish is not available in markets


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb—knowing how to fish means learning a skill that lets someone provide for themselves rather than relying on others.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: option b ("It helps them become self-reliant") directly matches that meaning.

Step 2: Evaluate options: option (b) "Through community workshops and programs" directly uses educational activities to spread knowledge, demonstrate practices, and encourage behavior change, so it matches the goal. Option (a) is too narrow (only diseases), option (c) provides resources but is not education itself, and option (d) is harmful because withholding information reduces awareness.

Solution:
সমাধান:

ধাপ ১: স্থানীয় রীতিনীতি ও প্রবাদ-প্রবচন শিক্ষার্থীর জানা-অচেনা বিষয়কে তাদের নিজ সংস্কৃতির সাথে সংযুক্ত করে, ফলে শেখা বেশি প্রাসঙ্গিক ও সহজবোধ্য হয়।

If you were the King in 'The Parrot's Tale,' how would you change the education approach for the bird?

Options:
a. Keep improving the cage
b. Focus on teaching practical skills
c. Stop the lessons altogether
d. Hire more teachers


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Choose option (b) — focus on teaching practical skills — because the parrot’s long-term well‑being depends on abilities (foraging, problem solving, communication) rather than a better confinement or more teachers.  
Step 2: Method: assess the bird’s real needs, design hands‑on lessons (e.g., finding food, using tools, social cues) and practice gradually so the parrot becomes independent.  
Step 3: Why others are wrong: option (a) only improves the environment but not the bird’s capability; option (c) halts development; option (d) adds resources without changing ineffective content, so hiring more teachers won’t help unless the teaching focus is practical.

What is the primary goal of education according to the proverb mentioned in "The Parrot's Tale"?

Options:
a. To feed a person for a day
b. To provide lifelong skills
c. To teach manners
d. To make money


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the proverb in "The Parrot's Tale" (similar to “teach a man to fish”), which emphasizes giving someone a skill that lasts rather than a one-time benefit.  
Step 2: Interpret the proverb’s message: education’s primary aim is to equip a person with lasting abilities so they can sustain themselves. Therefore the correct choice is b (To provide lifelong skills).

বাকী বিকল্পগুলির সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা:  
a (To feed a person for a day) — অস্থায়ী সহায়তার কথা বলে, যা প্রবাদটির মূল বক্তব্য নয়।  
c (To teach manners) — শিষ্টাচার শেখানো উপকারী কিন্তু প্রবাদে মূল লক্ষ্য নয়।  
d (To make money) — উপার্জন হতে পারে শিক্ষার ফল, কিন্তু প্রবাদে লক্ষ্য দীর্ঘমেয়াদি দক্ষতা অর্জন।

Question:
In what way does the story "The Parrot's Tale" reflect the importance of critical thinking in education?

Options:
a. It shows the need for a beautiful cage.
b. It emphasizes teaching without understanding.
c. It illustrates the dangers of rote learning.
d. It suggests that all birds should sing.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the story’s main message — the parrot repeats words or lessons without understanding, which highlights the limits of memorization.
Step 2: Compare options: a and d are irrelevant metaphors, b describes teaching without understanding (related but frames the teacher, not the consequence), while c explicitly names the harmful practice shown in the story.
Step 3: The story demonstrates that repeating facts without comprehension leads to misunderstanding and failure to apply knowledge, so the best answer is c.

Options:
a. Teachers should only focus on scores.
b. Teachers should teach with creativity.
c. Teachers are unnecessary in education.
d. Teachers should punish students for mistakes.

Question:
What is the main purpose of education according to the proverb "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"?

Options:
a. To provide temporary help.
b. To empower individuals for lifelong skills.
c. To ensure financial success.
d. To limit personal growth.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Interpret the proverb: "Give a person a fish" means providing immediate, short-term help, while "teach a person to fish" means giving skills that allow long-term self-sufficiency.  
Step 2 — Match to options: the proverb emphasizes empowering individuals with lifelong skills, so the correct choice is b.  
Briefly, options a and d describe limited or negative outcomes that contradict the proverb’s intent, and option c (ensuring financial success) is narrower than the proverb’s broader focus on sustainable ability.

Question:
In "The Parrot's Tale," what was the King's initial view of the uneducated bird?

Options:
a. It was a valuable companion.
b. It was a nuisance.
c. It was an exceptional singer.
d. It was a wise teacher.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
The method is to recall the opening description of the story: the King encountered a parrot that could not speak or recite properly and caused annoyance. The text explicitly presents the King's first reaction as displeasure and irritation, so he regarded the uneducated bird as a nuisance. Therefore the correct choice is (b); the other options are incorrect because the bird was not described as valuable, an exceptional singer, or a wise teacher at that point.

Question:
Why did the scholars decide that the bird needed a proper cage for education?

Options:
a. To make it look more presentable.
b. Because it could not hold knowledge in its nest.
c. To contain its wild behavior.
d. To impress the King.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the intended meaning — the scholars decided a proper cage was needed because the bird’s natural nest was not suitable to hold or convey knowledge in a controlled, teachable way.  
Step 2: Interpret the metaphor — a cage here represents a structured, secure environment for education where knowledge can be kept and imparted reliably, which matches option (b).  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices — (a) “to make it look more presentable” is superficial and unrelated to learning; (c) “to contain its wild behavior” focuses on discipline rather than preserving knowledge; (d) “to impress the King” attributes a political motive not supported by the premise.  

Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
If the King were to witness the bird's education today, what would be the most critical aspect to evaluate?

Options:
a. The decoration of the cage.
b. The singing ability of the bird.
c. The teaching methods used.
d. The number of texts available.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the goal — the King wants to judge the quality of the bird’s education, so we must look for the aspect that most directly determines learning outcomes.  
Step 2: Compare options: the decoration of the cage (cosmetic), the bird’s singing ability (an outcome), the teaching methods used (the process that produces learning), the number of texts available (a resource).  
Step 3: Conclude that teaching methods are most critical because they determine how effectively the bird learns, generalize to new skills, and influence welfare and long‑term retention; therefore option (c) is correct.  
Brief note on other options: decoration is irrelevant to education, singing ability is only the result of instruction, and number of texts is secondary to how those resources are used.

How does the story suggest education should be approached to be effective?

Options:
a. By focusing solely on theoretical knowledge.
b. By integrating practical experiences with learning.
c. By prioritizing discipline over understanding.
d. By emphasizing rote memorization.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the story's main message — it emphasizes learners applying ideas in real situations and learning by doing, not only hearing facts.

Step 2: Match that message to the options: option b ("integrating practical experiences with learning") directly reflects learning through practice plus theory.

Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a (solely theoretical) and option d (rote memorization) ignore practical application; option c (prioritizing discipline over understanding) focuses on control rather than meaningful learning.

Conclusion: Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
If you could redesign the education of the bird, what would you include to ensure it thrives?

Options:
a. Only traditional teaching methods.
b. A mix of practical skills and theoretical knowledge.
c. More ornamental cages for aesthetic appeal.
d. Focus solely on increasing the number of texts.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Determine the goal — to help the bird thrive, education must develop real abilities, health, and understanding, not just appearance or rote content.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: option a limits learning to traditional methods (too narrow), option c focuses on aesthetics (doesn't teach survival or skills), and option d increases texts only (overemphasis on theory without practice).  
Step 3: Option b is correct because a mix of practical skills and theoretical knowledge gives balanced development — practical training improves survival/behavior while theory explains reasons and promotes flexible problem-solving.

Question:
What is the main message of the proverb "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"?

Options:
a. Teaching is more valuable than temporary help.
b. Fishing is a necessary life skill.
c. People should not rely on others.
d. Proverbial sayings are always true.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish meets an immediate need (short-term relief), while teaching to fish provides a skill that ensures long-term self-sufficiency.  
Step 2: Compare meanings to the options — this emphasizes the greater value of empowering someone with skills rather than providing one-time aid.  
Step 3: Choose the best match — option a ("Teaching is more valuable than temporary help") precisely captures that contrast, so it is correct.  
Why the others are incorrect: b is too literal (the proverb uses fishing as a metaphor), c overgeneralizes (the proverb promotes self-reliance through skill, not discouraging all help), and d is false (proverbs are not universally true in every situation).

Question:
In "The Parrot’s Tale," what did the King realize about the education provided to the bird?

Options:
a. It was comprehensive and effective.
b. The bird was not being properly taught.
c. The bird preferred its cage to freedom.
d. The King had wasted his resources.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Note the king’s observation in the tale — he saw that the parrot did not respond or behave as a properly educated bird should (it lacked expected knowledge or manners).  
Step 2: From that observation the logical inference is that the instruction the bird received was inadequate.  
Therefore the correct choice is (b) the bird was not being properly taught.  
Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they state the opposite (comprehensive teaching), an unrelated preference (cage vs freedom), or an unsupported conclusion about wasted resources.

Question:
Why do you think the King rewarded his nephew with a gold chain?

Options:
a. To show off his wealth.
b. To silence the detractors.
c. To acknowledge the nephew's loyalty.
d. To distract from the bird's condition.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the likely motive — the king’s gift is a targeted response to a social or political problem rather than a casual present.  
Step 2: Reasoning — rewarding the nephew with a gold chain would publicly elevate him and discourage critics, so the action functions to silence detractors (option b).  
Why other options are less likely: giving the chain merely to show off wealth (a) ignores the focused nature of the reward; acknowledging loyalty (c) could be plausible but the context implies a defensive move against criticism rather than simple gratitude; distracting from the bird’s condition (d) is unrelated and therefore unlikely.

Step 1: Read the question and identify the intended positive impact—how technology can improve education.  
Step 2: Evaluate each option against common educational benefits of technology: (a) replacing teachers is unrealistic and undermines pedagogy; (c) making learning less engaging is the opposite of typical technological goals; (d) increasing class sizes is unrelated and usually harmful.  
Step 3: Choose (b) because technology commonly provides personalized learning through adaptive software, data-driven feedback, and tailored resources, which directly improves student outcomes.

Question:
Compare the education methods used for the bird in the story to modern educational practices. What do you think is a better approach?

Options:
a. Rigid teaching methods without flexibility.
b. Personalized and engaging learning experiences.
c. Focus only on theoretical knowledge.
d. Emphasis only on maintaining discipline.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify methods in the story: the bird was taught using a single rigid approach (strict repetition or punishment) rather than adapting to its needs. 
2. Compare to modern practices: effective modern education emphasizes personalization, engagement, and adapting methods to the learner’s pace and interests.
3. Reasoning to answer: a personalized, engaging approach helps motivation, builds real skills, and addresses individual differences, so option b is best.
4. Why others are wrong: option a (rigid methods) and option d (only discipline) ignore learner differences and motivation; option c (only theory) misses practical, active learning—thus they are inferior to option b.

b. Teaching skills is more beneficial than providing temporary help.

Step 2 — Match this outcome to the choices: that description corresponds to option c, "The bird lost its natural abilities." Step 3 — Eliminate others: a is wrong because it did not become a famed singer, b is wrong because it did not regain free flight, and d is wrong because it was not made the King’s pet. Hence the correct answer is c.

Why was the parrot considered uneducated in "The Parrot's Tale"?

Options:
a. It did not fly
b. It could not sing
c. It lacked knowledge and manners

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the story, the parrot is described as being mocked for its behavior and speech—it repeated words without understanding and showed rude manners.  
Step 2: Therefore the reason it was called uneducated is that it "lacked knowledge and manners," which matches option c.  
Step 3: Other options are incorrect because (a) not flying or (b) not singing are not mentioned as signs of being uneducated, and (d) the cage quality is irrelevant to the bird’s education or manners.

If the parrot could speak, what advice might it give about education based on its experiences?

Options:
a. Focus on superficial things
b. Knowledge is not important
c. True learning requires understanding and care
d. Always follow what others say


Correct Answer: c

Solution:

Step 1: Interpret the parrot’s experience — parrots often mimic words without real understanding, so the moral drawn from its experience emphasizes the difference between mere repetition and genuine comprehension.  
Step 2: Choose the best advice — "True learning requires understanding and care" captures that distinction: education should build real understanding, not just superficial performance.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options — focusing on superficial things (a) or saying knowledge is unimportant (b) contradicts the value of real learning, and blindly following others (d) ignores the need for thoughtful, cared-for learning.

Step 1: Identify the story's lesson — the parrot is trained to perform and look pleasing while its true learning, freedom, or well‑being are ignored, so the focus is on outward appearance rather than real education.  
Step 2: Match this with the options: option b states that the bird's cage symbolizes the distractions of superficial education, which directly captures the metaphor (cage = confinement by appearances, not genuine learning).  
Why others are wrong: option a is the opposite of the lesson; option c is too specific and not the central point (the issue is the system, not just the King’s concern); option d misreads the theme — the tale criticizes a style of education, not who benefits.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
In what way does Totto-chan's experience with the headmaster differ from the education of the parrot in Tagore's story?

Options:
a. Totto-chan's education is based on personal connection and communication.
b. Both experiences focus solely on academic achievements.
c. The headmaster is indifferent to Totto-chan's needs.
d. The parrot's education is more personalized than Totto-chan’s.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Totto-chan’s experience — the headmaster listens to her, understands her needs, and adapts lessons and school life to her personality, so her education is built on a personal connection and communication.

Step 2: Identify the parrot’s education in Tagore’s story — the parrot is trained in a more mechanical, rote way for a specific purpose (recitation/performing), lacking a human-like personal dialogue or emotional understanding.

Step 3: Compare and conclude — because Totto-chan’s learning is individualized and relational while the parrot’s is impersonal and mechanical, option (a) is correct.

Why other options are incorrect:
- (b) is wrong: both stories value more than just academic achievement; Totto-chan’s schooling emphasizes personal growth.
- (c) is wrong: the headmaster is attentive and responsive, not indifferent.
- (d) is wrong: the parrot’s training is less personalized than Totto-chan’s.

Question:
What common theme is reflected in both The Parrot's Tale and the article about AI in classrooms regarding the effectiveness of education?

Options:
a. Education is solely about acquiring knowledge.
b. External appearances can mislead us about educational success.
c. Technology will replace traditional forms of teaching.
d. Only practical skills matter in education.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the shared theme — both "The Parrot's Tale" and the article about AI in classrooms highlight that apparent success (good test scores, polished performance, or surface-level demonstration) can hide a lack of real understanding or meaningful learning.  
Step 2: Match this theme to the options — option b ("External appearances can mislead us about educational success") directly captures that idea.  
Step 3: Eliminate others — option a is wrong because the works stress depth of learning, not just knowledge acquisition; option c is wrong because the AI article does not claim technology will fully replace traditional teaching, it questions measures of effectiveness; option d is wrong because both sources value understanding and critical thinking, not only practical skills.

Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
How does the concept of civic engagement relate to the educational experiences depicted in Totto-chan's story?

Options:
a. Both stories ignore the importance of community involvement.
b. Totto-chan’s school emphasizes cooperation and engagement with others.
c. Civic engagement is irrelevant to the educational narrative.
d. Totto-chan's learning is entirely individualistic.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:

Step 2: Observe Totto-chan’s educational setting: her school emphasizes group activities, respect for others, collaboration, and learning from real-world, community-oriented experiences.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is option b: Totto-chan’s school emphasizes cooperation and engagement with others.  
Why other options are wrong: option a is false because the story highlights community involvement; option c is wrong because civic engagement is directly relevant to the narrative; option d is incorrect because Totto-chan’s learning is shown as social and collaborative, not purely individualistic.

Question:
What can be inferred about the role of the headmaster in Totto-chan's education compared to the teachers in The Parrot's Tale?

Options:
a. The headmaster is more focused on standardized testing.
b. The headmaster values student voice, while the teachers prioritize rigid structure.
c. Both figures are uninterested in student welfare.
d. The headmaster uses technology to teach, unlike the teachers in the tale.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Identify the headmaster’s approach in Totto‑chan — he listens to students, values their voices and individuality, and adapts the environment to support their growth.  
Step 2: Identify the teachers’ approach in The Parrot’s Tale — they emphasize strict rules, conformity and rigid structure rather than student expression.  
Step 3: Compare and conclude — the headmaster’s emphasis on student voice contrasts with the teachers’ focus on rigidity, so option (b) is correct.  
Why the others are wrong: (a) is incorrect because the headmaster is not depicted as centered on standardized testing; (c) is wrong because both narratives show concern for students, albeit in different ways; (d) is incorrect because the distinction is about pedagogy and voice, not use of technology.

Question:
In what way do Totto-chan's school and the educational experience of the parrot reflect different attitudes towards teaching?

Options:
a. Both prioritize formal education over personal growth.
b. Totto-chan's school promotes creativity, while the parrot's education is constricted.
c. The parrot's education is more innovative than Totto-chan's experience.
d. Both stories depict the same educational philosophies.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Identify Totto-chan’s school attitude — it emphasizes creativity, freedom, and child-centered learning (encouraging play, individual interests, and emotional growth).  
Step 2: Identify the parrot’s educational experience — it is mechanical and constricted, focused on rote training or limited repetition without fostering broader development.  
Step 3: Compare and conclude — these show contrasting approaches: Totto-chan’s is open and creative, the parrot’s is restrictive, so option b is correct.  
Step 4: Why other options are wrong — option a is false because Totto-chan’s school values personal growth over strict formality; option c is false because the parrot’s training is not more innovative; option d is false because the two portray different philosophies.

b. All educational efforts are valuable, regardless of outcome.
c. The bird's physical condition is irrelevant to its education.

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — বোঝা যে রাজা দেখেছে পাখিটি অভ্যন্তরীণভাবে দক্ষতা অর্জন করেছে কিন্তু বাহ্যিকভাবে তা প্রদর্শন করতে পারছে না, তাই সত্যিকারের শেখা কেবল বাহ্যিক সাফল্যের উপর নির্ভর করে না। Step 2 — এ থেকে স্পষ্ট হয় যে কথিত “পিত্তফল” বা অস্থায়ী বাহ্যিক সফলতা আসল শিক্ষার নিশ্চয়তা নয়; তাই বিকল্প a সঠিক। অন্যান্য অপশনগুলো কেন ভুল: b সব প্রচেষ্টা মূল্যবান তা বলছে, যা মূল উপলব্ধির সমাবেশ নন; c বলে পাখির শারীরিক অবস্থা ততটা গুরুত্বহীন, অথচ তা প্রদর্শনের ক্ষমতাকে প্রভাবিত করে; d বলে শেখা কেবল উপস্থাপনামূলক শিক্ষায় হয়, যা পরিস্থিতির মূল পাঠের সাথে সঙ্গতিপূর্ণ নয়।

Options:
a. He emphasizes rigid discipline over student engagement.
b. He listens attentively and encourages self-expression.
c. His focus is solely on academic results.
d. He discourages creativity in learning.

Step 2: Match those behaviors to the options: this corresponds to a student-centered, engaging approach that promotes self-expression and confidence, which is option b.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a (rigid discipline) contradicts his gentle, listening style; option c (sole focus on academics) is wrong because he values holistic development; option d (discouraging creativity) is opposite to his encouragement of creative, experiential learning.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Options:
a. The King prioritized appearance over the bird's actual learning.
b. The King was unaware of the bird’s progress.
c. The King invested wisely in the bird's education.
d. The King did not care about the opinions of others.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Observe the parrot’s fate — it was shown off for its outward accomplishments rather than given true, useful instruction.  
Step 2: Conclude that the King valued appearance and showmanship more than the bird’s real learning, which matches option (a).  
Briefly, option (b) is false because the King did notice and arrange the bird’s training; (c) is wrong because the investment emphasized form over substance; (d) is incorrect because the King did care about others’ opinions (he wanted a spectacular display).

How might the educational approaches in The Parrot's Tale and AI tools contrast in terms of student engagement?

Options:
a. Both approaches ignore student interests.
b. One emphasizes rote learning, while the other promotes interactivity.
c. Both promote student-centered learning.
d. Both approaches are equally engaging.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the typical teaching style in each case — The Parrot's Tale represents a traditional/story-based approach that often relies on repetition and memorization, while AI tools are designed to be interactive, adaptive, and responsive to student input.  
Step 2: Compare engagement methods — repetition/rote learning tends to be passive, whereas interactive AI features (simulations, feedback, personalization) actively involve learners.  
Step 3: Choose the best match — the contrast described fits option b, since one approach emphasizes rote learning and the other promotes interactivity.  
Why other options are wrong: a is incorrect because both do not ignore student interests; c is incorrect because The Parrot's Tale is not necessarily student-centered; d is incorrect because the two are not equally engaging.

Question:
What does the headmaster’s engagement with Totto-chan suggest about the importance of listening in education?

Options:
a. Listening is detrimental to the learning process.
b. Listening fosters a sense of belonging and understanding.
c. Teachers should only lecture without listening.

2. This demonstrates that listening in education fosters a sense of belonging and deeper understanding, so the correct choice is (b).
3. Options (a), (c), and (d) contradict the headmaster’s example: listening is not detrimental, teachers should not only lecture, and listening clearly contributes to effective learning.

Question:
What lesson about the consequences of neglecting individual learning needs can be derived from the parrot's fate?

Options:
a. Neglecting individual needs leads to complete educational failure.
b. Individual needs do not matter in education.
c. All learners should conform to societal standards.
d. Educational structures are infallible.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the premise — the parrot’s fate shows that its particular learning needs (e.g., appropriate teaching methods, attention to its abilities) were ignored.  
Step 2: Infer the consequence — because those individual needs were neglected, the parrot failed to learn or thrive, illustrating a direct link between neglect and educational failure.  
Step 3: Choose the option — this reasoning matches option a: "Neglecting individual needs leads to complete educational failure."  

Explanation of other options: b is wrong because the parrot’s outcome shows individual needs do matter; c is incorrect since forcing conformity ignores individual differences and can cause harm rather than help; d is false because the story demonstrates that educational structures can fail when they disregard individual needs.

Question:
If you were the teacher in "The Parrot's Tale," what methods would you use to effectively educate the bird? Choose the most innovative approach.

Options:
a. Provide only written materials.
b. Use a combination of interactive lessons and practical experiences.
c. Focus only on the bird's weaknesses.
d. Ignore the bird's interests.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
1. Step 1 — Identify goals and baseline: first assess the parrot’s current skills, interests and motivators so teaching targets are clear and achievable.
2. Step 2 — Use interactive lessons + practical experiences: combine short, engaging drills (mimicry games, sound-play), hands-on practice (real-life cues, foraging tasks) and positive reinforcement so the bird learns by doing and stays motivated.
3. Reasoning to choose b: this blended, experiential approach maximizes engagement and retention, which is more effective than passive or one-sided methods.
4. Why others are wrong: a (only written materials) won’t suit a parrot’s learning style; c (focus only on weaknesses) neglects strengths and can demotivate; d (ignore interests) fails to engage the learner. Hence option b is the best choice.

Options:
a. To provide knowledge for a specific time
b. To encourage self-sufficiency
c. To ensure everyone becomes a fisherman
d. To increase dependency on others


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
1. Interpret the proverb: giving a fish solves a short-term need, while teaching to fish provides a lasting skill that lets a person support themselves.
2. Identify the educational goal implied: the proverb emphasizes building abilities and independence rather than temporary aid.
3. Conclusion: the best match is option b — "To encourage self-sufficiency."

Explanation of other options:
- a is incorrect because the proverb contrasts short-term help with lasting ability, so it does not endorse only temporary knowledge.
- c is incorrect because the proverb uses "fishing" as a metaphor for a skill, not a literal requirement that everyone become a fisherman.
- d is incorrect because the proverb promotes reducing dependency by teaching a sustainable skill.

Why did the King in "The Parrot's Tale" want to educate the bird?

Options:
a. To make it a pet
b. To ensure it could sing better
c. To stop it from eating the fruits
d. To improve its usefulness


Correct Answer: d

Solution:

1. Read the passage and identify the king’s motive: the text says the king taught the parrot so it could perform helpful tasks and be more valuable in the palace, i.e., to increase its usefulness.  
2. Match that motive to the choices: this directly corresponds to option (d) "To improve its usefulness."  
3. Why the others are wrong: (a) making it a pet is too narrow and not stated as the goal; (b) improving its singing is not mentioned as the king’s aim; (c) stopping it from eating fruits is a behavioral issue, not the stated reason for education.

Question:
In what way can learning to fish be more beneficial than simply receiving fish?

Options:
a. It requires more effort
b. It provides continuous food
c. It is more enjoyable
d. It takes less time


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb literally and figuratively — "learning to fish" means acquiring a skill, while "receiving fish" means getting a one-time benefit.

Step 2: Compare outcomes: a skill provides ongoing ability to produce food or income, so it yields continuous benefits over time. Therefore option b ("It provides continuous food") correctly captures the long-term advantage.

Step 3: Briefly rule out others: option a ("requires more effort") may be true but is not a benefit; option c ("is more enjoyable") is subjective and not the main point; option d ("it takes less time") is false because learning usually takes more time than receiving a single fish.

1) পর্যবেক্ষণ: গল্পে শিক্ষকরা পাকশালার বাহ্যিক দক্ষতা ও মুহূর্তিক উপস্থাপনের দিকে বেশি মনোযোগ দিয়েছিল, পাখির স্বাস্থ্যের, মানসিক প্রয়োজনের বা প্রকৃত যত্নের প্রতি উদাসীন ছিলেন।  
2) বিশ্লেষণ: বাহ্যিক ট্রিক, শোভা বা আড়ম্বর বৃদ্ধির জন্য পাখির মৌলিক চাহিদা উপেক্ষিত হওয়ায় তার অবস্থা খারাপ হয়ে যায় — অর্থাৎ উন্নতির বদলে অবনতি ঘটে।  
3) উপসংহার: এই আচরণ নির্দেশ করে তাদের পদ্ধতি ছিল গভীর যত্নের বদলে বাহ্যিক/সুপারফিশিয়াল উন্নতির ওপর কেন্দ্রিত, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো a।  

অন্যান্য অপশনগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত বর্জন: b–কোন আর্থিক প্ররোচনার स्पष्ट উল্লেখ নেই; c ও d–যদি তারা সত্যিই পাখির কল্যাণে আন্তরিক থাকত বা সংযোগ রাখত, তবে অবনতি কর্মে পরিণত হত না।

Question:
If you were the teacher in "The Parrot's Tale," how would you educate the bird differently to ensure its wellbeing? Explain your approach in one sentence.

Options:
a. Focus on teaching practical skills through fun activities
b. Assign it to study for long hours without breaks
c. Isolate it from other birds to avoid distractions
d. Provide it with only theoretical knowledge


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান: ধাপ ১ — পাখাটির শারীরিক ও মানসিক চাহিদা (খেলা, সামাজিকীকরণ, বিশ্রাম, ব্যবহারিক দক্ষতা) নিরূপণ করব। ধাপ ২ — বিকল্পগুলো বিশ্লেষণ করে দেখা যায় যে a অপশনটি বাস্তব অভিজ্ঞতা ও মজাদার অনুশীলনের মাধ্যমে সুস্থতা বাড়ায়, whereas b (দীর্ঘসময়ের পড়াশোনা) মানসিক ও শারীরিক চাপ বাড়ায়, c (বিরক্তি এড়াতে আলাদা করা) সামাজিক আচরণ নষ্ট করে এবং d (শুধু তাত্ত্বিক জ্ঞান) বাস্তব দক্ষতা দেয় না। আমার এক-সারির পদ্ধতি: "আমি পাখাটিকে খেলাধুলা ও রঙিন, ব্যবহারিক অনুশীলনের মাধ্যমে বাস্তবিক দক্ষতা শেখাব যাতে সে শারীরিক ও মানসিকভাবে সুস্থ থাকে।"

Question:
What is the main purpose of education according to the proverb, "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime?"

Options:
a. To provide temporary relief
b. To foster lifelong skills
c. To ensure wealth accumulation
d. To create competitions


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish provides a one-time benefit, while teaching to fish provides a lasting skill that enables self-sufficiency.  
Step 2: Match this meaning to the options: option b ("To foster lifelong skills") directly expresses the idea of teaching a durable ability.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.  
Why others are incorrect: option a describes the one-time help (wrong because proverb favors long-term benefit), option c (wealth accumulation) and option d (create competitions) are unrelated to the proverb's focus on skills and self-reliance.

Question:
In "The Parrot's Tale," what conclusion did the scholars reach about the bird's ignorance?

Options:
a. It was due to lack of food.
b. It was because of its cage.
c. Its environment needed change.
d. Education was unnecessary for it.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: In the tale the scholars investigated why the parrot remained ignorant and observed its living conditions.  
Step 2: They concluded that the bird’s ignorance was caused by its confinement — the cage restricted its freedom, exposure, and opportunities to learn, so they blamed the cage.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is (b). Other options are less fitting: lack of food (a) would affect health not necessarily learning, saying the environment needed change (c) is vague compared to the specific cage, and claiming education was unnecessary (d) contradicts the story’s premise that the parrot could learn if freed.

Which of the following is a real-life application of education's importance as depicted in the story?

Options:
a. Learning to cook
b. Playing sports
c. Understanding local laws
d. Fishing techniques


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what the story emphasizes — practical, livelihood-related benefits of education (a skill directly used in daily life).
Step 2: Compare options: learning to cook and playing sports are useful but not the specific example; understanding local laws is important but more abstract; fishing techniques is a concrete, real-life skill tied to earning a living.
Therefore the correct answer is d because the story shows education applied to learn fishing techniques that improve real-life outcomes; the other options do not match that specific depiction.

Question:
Analyze the role of the King’s nephews in "The Parrot's Tale." How did their actions reflect on the educational system?

Options:
a. They prioritized the bird's comfort over education.
b. They focused solely on financial gain.
c. They sincerely aimed to improve the bird.
d. They showed disregard for the King's orders.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the nephews’ actions: they pampered the parrot (luxurious cage, constant comfort, flattery) instead of giving it real instruction or disciplined training.  
Step 2 — Interpret what those actions imply about education: this shows an approach that values comfort and superficial care over genuine learning, critical teaching, or rigorous training.  
Conclusion — Therefore a is correct: they prioritized the bird's comfort over education.  
Why the others are wrong: b is incorrect because their actions were not mainly about money; c is incorrect because they did not sincerely aim to improve the bird’s learning; d is incorrect because their behavior reflects misplaced priorities rather than open defiance of the King.

ধাপ ২: প্রতিটি বিকল্প মূল্যায়ন করুন—(a) শংসাপত্র পাওয়াই একমাত্র লক্ষ্য বলে সীমাবদ্ধ করে, (c) কেবল ছাত্রদের জন্য বললে বড় জনগোষ্ঠী বাদ পড়ে, (d) এটি কেবল অবসর সময় কাটানোর উপায় হিসেবে দেখলে শিক্ষার মৌলিক উদ্দেশ্য উপেক্ষিত হয়।

Options:
a. কারণ এটি বিশ্বের অন্য দেশের কাছে পরিচিত হতে সাহায্য করে
b. কারণ এটি আমাদের জাতির পরিচয় এবং ঐতিহ্যকে তুলে ধরে
c. কারণ এটি আমাদের অর্থনীতি বাড়ায়
d. কারণ এটি কেবল একটি ফ্যাশন


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:

ধাপ ১: ভাষা ও সংস্কৃতি রক্ষা করার প্রধান উদ্দেশ্য হলো একটি জাতির পরিচয়, ইতিহাস ও ঐতিহ্য সংরক্ষণ করা — যা সমাজকে ঐক্যবদ্ধ করে এবং ভবিষ্যৎ প্রজন্মকে মূলধারা সম্পর্কে জানায়।  
ধাপ ২: বিকল্পগুলো বিচার করলে দেখা যায় খ ("কারণ এটি আমাদের জাতির পরিচয় এবং ঐতিহ্যকে তুলে ধরে") সরাসরি এই মূল কারণকে ব্যক্ত করে, তাই এটি সঠিক।  
ধাপ ৩: অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো অযৌক্তিক বা আপাতত উপ-কারণ — (a) বিদেশে পরিচিতি বাড়াতে পারে কিন্তু প্রধান উদ্দেশ্য নয়, (c) অর্থনীতি বাড়া কেবল সম্ভাব্য পার্শ্বপ্রভাব, এবং (d) শুধুই ফ্যাশন হওয়া ভুল ধারণা। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল b.

Solution:
সমাধান: সঠিকভাবে মাছ ধরার সবচেয়ে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ হলো মাছ ধরার জন্য উপযুক্ত স্থান এবং সময় নির্বাচন করা। কারণ মাছের উপস্থিতি ও সক্রিয়তা মূলত স্থান (L) এবং সময় (T)-এর ওপর নির্ভর করে; তাই সফলতার সম্ভাব্যতা প্রায় [math]S \propto L \times T[/math]—যদি সঠিক স্থান ও সময় না থাকে, ভাল জাল বা সঙ্গী থাকলেও ধরা খুব কম হবে। অন্যান্য অপশনগুলি—শুধুমাত্র একটি জাল থাকা, শুধুমাত্র বন্ধুদের সাথে যাওয়া, বা বড় জাল ব্যবহার করা—সবই সহায়ক হতে পারে কিন্তু স্থান ও সময়ের চেয়েও কার্যকরভাবে ফলপ্রসূ নয়। অতএব সঠিক উত্তর: b.

a. আবহাওয়ার পরিবর্তন
b. অনেক কাজ করা
c. শহরে যাওয়া
d. ধান কাটার সময়


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: সমস্যার ব্যাপ্তি ও প্রভাব বিবেচনা করে দেখুন — যে সমস্যা স্থায়ীভাবে ফসল উৎপাদন, বাম্পার বা তুচ্ছ ঝুঁকি বাড়ায় এবং সমগ্র দেশের কৃষি কার্যক্রমে অস্থিরতা সৃষ্টি করে সেটিই সবচেয়ে বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ।  
ধাপ ২: আবহাওয়ার পরিবর্তন (বৃষ্টিপাতের অনিয়ম, তাপমাত্রা পরিবর্তন, বন্যা/খরা) সরাসরি ফসলের ফলন ও কৃষকের আয়কে প্রভাবিত করে, তাই এটি সর্বাধিক গুরুত্বপূর্ন। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো — খ অনেক কাজ করা (শ্রমিক সমস্যা, কিন্তু সীমিত অপারেশনাল), গ শহরে যাওয়া (ব্যক্তিগত সিদ্ধান্ত/অবসান), ঘ ধান কাটার সময় (নির্দিষ্ট কাজের সময়) — এগুলো তুলনায় নেতিবাচক প্রভাব ও বিস্তার কম; সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর হল ক আবহাওয়ার পরিবর্তন।

Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: সমস্যার লক্ষ্য নির্ধারণ করুন — বাল্যবিবাহ প্রতিরোধ করা, তাই সবচেয়ে কার্যকর প্রথম ধাপ হবে জনমতের পরিবর্তন ও সচেতনতা তৈরির মাধ্যমে মূল কারণগুলো মোকাবিলা করা।  
ধাপ ২: সচেতনতা গ্রহণ করলে পরিবার, স্কুল ও নেতা-সমাজকে তথ্য দিয়ে মনোভাব পরিবর্তন করা সম্ভব হয়; এতে পরে নীতিনির্ধারক বা প্রশাসনের কাছে দাবি তোলাও সহজ হয়।  
ধাপ ৩: অন্য বিকল্পগুলো কেন প্রথমে উপযুক্ত নয় — a (স্থানীয় সরকারকে জানানো) কার্যকর হতে পারে কিন্তু জনসমর্থন না থাকলে টেকসই হবে না; b (বন্ধুদের সঙ্গে আলোচনা) সীমিত প্রভাব রাখে; c (প্রতিবাদ সভা) সচেতনতা ও সমর্থন ছাড়া উত্তেজনা বাড়াতে পারে।

What is the meaning of the proverb, "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime?"

Options:
a. Education is temporary
b. Education has long-lasting effects
c. Food is more important than education
d. Fishing is an easy skill to learn


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish meets an immediate need (short-term help), while teaching to fish gives a person the skill to provide for themselves repeatedly (long-term self-sufficiency).  
Step 2: Compare meanings with the options: this proverb emphasizes the lasting benefit of learning a skill (education or training) rather than a one-time gift.  
Step 3: Therefore the best choice is b: Education has long-lasting effects.  
Explanation why others are incorrect: a is the opposite of the proverb’s point, c incorrectly prioritizes food over learning, and d is irrelevant because the proverb’s focus is on the value of teaching, not the difficulty of fishing.

Why did the King command to educate the bird in "The Parrot's Tale"?

Options:
a. The bird was entertaining
b. The bird needed to be useful
c. The bird was a royal pet
d. The bird was beautiful


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the king’s motive in the story — he wanted the bird to serve a purpose, not merely to look pretty or amuse him.  
Step 2: The command to educate the bird implies training it to be useful (to speak, give information, or perform tasks), so option (b) is the best fit.  
Step 3: Other options are weaker: (a) entertaining and (d) beautiful describe qualities that don't require formal education, and (c) being a royal pet explains ownership but not why the king ordered education. Therefore the correct answer is (b).

b. Helping in community service
c. Watching educational programs
d. Keeping knowledge to oneself


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the question — it asks for a real-life example of applying lessons learned from education, so we look for an option that shows using knowledge in practice.  
Step 2: Evaluate options: option (a) memorizing texts is passive recall, not application; option (c) watching educational programs is learning, not necessarily applying; option (d) keeping knowledge to oneself prevents any application or benefit to others. Option (b) helping in community service clearly uses learned skills/values (e.g., health knowledge, teaching, organizing) to benefit others.  
Step 3: Conclusion — therefore the best real-life example of applying education is option b: helping in community service.

Question:
If you were the King after seeing the bird’s condition, what would you do?

Options:
a. Ignore the bird's needs
b. Find a way to improve its education
c. Build a bigger cage
d. Replace the bird with another


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Observe the bird’s condition and identify the underlying need — it appears neglected or unstimulated, so the priority is care and development rather than punishment or replacement.  
Step 2: Choose an action that addresses that need directly: improving the bird’s education (training, enrichment, social interaction, better care) helps it become healthier and more capable.  
Step 3: Implement and monitor the improvement to ensure long-term wellbeing.

Reasoning: Helping the bird learn and providing enrichment treats the root problem and shows responsible leadership, making option (b) the best choice. The other options are flawed: ignoring it is neglect, building a bigger cage only changes confinement without addressing wellbeing, and replacing the bird avoids responsibility and wastes the chance to improve the existing bird’s life.

Question:
How do the themes of education in 'The Parrot’s Tale' and the role of AI in modern classrooms compare in terms of their impact on learning outcomes?

Options:
a. Both emphasize the importance of personalized learning experiences.
b. Both highlight that excessive focus on structure can hinder true learning.
c. Both suggest that education should prioritize financial gain over student well-being.
d. Both indicate that technology fully replaces the need for traditional teaching methods.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central claims — "The Parrot’s Tale" critiques rigid, overly structured schooling that suppresses curiosity and genuine understanding; discussions about AI in classrooms often warn that algorithmic, one-size-fits-all or overly prescriptive uses of technology can likewise limit creative thinking and deep learning.  
Step 2: Compare impact on learning outcomes — both works therefore emphasize that an excessive focus on structure, rules, or rigid systems (whether traditional pedagogy or inflexible AI-driven practices) tends to hinder true comprehension and critical thinking.  
Step 3: Conclude the best match — this alignment corresponds to option (b): Both highlight that excessive focus on structure can hinder true learning.  

Why other options are incorrect:
- Option (a): AI often supports personalized learning, but "The Parrot’s Tale" is typically a critique of rigid conformity rather than a celebration of personalization, so they don’t both primarily emphasize personalization.  
- Option (c): Prioritizing financial gain is not a shared theme in these contexts.  
- Option (d): Neither source reasonably claims technology fully replaces traditional teaching; the concern is about balance and appropriate use, not total replacement.

c. শুধু গল্প শুনে
d. কোনো শিক্ষা লাভ করেনি


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে প্রশ্ন থেকে টিটো কীভাবে শিক্ষা লাভ করেছিল জানতে হবে — বিকল্প b হল "গান গেয়ে এবং খেলা করে", যা সঠিক। কারণ গান এবং খেলাধুলার মাধ্যমে শিশুরা সক্রিয়ভাবে অভিজ্ঞতা নিয়ে শিখে, স্মৃতি ও সামাজিক দক্ষতা দ্রুত গড়ে ওঠে; তাই টিটোও এইভাবে শিক্ষা নিয়েছে। অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ a শুধুমাত্র বই পাঠকে সীমাবদ্ধ করে (যা টিটো’র পুরো শেখার মাধ্যম নয়), c শুধু গল্প শোনা সম্পূর্ণ ব্যাখ্যা করে না, এবং d স্পষ্টতই মিথ্যা কারণ টিটো কোনো না কোনোভাবে শিক্ষা পেয়েছে।

Question:
كيف يوضح قصص "حكاية الببغاء" و"توتو-تشان: الفتاة الصغيرة عند النافذة" مفهوم التعليم وأهميته في تشكيل سلوك الأطفال والمجتمع؟

Options:
a. كلتا القصتين تعكسان أهمية التعليم التقليدي فقط.
b. تظهر القصتان كيف يمكن أن يؤدي التعليم إلى تحسين سلوك الأطفال ورفع الوعي الاجتماعي.
c. تؤكد القصتان على أن التعليم ليس له تأثير على المجتمع.
d. توضح القصتان أن التعليم يعتمد فقط على المعرفة النظرية دون تطبيق عملي.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
حل:
خطوة 1: تقرأ كلتا القصتين كأمثلة على كيف يؤثر التعليم في تشكيل سلوك الطفل ووعيه الاجتماعي — "حكاية الببغاء" تُبيّن التعلم عبر المثال والحوار وتأثيره على السلوك، و"توتو-تشان" تُظهر أثر بيئة تعليمية تشجّع الفضول والاحترام.  
خطوة 2: بناءً على ذلك، الخيار b هو الصحيح لأنه يصف بدقة أن التعليم يمكن أن يحسّن سلوك الأطفال ويرفع الوعي الاجتماعي.  
ملاحظات سريعة عن الخيارات الأخرى: a خاطئ لأنها تحدد التعليم بالتقليدي فقط؛ c خاطئ لأنها تنفي أي تأثير للتعليم؛ d خاطئ لأنها تتجاهل البُعد العملي والتطبيقي للتعليم.

শিক্ষার প্রধান উদ্দেশ্য __________。

Options:
a. অর্থ উপার্জন করা
b. মানবিকতা উন্নয়ন করা
c. শিক্ষাগত যোগ্যতা অর্জন করা
d. মৌলিক নীতি শিখা


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. শিক্ষার মূল লক্ষ্য হলো ব্যক্তির সামগ্রিক মানবিক উন্নয়ন — নৈতিকতা, দায়িত্ববোধ, সমাজবদ্ধতা ও সহমর্মিতা গড়ে তোলা।  
2. অপশন বিশ্লেষণ করে দেখা যায়, খ "মানবিকতা উন্নয়ন করা" সরাসরি সেই মূল লক্ষ্যকে ব্যাখ্যা করে, তাই এটি সঠিক উত্তর।  
3. অন্য অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ: ক অর্থ উপার্জন করা শিক্ষার একটি পার্শ্বিক ফল, না মূল উদ্দেশ্য; গ শিক্ষাগত যোগ্যতা অর্জন করাই একটি মাধ্যম; ঘ মৌলিক নীতি শেখাও গুরুত্বপূর্ণ তবে তা সামগ্রিক মানবিক উন্নয়নের অংশ মাত্র।

Options:
a. অ্যাকাউন্ট
b. কেজ
c. বই
d. রঙ্গিন পেন্সিল


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নে বলা হয়েছে—পাখির শিক্ষা প্রক্রিয়ার শুরুতে কী দরকার ছিল—এটি পরিপক্ক করার জন্য সাধারণত একটি নিরাপদ জায়গা বা খাঁচা প্রয়োজন হয় যাতে পাখিটিকে নিয়ন্ত্রণ ও পর্যবেক্ষণ করা যায়।  
ধাপ ২: বাকি বিকল্পগুলো পর্যালোচনা করলে—অ্যাকাউন্ট, বই বা রঙিন পেন্সিল শুরুতেই প্রয়োজনীয় সরঞ্জাম নয়; সেগুলো শিখানোর পরবর্তী বা সহায়ক উপকরণ হতে পারে না।

পাখির শিক্ষার সময় শিক্ষক __________ তে মাদক ব্যবহার করেছিলেন।

Options:
a. নাশপতি
b. সিগারেট
c. স্নাফ
d. চিনি


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপে ধাপে বিচার করে দেখা যাক—
Step 1: প্রশ্ন অনুযায়ী শিক্ষকের “মাদক ব্যবহার” ঘটেছে, তাই এমন একটি বিকল্প খুঁজতে হবে যা মাদকদ্রব্য নির্দেশ করে।  
Step 2: বিকল্পগুলো পর্যবেক্ষণ করলে নাশপতি ও চিনি মাদক নয়, সিগারেট ও স্নাফ মাদকজাতীয়। সাধারণ পাঠ্যসূত্রে এই ঘটনার বর্ণনায় বিশেষভাবে উল্লেখ থাকে যে শিক্ষক স্নাফ ব্যবহার করেছিলেন, যা তামাকের একটি ধরন।  
সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: c: স্নাফ।

Options:
a. আকৃতি
b. জল
c. বিভিন্ন লেখার পরীক্ষা
d. সাবধান করা


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: বাক্যটি বিশ্লেষণ করলে "প্রত্যক্ষ করেন" একটি ক্রিয়া, তাই এর পরে এমন একটি বস্তু লাগবে যা দেখা যায়।  
Step 2: বিকল্পগুলো পরীক্ষা করলে ক "আকৃতি" একটি সম্ভাব্য নাম, খ "জল" কাগজে থাকার সম্ভাবনা কম সাধারণ অর্থে, গ "বিভিন্ন লেখার পরীক্ষা" কাগজে সরাসরি দেখা যায় এমন বস্তু এবং ঘ "সাবধান করা" একটি ক্রিয়া যা বাক্যে সামঞ্জস্যহীন।  
Step 3: অর্থগত ও ব্যাকরণগতভাবে কাগজে সরাসরি দেখা যায় এমন বস্তু হিসেবে গ সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো গ।

শিক্ষার একটি প্রাসঙ্গিক প্রবাদ হলো, __________ শেখালে একজনকে সারা জীবনের জন্য খাদ্য সরবরাহ করা যায়।

Options:
a. একটি নাবালককে
b. এক জন মৎস্যজীবীকে
c. একটি খাঁচায়
d. একটি পাখিকে


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: বাক্যটি পরিচিত প্রবাদ থেকে নেওয়া — “কেউকে মাছ খাওয়ালে সে একদিন ভক্ষণ পায়; কারোকে মাছ শিকার করা শেখালে সে সারাজীবন খেতে পারে।”  
ধাপ ২: প্রবাদটির মূল অর্থ হলো কাউকে সরবরাহ না করে তাকে দক্ষতা শেখানো; এভাবে “মৎস্যজীবীকে” শেখানো—অর্থাৎ প্রবিধান অনুযায়ী বিকল্প b (এক জন মৎস্যজীবীকে) সঠিক।  
ধাপ ৩: অন্য বিকল্পগুলি অযৌক্তিক কারণ a (একটি নাবালককে) ও d (একটি পাখিকে) ব্যক্তি/প্রসংগতালিকার সংশোধিত ভাবনা দেয় না, এবং c (একটি খাঁচায়) পুরোপুরি প্রসঙ্গে মিল না করে। তাই সঠিক উত্তর: b।

Question:
How do the themes presented in 'The Parrot's Tale' and the discussions of education technology highlight the necessity of understanding the purpose of education?

Options:
a. Both emphasize that education should focus solely on theoretical knowledge.
b. Both suggest that practical application and engagement in education lead to true learning.
c. Both imply that education is only valuable if it results in monetary gain.
d. Both indicate that education is a fixed process that does not require adaptation.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the common theme: "The Parrot's Tale" criticizes rote, purposeless learning and shows that meaningful learning comes from active, relevant engagement; discussions about education technology likewise stress using tools to make learning practical, interactive, and applied rather than merely theoretical.

Step 2 — Match to options: This shared emphasis on practical application and engagement directly corresponds to option b.

Step 3 — Eliminate other options: (a) conflicts with both texts because they reject focusing solely on theory; (c) is incorrect because neither text reduces education’s value only to monetary gain; (d) is wrong because both promote adaptation and innovation in how education is delivered.

Therefore the correct answer is b.

ধাপ ২: 'The Parrot's Tale'—এর শিক্ষালব্ধ তাৎপর্যও একইভাবে সৃজনশীলতা ও সমর্থনমূলক পরিবেশকে গুরুত্ব দেয়, যার ফলে বোধগম্যতা ও মোটিভেশন বাড়ে।

c. এটি কৃত্রিম বুদ্ধিমত্তার উপর নির্ভর করে।
d. এটি শুধুমাত্র শিক্ষকদের উপর নির্ভর করে।


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নে শিক্ষা সম্পর্কে যে মূল বক্তব্যগুলো রয়েছে তা বিশ্লেষণ করি — শিক্ষা ব্যক্তিগত দক্ষতা, মূল্যবোধ ও সমষ্টিগত উন্নয়ন ঘটায় এবং সমাজে পরিবর্তন আনে।  
ধাপ ২: a বলা যায় সঠিক কারণ এটি সরাসরি উন্নয়ন ও সমাজ পরিবর্তনের কথা বলছে, যা শিক্ষার মৌলিক ভূমিকা।  
ধাপ ৩: বাকী অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ b শুধু জ্ঞানের অর্জনকে সীমাবদ্ধ করে, c শিক্ষা কৃত্রিম বুদ্ধিমত্তার উপর নির্ভরশীল নয়, এবং d শিক্ষা শুধু শিক্ষকের ওপর নির্ভর করে না — শিক্ষার্থী, পরিবার ও সমাজও ভূমিকা রাখে।

Options:
a. পাখিটি কি গান গায়
b. পাখিটি কি তাকে কিছু শেখাতে পারে
c. পাখিটি কি সুন্দর
d. পাখিটি কি উড়ে যেতে পারে


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান: 

1) প্রশ্নটি জিজ্ঞাসা করছে "টোটো পাখির কাছে গিয়ে কি জানতে চেয়েছিল?" — এখানে মূল শব্দটি হচ্ছে "জানতে চেয়েছিল", যা কোনো কাজ বা ক্ষমতা সম্পর্কে জানতে চাওয়া বোঝায়।  
2) দেওয়া অপশনের মধ্যে খ "পাখিটি কি তাকে কিছু শেখাতে পারে" সরাসরি শেখানোর সম্ভাবনা সম্পর্কে জানতে চাওয়া বোঝায়, তাই এটি সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত।  
3) অন্য অপশনগুলো অপ্রাসঙ্গিক: ক গান গাওয়া, গ সুন্দর হওয়া এবং ঘ উড়তে পারা—এসব বিষয়গুলি "জানতে চাওয়া" থেকে পাঠ্যপ্রেক্ষিতে কম প্রাসঙ্গিক।  
সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: b — পাখিটি কি তাকে কিছু শেখাতে পারে।

Question:
What does the proverb "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime" mean?

Options:
a. Teaching is more beneficial than providing temporary help
b. Fishing is the only useful skill to have
c. People should only rely on others for food
d. Fishing is not a valuable skill


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving someone a fish solves an immediate need, while teaching them to fish gives them a lasting skill and independence.  
Step 2: Compare options — option a says teaching is more beneficial than temporary help, which matches the proverb’s meaning.  
Step 3: Conclude and eliminate others — options b, c, and d are literal or opposite misinterpretations (b and d wrongly focus only on fishing as the sole value; c wrongly encourages dependency), so the correct answer is a.

Question:
According to the story of "The Parrot's Tale," what was the main reason the bird could not learn?

Options:
a. The scholars were not qualified
b. The bird was kept in a poor cage
c. The bird was not interested in learning
d. The King did not provide enough resources


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: In the story the primary obstacle was the bird’s environment — it was kept in a poor, cramped cage that prevented it from hearing and practicing what the teachers taught, so it could not learn. This directly points to option (b). Options (a) and (d) are incorrect because the narrative indicates the teachers and the king’s intentions/resources were not the main problem; they attempted to teach and provide for the bird. Option (c) is also incorrect because the bird showed potential interest, but the inadequate cage and surroundings blocked its learning.

How can education impact a person's life in the context of the stories discussed?

Options:
a. By providing temporary solutions to problems
b. By equipping individuals with skills for lifelong success
c. By ensuring everyone gets a job
d. By promoting laziness among learners


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central message in the stories — they show how education changes attitudes, builds abilities, and opens long-term opportunities.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that message: option (b) — "equipping individuals with skills for lifelong success" — directly matches the stories' theme of lasting personal and professional growth.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: (a) is wrong because the stories emphasize lasting change, not temporary fixes; (c) is too absolute — education improves employability but does not guarantee a job for everyone; (d) is incorrect because the stories portray education as motivating and empowering, not promoting laziness.  

Therefore the correct answer is (b).

2. যদি পরামর্শদাতারা তথ্য গোপন বা বিকৃত করে থাকতেন, রাজা সত্যিই অজানা থাকতে পারতেন—এই যুক্তিই ব (He relied too much on his advisors) বিকল্পকে সমর্থন করে।

b. Provide more luxurious living conditions
c. Use only strict methods for discipline
d. Ignore the bird's natural instincts


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) ধাপ ১ — সমস্যা বিশ্লেষণ: শেখানোর সফলতার জন্য প্রথমে পাখির মনস্তাত্ত্বিক এবং প্রাকৃতিক চাহিদা (যোগাযোগ, উৎসাহ, নিরাপত্তা) বুঝতে হবে।  
2) ধাপ ২ — কৌশল নির্ধারণ: ধাপে ধাপে ইতিবাচক পরিবেশ গঠন (প্রশংসা, পুরস্কার, ধৈর্যশীল পুনরাবৃত্তি) শেখানোর জন্য উপযোগী; এতে পাখি শেখার জন্য উদ্বুদ্ধ হয় এবং ভরসা তৈরি হয়।  
3) ধাপ ৩ — সিদ্ধান্ত ও তুলনা: প্রদত্ত বিকল্পগুলোর মধ্যে a এটা নিশ্চিত করে যে শেখার পরিবেশ ইতিবাচক হবে—এটাই সবচেয়ে কার্যকরী। বিকল্প b (আরাম বেশি দেওয়া) শেখাতে সরাসরি সহায়ক নয়, c (শাস্তিমূলক কঠোর পদ্ধতি) ভরসা ও শেখার আগ্রহ নষ্ট করে, এবং d (প্রাকৃতিক প্রবৃত্তি উপেক্ষা) পাখির আচরণকে বোঝা ও নিয়ন্ত্রণ করা কঠিন করে তোলে।  

সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: (a) — Focus on building a positive environment for learning.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: 'The Parrot's Tale'-এ শিক্ষার উপস্থাপনায় মূলত শিখনকে ব্যক্তিগতকৃত, অভিজ্ঞতামূলক এবং শিক্ষার্থীর পরিসরে মানানসই করে তোলার ওপর জোর দেওয়া হয়।  
ধাপ ২: "Education and Technology" নিবন্ধে AI-ভিত্তিক শিক্ষার সুবিধাগুলোর মধ্যে ব্যক্তিগতকরণ (adaptive learning), অনুকূল প্রতিক্রিয়া এবং ছাত্রদরের আলাদা চাহিদা অনুযায়ী উপকরণ সরবরাহের কথা বলা হয়েছে।

Options:
a. The bird was a threat to the kingdom
b. The bird was unhelpful and noisy
c. The bird brought profit to fruiterers
d. The bird was a royal pet


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Step 1: পাঠ্যের তথ্য বিশ্লেষণ — গল্পে বলা আছে যে টিয়াটির কারণে ফলবিক্রেতারা লাভ করত, অর্থাৎ পাখিটি বাজারে আর্থিক উপকার দিচ্ছিল।  
Step 2: সিদ্ধান্তের যুক্তি — রাজা পাখিটিকে শিক্ষিত করার কারণ ছিল সেই আর্থিক উপকার বাড়ানো ও নিয়ন্ত্রণ করা, তাই তিনি এমন ব্যবস্থা নিলেন যাতে পাখিটি ফলবিক্রেতাদের জন্য আরও উপযোগী হয়।  

কেন c সঠিক: এটি সরাসরি পাঠ্যের কারণের সঙ্গে মেলে — পাখিটি ফলবিক্রেতাদের জন্য লাভ বয়ে আনছিল।  
কেন অন্যগুলো ভুল: (a) পাখিটি কোনো হুমকি ছিল না; (b) তা কেবল আওয়াজকারী ও অনুপযোগী ছিল না বরং উপকার করছিল; (d) এটি শুধুই রাজকীয় পোষা প্রাণী হওয়ার কারণে শিক্ষিত করা হয়নি, বরং অর্থনৈতিক কারণে।

How does the story of "The Parrot's Tale" reflect on the theme of education?

Options:
a. Education requires expensive resources
b. Education can sometimes harm rather than help
c. Education only benefits teachers
d. Education is straightforward and easy


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the story's central incident and outcome: in "The Parrot's Tale" the attempts to teach or change the parrot lead to negative consequences for the bird rather than benefit.  
Step 2 — Match that outcome to the choices: option (b) "Education can sometimes harm rather than help" directly matches the story's caution that improper or forced education can cause harm.  
Step 3 — Eliminate the others: (a) expensive resources is not a focus of the tale, (c) education only benefits teachers is contradicted by the parrot being harmed, and (d) education is straightforward and easy is false because the story shows complexity and unintended consequences.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
In your opinion, what would have happened if the King had not realized the bird was suffering? Explain your reasoning.

Options:
a. The bird would have learned many skills
b. The bird would have become a better pet
c. The bird would have died without achieving anything
d. The bird would have escaped the cage


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: ধরে নিচ্ছি রাজা যদি পাখির কষ্ট বুঝে না থাকতেন, তাহলে পাখিকে সাহায্য, প্রেম বা পর্যাপ্ত খাদ্য—কোনোটাই না মিলত।  
Step 2: যতক্ষণ সাহায্য বা উপযুক্ত পরিবেশ নেই, পাখি শিখতে বা ভালো পোষ্য হতে পারে না এবং কষ্টের কারণে তার শারীরিক অবস্থা খারাপ হয়ে যেতে পারে।  
Step 3: তাই সবচেয়ে বাস্তবানুগ ফলাফল হল পাখিটি কোনও অর্জন ছাড়াই মারা যেত—অর্থাৎ বিকল্প c সঠিক।  

কেন অন্যগুলি ভুল: বিকল্প a ও b-এর জন্য প্রশিক্ষণ ও যত্ন দরকার, যা রাজা না বুঝলে পাওয়া সম্ভব নয়; d-এর জন্য পাখির পালানোর সুযোগ প্রয়োজন, কিন্তু অবহেলায় ঢাকা বা বন্দি অবস্থাই থাকার সম্ভাবনা বেশি।

b. Helping others is unimportant.
c. Teaching skills is more beneficial than giving temporary aid.
d. Knowledge cannot be shared.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) প্রবাদটির মূল ভাব বোঝা: প্রবাদটি মানুষকে আপৎকালীন সাময়িক সাহায্যের বদলে স্থায়ী সক্ষমতা বা দক্ষতা শিখিয়ে দেওয়ার উপকারিতা তুলে ধরে — অর্থাৎ কাউকে মাছ ধরতে শেখানো, বরং প্রতিদিন মাছ দেয়ার থেকে বেশি লাভজনক।  
2) বিকল্পগুলোর সঙ্গে মিলিয়ে দেখা: a বলছে শিক্ষার প্রয়োজন নেই (প্রবাদটির বিপরীত), b বলছে অন্যকে সাহায্য অপ্রয়োজনীয় (প্রবাদটি সাহায্যের গুরুত্বকে অস্বীকার করে না), c বলে দক্ষতা শেখানো অস্থায়ী সাহায্যের চেয়ে বেশি লাভবান — যা প্রবাদটির সঠিক সার। d বলছে জ্ঞান বণ্টন সম্ভব নয় (প্রবাদটি ঠিক তার উল্টো বার্তা দেয়)।  
3) উপসংহার: সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর হলো c।

Options:
a. The King
b. The Minister
c. The King's nephews
d. The teachers


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
প্রথম ধাপ: গল্পের বর্ণনা অনুযায়ী পাখিটিকে যারা পড়াশোনা বা ভাষা ও আচরণ শেখায়, তাদের পরিচয় লক্ষ্য করা যায় — তারা রাজপুত্রদের মতো নিকটাত্মীয় চরিত্র ছিল।  
দ্বিতীয় ধাপ: গল্পে স্পষ্টভাবে বলা আছে পাখিটিকে রাজার ভাই বা ভ্রাতৃজাতীয় সন্তানরা (ভাতিজা/ভাগ্নেরা) শেখায়, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল গ (রাজার ভ্রাতৃদ্বারা)।  
কারণ ব্যাখ্যা: রাজা বা মন্ত্রী পাখিটিকে শেখানোর কথা উল্লেখ করা হয়নি এবং শিক্ষকরাও উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে এই কাজ করেনি; তাই বেছে নেওয়া যায় যে সঠিক উত্তরটি গ।

Question:
Why did the bird struggle with learning in the story?

Options:
a. It was too old to learn.
b. It was kept in a poor-quality cage.
c. It refused to eat.
d. It was not interested in knowledge.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the cause given in the story — the bird’s learning was hindered by its environment, specifically being confined in a poor-quality cage that limited its ability to practice and explore.  
Step 2: Match this to the options: option b (“It was kept in a poor-quality cage”) exactly states that cause, so it is correct.  
Step 3: Why the others are incorrect — option a (too old) is not mentioned, option c (refused to eat) is irrelevant to learning in the story, and option d (not interested in knowledge) contradicts the narrative that the bird wanted to learn but was prevented by its cage.  

Correct answer: b.

Options:

b. It shows the importance of proper resources for effective education.
c. Education can be ignored without consequences.
d. Education is only about memorizing texts.

Solution:

Step 2: Match that message to the choices: option b directly corresponds because it highlights the need for proper resources for effective education. Step 3: Explain why others are wrong: option a (education only benefits the wealthy) is too narrow and not implied; option c (education can be ignored without consequences) contradicts the story’s shown consequences; option d (education is only about memorizing texts) reduces education to rote learning, which the tale does not promote. Therefore the correct answer is b.

b. It can lead to decreased interaction with teachers.
c. It is too expensive for all schools.
d. It makes learning less accessible.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: বিবেচনা করুন প্রযুক্তি শিক্ষায় কী ফল ফেলে — এটি পাঠ্যবস্তু সহজলভ্য করে, স্ব-গতি শেখার সুযোগ দেয় এবং শেখার কার্যকারিতা বাড়াতে পারে।  
Step 2: প্রধান সম্ভাব্য নেতিবাচক প্রভাব হলো শিক্ষক-শিক্ষার্থী মধ্যে সরাসরি আন্তঃক্রিয়া কমে যাওয়া, কারণ অনেক সময় শিখন অনলাইনে বা স্বয়ংক্রিয় প্ল্যাটফর্মে চলে যায় — তাই option b সঠিক।  
Step 3: বাকী অপশনগুলো সংক্ষেপে যাচাই: option a ভুল কারণ প্রযুক্তি সবসময় শেখার দক্ষতা বাড়ায় না; option c আংশিক সত্য হতে পারে কিন্তু সব স্কুলে প্রযোজ্য নয়; option d ভুল কারণ সাধারণত প্রযুক্তি শেখাকে আরও সহজলভ্য করে।

Options:
a. To provide temporary help
b. To ensure lifelong skills
c. To entertain children
d. To create competition


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — it contrasts providing a short-term benefit (giving a fish) with teaching a lasting skill (teaching to fish).  
Step 2: Match this meaning to the options: the proverb emphasizes self-sufficiency and lifelong ability, which corresponds to option b.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is b; option a describes the temporary help side, and options c and d are unrelated to the proverb’s message.

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the story detail — in "The Parrot's Tale" the bird learns from the prince’s relatives who take responsibility for its education.  
Step 2: That description matches the description of the royal nephews teaching and training the parrot, so the correct choice is (c) the royal nephews.  
Step 3: The other options are incorrect because the king, the goldsmith, and the commoners are not depicted as the bird’s teachers in the tale.

Options:
a. Because it didn’t sing well
b. Because it lacked knowledge
c. Because it was too loud
d. Because it lived in a cage


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the text we look for the reason the King gave for calling the bird useless. The passage explicitly states the bird was considered useless because it lacked knowledge or useful skills.  
Step 2: Therefore the correct choice is (b) "Because it lacked knowledge."  
Explanation why others are wrong: (a) and (c) refer to the bird's singing quality or loudness, which are not given as the King's reason, and (d) living in a cage is a condition, not the stated cause of being "useless."

How does the story of "The Parrot's Tale" reflect on the theme of education in society?

Options:
a. It shows that education is only for the rich
b. It emphasizes the importance of understanding rather than memorization
c. It proves that education is not necessary
d. It highlights the competition among students


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central message of the story — the parrot’s behavior highlights whether it truly understands what it says or merely repeats words.
Step 2: Compare this message to the options: the story criticizes rote repetition and values comprehension, so it aligns with option b.
Step 3: Eliminate others: option a is false because the tale does not link education to wealth; option c is wrong because the story affirms the value of genuine learning; option d is incorrect because the focus is not on competition but on the quality of learning.

Therefore the correct answer is b: It emphasizes the importance of understanding rather than memorization.

Options:
a. পদ্মা
b. যমুনা
c. মেঘনা
d. সুরমা


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান: 
ধাপ ১: বাংলাদেশে প্রধান নদীগুলো হলো পদ্মা, যমুনা, মেঘনা ও সুরমা; এগুলোর মধ্যে বিস্তৃতি ও গুরুত্বপূর্ণতা বিচার করতে হবে।  
ধাপ ২: পদ্মা গঙ্গার মূল শাখা হিসেবে দেশের মধ্য দিয়ে বৃহৎ প্রবাহ এবং বিস্তৃত জলরাশি নিয়ে যায়, তাই সাধারণভাবে বাংলাদেশে সবচেয়ে বড় নদী হিসেবে ধরা হয়।  
সংক্ষিপ্ত কারণ—যমুনা ও মেঘনা বড় হলেও পদ্মাই দেশের প্রধান ও সর্ববৃহৎ নদী; সুরমা তুলনায় ছোট। অতএব সঠিক উত্তর: a: পদ্মা।

c. সব সময় খেলা করা
d. প্রযুক্তি ব্যবহার করা

Solution:
সমাধান:

ধাপ ২: প্রতিটি বিকল্প মূল্যায়ন করা হলে — a) শুধু পরীক্ষায় ভালো করা: খুবই সীমিত উদ্দেশ্য; c) সব সময় খেলা করা: শিক্ষা নয়, বিনোদনমাত্র; d) প্রযুক্তি ব্যবহার করা: শিক্ষা করার উপায় বা হাতিয়ার, উদ্দেশ্য নয়।  
ধাপ ৩: b) সমাজের উন্নয়ন করা — এটি শিক্ষা দ্বারা অর্জিত জ্ঞান ও নৈতিকতার মাধ্যমে সমাজকে উন্নত করার বিস্তৃত ও স্থায়ী উদ্দেশ্য, তাই এটি সঠিক উত্তর।

ধাপ ২: বিকল্পগুলো বিশ্লেষণ করা যাক — a (শুধুমাত্র গ্রেড পাওয়ার জন্য) অনেকটাই সীমাবদ্ধ উদ্দেশ্য; c (বন্ধুদের সঙ্গে প্রতিযোগিতা করার জন্য) অনুপ্রেরণামূলক হলেও শিক্ষা‑উদ্দেশ্য নয়; d (শিক্ষককে খুশি করার জন্য) পার্শ্বপ্রভাব হতে পারে কিন্তু মূল লক্ষ্য নয়।

Options:
a. গাছকে সুন্দর দেখাতে
b. পোকা ধরার জন্য
c. বৃদ্ধি পেতে
d. ফুল ফুটানোর জন্য


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: গাছের জন্য পানি খাদ্যের দ্রবণ ও পরিবহনে সাহায্য করে, ফটোসিন্থেসিসে অংশ নেয় এবং কোষের ভিতরে টারগর (turgor) চাপ তৈরি করে যা কোষ বিস্তার ও বৃদ্ধি নিশ্চিত করে।  
ধাপ ২: যেহেতু এই সব প্রক্রিয়া সরাসরি গাছের বৃদ্ধি ও জীববৈচিত্র্যের জন্য প্রয়োজন, তাই প্রধান কারণ হলো গাছের বৃদ্ধি—অর্থাৎ উত্তর c সঠিক।  
ধাপ ৩: অন্য অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ: a (শুধু সুন্দর দেখাতে) কেবল ফলস্বরূপ হতে পারে, b (পোকা ধরার জন্য) সম্পর্কহীন, আর d (ফুল ফুটানোর জন্য) আংশিকভাবে সত্য হলেও ফুল ফুটানোও জৈবিক বৃদ্ধির একটি অংশ এবং তার জন্যও পানি দরকার; মূল এবং সাধারণ প্রয়োজন হল বৃদ্ধি।

What is the main message of the proverb, "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"?

Options:
a. Education is not important.
b. Learning how to do things is more valuable than temporary help.
c. People should only rely on others.
d. Fishing is better than farming.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The proverb contrasts short-term aid (giving a fish, feeds for a day) with long-term skill-building (teaching to fish, feeds for a lifetime), so its main message is about self-sufficiency through learning.  
Step 2: Option b ("Learning how to do things is more valuable than temporary help") directly matches that message, so it is correct.  
Step 3: The others are incorrect: option a denies the value of education (opposite of the proverb), option c promotes dependence (contradicts teaching independence), and option d is irrelevant (literal preference for fishing over farming).

Options:
a. The bird could sing beautifully.
b. The bird was a royal pet.
c. The bird was not useful and needed to learn manners.
d. The bird could gather fruits.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) গল্পের ভাবনা অনুযায়ী রাজা পাখিটিকে শেখাতে চেয়েছিল কারণ পাখিটি কাজে লাগছিল না এবং শিষ্টাচারের অভাব ছিল বা ব্যবহারিক কিছু শেখার দরকার ছিল।  
2) তাই রাজা চাইতেন পাখিটিকে উপযোগী ও শিষ্ট করার জন্য শিক্ষা দেওয়া হোক — এই কারণই গ (পাখিটি অনুপযোগী ছিল এবং শিষ্টাচার শিখতে হবে) সঠিক করে তুলে ধরে।  
3) অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ: ক (গান গাইতে পারা) থাকলে শেখানোর দরকার কমই হতো; খ (শুধু রাজপ্রানী হওয়া) নিজে শেখার কারণ নয়; ঘ (ফল তোলা) গল্পের উদ্দেশ্য ও প্রাসঙ্গিক নয়।

Question:
How would you describe the bird's education process in "The Parrot's Tale"?

Options:
a. Effective and beneficial.
b. Expensive and meaningless.
c. Quick and successful.
d. Unnecessary and harmful.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the story’s portrayal — the parrot undergoes schooling that costs a lot but yields no real learning or benefit.  
Step 2: From the narrative evidence (wasted money, lessons that don’t help the bird), the education is best described as expensive and meaningless, so option b is correct.  
Step 3: Why others are wrong: option a (effective and beneficial) contradicts the lack of real learning; option c (quick and successful) is false because the tale emphasizes failure, not rapid success; option d (unnecessary and harmful) overstates harm — the emphasis is on cost and meaninglessness rather than active harm.

Question:
If you want to teach someone a skill, which method is better based on the ideas from the story?

Options:
a. Giving them everything they need.
b. Teaching them how to do it themselves.
c. Ignoring their needs.
d. Doing it for them every time.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — to help someone acquire a skill so they can perform it independently in the future.  
Step 2: Compare options by that goal: teaching them how to do it themselves builds understanding and long-term ability, so it matches the goal best.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options: giving everything (a) creates dependence, ignoring (c) provides no help, and doing it for them every time (d) prevents learning.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: teaching them how to do it themselves.

Question:
Analyze the outcome of the bird's education. What could have been done differently to achieve a better result?

Options:
a. Focus on creating a better cage.
b. Teach the bird with more patience and less pressure.
c. Hire more expensive teachers.
d. Ignore the bird's natural instincts.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — সমস্যা বিশ্লেষণ: পাখিটির শিক্ষার খারাপ ফল সাধারণত অতিরিক্ত চাপ, ধৈর্যের অভাব ও তার প্রাকৃতিক প্রবৃত্তির প্রতি অমনোযোগের কারণে ঘটে।  
Step 2 — বিকল্পগুলি যাচাই: a ভাল খাঁচা তৈরী করা শারীরিক আরাম বাড়ায় কিন্তু আচরণগত শিক্ষা সমস্যার মূল সমাধান নয়; c বেশি দামি শিক্ষক নেওয়া দরকারীয় ফল দেয়া নিশ্চিত করে না; d পাখির স্বাভাবিক প্রবৃত্তি উপেক্ষা করলে পরিস্থিতি আরও খারাপ হবে।  
Step 3 — সিদ্ধান্ত ও কারণ: ধৈর্য ও কম চাপের সঙ্গে শেখালে পাখি আরও সহজে নতুন আচরণ শিখে ও মানিয়ে নেয়, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল (b) Teach the bird with more patience and less pressure.

উক্ত আধানের অর্থ কী?

Options:
a. মানুষকে শিক্ষা দেওয়া
b. মাছ ধরার উপায় শেখানো
c. শুধুমাত্র খাবার দেওয়া
d. জীবনের মূল্য শেখানো


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান: উক্ত প্রচলিত প্রবাদটি "কাউকে একটি মাছ দিলে তুমি তাকে একদিনের খাবার দাও, কিন্তু মাছ ধরতে শেখালে তুমি তাকে সারাজীবন পূর্ণ করে দেবে"—অর্থাৎ এখানে মূল উদ্দেশ্য হলো লোককে স্বনির্ভর করে তোলার জন্য দক্ষতা বা শিক্ষা দেওয়া। তাই সঠিক উত্তর ক মানুষকে শিক্ষা দেওয়া। 

ব্যাখ্যা: খ মাছ ধরার উপায় শেখানো যদি প্রবাদটি নিজে-ই বোঝায় তবে সেটি কেবলই উদাহরণ; মূল ভাবনা হল শিক্ষা/দক্ষতা। গ শুধুমাত্র খাবার দেওয়া অল্পস্থায়ী সমাধান এবং ঘ জীবনের মূল্য শেখানো প্রসঙ্গভেদে সম্পর্কিত হতে পারে, কিন্তু প্রবাদটি বিশেষভাবে দক্ষতা/শিক্ষার ওপর জোর দেয়।

Options:
a. পাখি গান গাইতে পারবে
b. সঠিকভাবে খাবার খেতে পারবে
c. পাখির পরিচর্যা করা সহজ হবে
d. মানুষকে আনন্দ দেবে


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান: ধাপ 1: গল্পের মূল প্রসঙ্গে দেখা যায় যে প্যারটকে শেখানোর প্রধান উদ্দেশ্য ছিল পাখিটিকে কথা বলা বা গান শিখিয়ে দক্ষ করা—এটাই গল্পে উৎসর্গ করা শিক্ষা। ধাপ 2: তাই সরাসরি গান/কথা শেখার কথাটি যে বিকল্পে আছে সেইটি সঠিক; তা হলো a: পাখি গান গাইতে পারবে। ব্যাখ্যা: বাকি বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ (b) খাবার খাওয়ার সঠিকতা শেখানো ছিল না, (c) পরিচর্যা সহজ হওয়া গল্পের মূল লক্ষ্য নয়, এবং (d) যদিও গান মানুষের আনন্দ দেয়, গল্পটিতে মূল জোর ছিল পাখির শিক্ষায়, না শুধুমাত্র বিনোদনে।

Options:
a. কাজের ক্ষেত্রে শৃঙ্খলা বজায় রাখা
b. শাসককে হত্যা করা
c. মানুষের মতামত উপেক্ষা করা
d. শুধুমাত্র পরীক্ষায় ভালো ফল অর্জন করা


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে লক্ষ্য নির্ধারণ করতে হবে—শিক্ষার উদ্দেশ্য হলো ব্যক্তি ও সমাজ দুটির উন্নতি করা; এর জন্য নিয়মনীতি, শৃঙ্খলা ও নৈতিক মূল্যবোধ জরুরি। কাজের ক্ষেত্রে শৃঙ্খলা বজায় রাখা (সঠিক উত্তর: a) শিক্ষা প্রাপ্ত মানুষকে দায়শীল, কর্মঠ ও সামাজিক নিয়ম মেনে চলতে শেখায়, ফলে সমাজে উৎপাদনশীলতা ও সহমানবিকতা বাড়ে। বাকী অপশনগুলো (b, c, d) সমাজ উন্নয়নের লক্ষ্যের সঙ্গে সংগতিপূর্ণ নয়: শাসককে হত্যা করা নীতি-বিরোধী ও অবৈধ, মানুষের মতামত উপেক্ষা করা গণতন্ত্র ও সৌহার্দ্যকে ক্ষুন্ন করে, এবং শুধুমাত্র পরীক্ষায় ভালো ফল অর্জন করা সামাজিক উন্নতির সুষম উপায় নয় কারণ তা নৈতিকতা ও দায়িত্বশীলতা নিশ্চিত করে না।

b. সবার জন্য সমান সুযোগ নিশ্চিত করা
c. কেবলমাত্র পুঁথিগত বিদ্যা অর্জন করা
d. শিক্ষার জন্য অর্থ ব্যয় করা


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নে "শিক্ষার গুরুত্ব" কীভাবে আলোচনা করা যায় তা বিশ্লেষণ করতে হবে — শিক্ষা ব্যক্তির ক্ষমতায়ন, সামাজিক ন্যায় ও অর্থনৈতিক উন্নয়নের দিকে নিয়ে যায়।  
ধাপ ২: দেওয়া বিকল্পগুলি মূল্যায়ন করলে দেখা যায় যে বিকল্প (b) "সবার জন্য সমান সুযোগ নিশ্চিত করা" ঠিকভাবে শিক্ষার মূল উদ্দেশ্য ও সামাজিক গুরুত্ব তুলে ধরে।  
অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলির সীমাবদ্ধতা: (a) শাসন নিশ্চিত করা শিক্ষা নয় বরং প্রশাসনের কাজ; (c) শুধু পুঁথিগত বিদ্যা গ্রহণ করলে শিক্ষা নৈতিক, দক্ষতা ও বাস্তবজ্ঞানহীন হবে; (d) অর্থ ব্যয় করা কেবল একটি উপায়, শিক্ষার নিজস্ব গুরুত্ব নয়।

Question:
What is the main idea of the proverb, "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime?"

Options:
a. Learning to fish is difficult.
b. Education is more valuable than temporary help.
c. It's better to give than to teach.
d. Fishing is a waste of time.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish meets an immediate need once, while teaching to fish gives a lasting skill that enables self-sufficiency.  
Step 2: Match meanings to options — option b ("Education is more valuable than temporary help") directly captures the contrast between short-term aid and long-term empowerment.  
Step 3: Eliminate others — option a is about difficulty (not the main idea), option c contradicts the proverb (it favors giving over teaching), and option d is irrelevant.

c. By focusing only on examinations.
d. By relying solely on foreign aid.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. প্রথমে প্রশ্নে লক্ষ্য করা যায় যে উদ্দেশ্য হলো একটি সমুদায় (community) কীভাবে উন্নত করা যায় — তাই শিক্ষার প্রায়োগিক ও সামাজিক দিকগুলো বিবেচনা করতে হবে।
2. (b) সঠিক কারণ শিক্ষা যদি মানুষকে একসঙ্গে সমস্যা সমাধান করতে শেখায় তাহলে তারা স্বাস্থ্য, পরিবেশ, ব্যবসা ইত্যাদি ক্ষেত্রে স্থানীয় সমস্যা চিহ্নিত করে মিলিতভাবে টেকসই সমাধান তৈরি করতে পারবে; এটি দক্ষতা বৃদ্ধি, স্থানীয় নেতৃত্ব ও সামাজিক সংহতি গড়ে তোলে।

Question:
Compare the effects of traditional education and modern educational methods on students' learning outcomes.

Options:
a. Traditional education is always better.
b. Modern methods confuse students.
c. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.
d. Only modern methods are effective.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify criteria for “learning outcomes” — e.g., knowledge retention, critical thinking, engagement, and practical skills.  
Step 2: Compare methods against these criteria: traditional education often gives clear structure, strong foundations, and discipline; modern methods (active learning, technology, project-based) often boost engagement, problem-solving and adaptability.  
Step 3: Conclude by balancing pros and cons: because each approach strengthens different aspects of learning, the best assessment is that both have advantages and disadvantages, so option (c) is correct.  

Why other options are incorrect:
- a is wrong because traditional methods are not always superior for skills like creativity or collaboration.  
- b is wrong because modern methods do not inherently confuse students; when well-designed they enhance understanding.  
- d is wrong because modern methods are not universally more effective in every context; some subjects or learners benefit from traditional approaches.

What is the main purpose of education according to the proverb, "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"?

Options:
a. To provide temporary relief
b. To impart skills for lifelong independence
c. To ensure everyone has access to fish
d. To make people rich


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish solves an immediate need (short-term help), while teaching to fish gives a person a skill to provide for themselves indefinitely (long-term self-reliance).  
Step 2: Match interpretations to options: b ("To impart skills for lifelong independence") directly corresponds to the long-term, skill-building meaning of the proverb, so it is correct.  
Step 3: Why others are incorrect — a describes only the short-term part of the proverb, c wrongly focuses on access to fish rather than teaching a skill, and d mistakenly infers making people rich, which the proverb does not claim.

Options:
a. Because the bird was a royal pet
b. Because the bird was unlettered and lacked manners
c. Because the bird brought joy to the kingdom
d. Because the bird could sing well


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the reason given in the story — the king ordered the bird to be educated because the parrot was unlettered and lacked manners, so it needed instruction to behave and speak properly.  
Step 2: Match this to the options: option b directly states "Because the bird was unlettered and lacked manners," which fits the motive in the tale.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a (just a royal pet) and option c (brought joy) would not explain why the king insisted on education, and option d (could sing well) contradicts the need for schooling.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Step 1: Identify the meaning of "civic engagement" — involvement by individuals in community or public activities aimed at improving society and supporting democratic life.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that definition: option b ("Participating in community activities for improvement") directly matches the definition; option a (attending classes) is personal/academic, option c (volunteering only when necessary) implies limited or occasional participation rather than ongoing engagement, and option d (focusing solely on personal achievements) is not community-oriented.

b. By providing knowledge on environmental care
c. By focusing only on academic success
d. By asking the government to solve it


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — solving a local problem (river pollution) requires knowledge, skills and community action.  
Step 2: Evaluate each option: option b teaches environmental care which gives people practical knowledge (e.g., waste disposal, water protection, advocacy) to prevent and reduce pollution.  
Step 3: Conclude that educating children and community members builds long-term behavior change and local capacity, so option b is correct.

Explanation of wrong options: a encourages ignoring the problem (counterproductive), c limits focus to academics without practical environmental action, and d shifts responsibility solely to government rather than empowering local solutions.

2. ধাপ ২: প্রতীকী অর্থ নির্ণয় — খাঁচা here represents appearance vs. reality: শোভা থাকা সত্ত্বেও তা শেখার প্রকৃত উদ্দেশ্যকে বাধাগ্রস্ত করে; hence it symbolizes the confinement of true learning.  
3. ধাপ ৩: বিকল্পগুলোর তুলনা — (a) সৌন্দর্য বোঝায় না কারণ খাঁচার সৌন্দর্য শিখনের মুক্তিকে প্রতিস্থাপন করে; (c) বিলাসিতার গুরুত্ব নয় কারণ বিলাসিতা এখানে শিকড়ে বাধা দেয়; (d) গঠন আবশ্যকতা বোঝায় না কারণ খাঁচা গঠন না করে নিপীড়ন সৃষ্টি করে।

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the king’s purpose — he wants the bird to learn and change its ways, so it behaves properly.  
Step 2: The phrase “educate the bird” implies correcting its conduct or speech, not merely keeping or showing it. That matches option b (to improve the bird’s behavior).  
Why the others are wrong: option a (he likes birds) explains affection but not the motive to educate; option c (to display it in the palace) would involve exhibiting rather than teaching; option d (to entertain the court) suggests using the bird for amusement, not reform. Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
How can we apply the lesson of "The Parrot's Tale" in our lives?

Options:
a. By teaching others practical skills
b. By ignoring others' needs
c. By focusing only on exams
d. By buying expensive things


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the story's lesson — "The Parrot's Tale" emphasizes sharing knowledge, helping others, and using one's abilities for others' benefit.  
Step 2: Match this lesson to the options: option a (By teaching others practical skills) directly reflects sharing useful knowledge and helping people.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: option b (ignoring others' needs) contradicts the story's theme, option c (focusing only on exams) is too narrow and self-centered, and option d (buying expensive things) is unrelated to moral lessons about helping and teaching.  
Therefore the correct answer is a.

Question:
Compare the King's actions and the bird's situation. What does this reflect about the theme of education?

Options:
a. The King cares for the bird
b. Education is about appearances
c. True education involves understanding
d. Birds cannot be educated


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Compare the two: the King's actions are outward, authoritative measures (showing control or appearance), while the bird's situation reveals lack of inner learning or understanding.  
Step 2: Conclude that the theme emphasizes inner comprehension rather than mere external display—true education means understanding, not just appearances or force.  
Therefore the correct choice is c (True education involves understanding).  
Why others are wrong: a is false because the King’s behavior is not genuine care; b is incorrect because the comparison criticizes superficial appearance as insufficient; d is irrelevant and exaggerated—being a bird is not the point, but the presence or absence of real understanding is.

Question:
If you were to make changes to the bird's education, what would you prioritize?

Options:
a. More luxurious cages
b. Practical skills and freedom
c. More texts and lessons
d. Opinions of the goldsmith


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the underlying goal — improving the bird’s education means giving it skills and opportunities to behave and live better, not just material comfort or irrelevant advice.  
Step 2: Compare options: option b emphasizes practical skills and freedom, which directly improve the bird’s capabilities and well‑being; option a (more luxurious cages) only changes environment comfort, option c (more texts and lessons) is overly theoretical and may not translate to real abilities, and option d (opinions of the goldsmith) is irrelevant.  
Conclusion: therefore option b is the best choice because it most directly advances meaningful education for the bird.

b. মানুষের উন্নতির জন্য কাজ করা
c. সকলকে একইভাবে শিক্ষিত করা
d. সহজে টাকা উপার্জন করা


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) শিক্ষার মূল লক্ষ্য হলো ব্যক্তিগত, বৌদ্ধিক, নৈতিক ও সামাজিক উন্নয়ন নিশ্চিত করা—অর্থাৎ মানুষের সার্বিক উন্নতির জন্য কাজ করা।  
2) তাই বিকল্প b ("মানুষের উন্নতির জন্য কাজ করা") সঠিক, কারণ এটি শিক্ষার বিস্তৃত ও স্থায়ী উদ্দেশ্যকে নির্দেশ করে।  
3) অন্যগুলো ভুল কেন: a শুধুমাত্র পরীক্ষায় ভালো ফলকে কেন্দ্রীভূত করে (অতিসংকী), c সকলকে একইভাবে শিক্ষিত করা বাস্তবে লক্ষ্য নয় (সমতার সঙ্গে প্রকৃত প্রয়োজন ও সক্ষমতার ভিন্নতা বিবেচ্য), এবং d সহজে টাকা উপার্জন করা শিক্ষার প্রধান উদ্দেশ্য নয় (এটি কেবল একটি আংশিক উপকার)।

যদি আপনি আপনার গ্রামে বন্যার কারণে সমস্যা দেখতে পান, তাহলে আপনি কী করবেন?

Options:
a. কিছু না করা
b. স্থানীয় প্রশাসনের কাছে অভিযোগ জানানো
c. বন্ধুদের সাথে খেলা করা
d. টিভিতে খবর দেখা


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: সমস্যা বিশ্লেষণ—বন্যা মানে জীবনের নিরাপত্তা, জনস্বাস্থ্য ও সম্পত্তির ঝুঁকি; তাই তাৎক্ষণিক সমাধান ও প্রশাসনিক সহায়তা প্রয়োজন।  
ধাপ ২: বিকল্পগুলোর তুলনা—করণীয় হিসাবে ব (স্থানীয় প্রশাসনের কাছে অভিযোগ জানানো) সরাসরি সাহায্য ও তৎপরতা জোরদার করে; অপর বিকল্পগুলো কাজটি সমাধান করে না।  
ধাপ ৩: সিদ্ধান্ত—অতএব কার্যকর ও দায়িত্বশীল পদক্ষেপ হিসেবে সঠিক উত্তর হল (b) স্থানীয় প্রশাসনের কাছে অভিযোগ জানানো।  

অন্যগুলোর কেন ভুল: (a) কিছু না করা সমস্যা বাড়ায়; (c) বন্ধুদের সাথে খেলা করা অপ্রাসঙ্গিক; (d) টিভি দেখলে তথ্য মিলবে কিন্তু তাৎক্ষণিক সহায়তা/কার্যকর ব্যবস্থা নেয়া যাবে না।

b. বনভূমি প্রাণী ও উদ্ভিদের আবাসস্থল
c. বনভূমি আমাদের খাবার দেয়
d. সবগুলিই সঠিক


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রতিটি বিকল্প আলাদাভাবে যাচাই করা যাক — 
ক বনভূমি শুধু সুন্দর লাগে — এটি একটি সত্য বিবরণ হতে পারে কিন্তু অসম্পূর্ণ, কারণ বনভূমির কার্যকারিতা কেবল সৌন্দর্যেই সীমাবদ্ধ নয়।  
খ বনভূমি প্রাণী ও উদ্ভিদের আবাসস্থল — এটি সঠিক; বনভূমি অনেক প্রজাতির জন্য আবাস ও বাসস্থান সরবরাহ করে।  
গ বনভূমি আমাদের খাবার দেয় — এটি সঠিকও; বনজাত ফল, বাদাম, শিকারের মাধ্যমে মানুষ ও সমাজের খাদ্যসূত্র আসে।  

ধাপ ২: উপসংহার — যেহেতু খ ও গ উভয়ই সঠিক এবং ক কিছুদূর পর্যন্ত সত্য হলেও অসম্পূর্ণ, তাই সবগুলোই মিলিয়ে বনভূমির গুরুত্ব পূর্ণরূপে ব্যাখ্যা করে। অতএব সঠিক উত্তর: ঘ (সবগুলিই সঠিক)।

Options:
a. ধৈর্য কোনো ফল দেয় না
b. সফল হওয়ার জন্য শুধু চেষ্টা করা দরকার
c. ধৈর্য একটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ গুণ
d. সফলতা আরামদায়ক


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রবাদটির দুটি অংশ বিশ্লেষণ করলে দেখা যায় — "ধৈর্য রাখো" মানে ধৈর্য ধারণ করা এবং "তবে সফল হও" মানে ধৈর্যের ফলে সফলতা পাওয়া।  
ধাপ ২: এ থেকে সরাসরি বোঝায় যে এখানে ধৈর্যকে সফলতার একটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ গুণ হিসেবে তুলে ধরা হচ্ছে, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে c।  
অন্যগুলোর কারণ ভুল: a প্রবন্ধটির বিপরীত বলেছে, b অসম্পূর্ণ কারণ কেবল চেষ্টা নয়—ধৈর্যও দরকার বলা হয়েছে, আর d প্রবাদে সফলতাকে আরামদায়ক হিসেবে উল্লেখ নেই।

b. মানুষের চিন্তাভাবনা ও আচরণ পরিবর্তিত হয়
c. কেবল অর্থনৈতিক উন্নতি
d. শিক্ষার কোনো গুরুত্ব নেই


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: প্রশ্ন বিশ্লেষণ করে বুঝতে হবে শিক্ষার প্রধান প্রভাব কী — কি ধরনের পরিবর্তন সমাজে আসে।  
Step 2: শিক্ষা মানুষকে জ্ঞান, মূল্যবোধ, সমালোচনামূলক চিন্তা ও সামাজিক নীতি শেখায়, ফলে ব্যক্তির মনোভাব ও আচরণ বদলায়; তাই শিক্ষার মাধ্যমে সামাজিক মানসিকতা ও আচরণগত পরিবর্তন ঘটে।  
Step 3: অপশনগুলির মূল্যায়ন—a ও c অংশগুলো (কেবল প্রযুক্তিগত বা কেবল অর্থনৈতিক উন্নতি) আংশিক ফল নির্দেশ করে, কিন্তু সম্পূর্ণ নয়; d পুরোপুরি ভুল বক্তব্য।

b. Short-term help is better than long-term education.
c. Education provides lifelong benefits.
d. Skills are unnecessary for success.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:

Step 2: Match that idea to the choices: option (c) "Education provides lifelong benefits" directly states this lasting value, so it is correct.  
Why others are wrong: (a) focuses on teaching versus learning, which is not the proverb's point; (b) claims short-term help is better than long-term education, which contradicts the proverb; (d) says skills are unnecessary, which is unrelated and incorrect.

Why did the King decide to educate the bird in "The Parrot's Tale?"

Options:
a. He wanted the bird to sing better.
b. He believed the bird could bring profits.
c. He thought all birds should be educated.
d. He was bored and wanted a project.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the king’s motive in the story — he trained the parrot not merely for amusement but because he expected a practical return (the text states he thought the bird could be useful/bring benefits).  
Step 2: Match that motive to the options: option b ("He believed the bird could bring profits") directly reflects a practical, profit-oriented motive.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a (singing better) and option c (all birds should be educated) are general or aesthetic reasons not supported by the king’s pragmatic intent, and option d (boredom) contradicts the story’s explicit suggestion of expected gain.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

d. By relying on others for knowledge.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: স্তুতিটি চিনে নিন — "The Parrot's Tale" থেকে মূল শিক্ষা হলো সত্যিকারের, অর্থপূর্ণ শেখাকে মূল্য দেওয়া, কেবল বাহ্যিক নকল নয়।  
Step 2: প্রয়োগ করুন — এই শিক্ষা আপনার জীবনে মেনে চলুন: বুঝে শেখা, প্রশ্ন করা এবং বাস্তবে প্রয়োগ করা; এটি সরাসরি c (By valuing meaningful learning)‑এর সঙ্গে মিলে যায়।

Which of the following describes the character of the King in "The Parrot's Tale"?

Options:
a. Indifferent and lazy.
b. Wise but naive.
c. Cruel and selfish.
d. Generous and understanding.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the tale, the king makes sensible decisions and understands matters of state, showing clear intelligence and judgment.  
Step 2: At the same time he is easily misled by appearances and believes what he is told without full scrutiny, which is a sign of naivety.  
Step 3: Comparing this to the choices, option (b) "Wise but naive" exactly matches both qualities; (a) is wrong because he is not shown as indifferent or lazy, (c) is wrong because he is not depicted as cruel or selfish, and (d) is incorrect because although he has good intentions, his naivety rather than deep understanding is emphasized.

Evaluate the effectiveness of the education methods used for the bird. What could be improved?

Options:
a. More focus on practical lessons.
b. Ignore the bird’s needs.
c. Invest in better cages only.
d. Increase the number of teachers.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — improve the bird’s learning outcomes by examining which method most directly enhances skill acquisition and behavior.  
Step 2: Reasoning — practical lessons (hands-on training, demonstrations and reinforcement) give the bird direct practice, faster feedback and better retention, so they most effectively change behavior and skills.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices — ignoring the bird’s needs is harmful and counterproductive; buying better cages helps environment but not learning; more teachers only helps if current instruction is insufficient, but does not substitute for practical, applied training.  
Therefore the best answer is (a) More focus on practical lessons.

Options:
a. It was too small.
b. It was made of straw and twigs.
c. The bird did not want to learn.
d. It was always noisy.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
The scholars reasoned that the nest's construction—being made of straw and twigs—provided an inadequate, flimsy environment that failed to support proper growth and learning, so option b is correct. Step-by-step: (1) identify the cause cited by scholars (the nest's material), (2) interpret how weak, makeshift materials imply a poor upbringing or unsuitable conditions for learning, (3) conclude that this explains the bird's ignorance. Other options are incorrect because a (size) does not explain ignorance by itself, c (the bird's unwillingness) blames the bird rather than its environment, and d (noise) is irrelevant to the described cause.

Options:
a. It shows that education is not necessary.
b. It highlights the negative aspects of rules.
c. It illustrates that education can be mismanaged.
d. It indicates that singing is more important than education.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Read the story for its central message about teaching and outcomes. The Parrot's Tale shows that the parrot’s training and lessons were mishandled or inadequate, leading to confusion or harm; this demonstrates that education can be mismanaged, so option c is correct. Options a (education not necessary) and d (singing more important than education) contradict the story’s emphasis on teaching, and option b (highlights the negative aspects of rules) misreads the focus—the problem is poor instruction, not rules themselves. Therefore the best answer is c.

Options:
a. Change the teachers.
b. Provide more resources for education.
c. Release the bird back into the wild.
d. Ignore the problem.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
1) Identify the root problem: the bird’s poor condition suggests a systemic lack of support (resources, care, environment), not just a single failing person.  
2) Choose the action that addresses the root cause: providing more resources for education (option b) improves facilities, training, and ongoing care, producing a lasting improvement.  
3) Why others are less suitable: changing the teachers (option a) might help but won’t fix material or structural shortages; releasing the bird (option c) ignores the need for rehabilitation first; ignoring (option d) makes the problem worse. Therefore the best choice is option b.

Step 2: Compare options: option a provides paper and colored pencils/markers, which directly support making illustrated themes, so it fits the activity.  
Step 3: Other options are less suitable: option b (simple props) could help with role-play but not with drawing; option c (paper, pens) lacks color tools for illustrations; option d is incorrect because materials are required. Therefore the correct answer is a.

Step 2: Compare these aims with the options: option (c) "Improved understanding of character perspectives; development of teamwork and presentation skills" directly matches the core functions of role play.  
Step 3: Eliminate others: (a) focuses on speaking/listening and creativity but misses character perspective and presentation emphasis; (b) stresses themes and artistic expression, which suits drama or art more than role play specifically; (d) emphasises writing and personal connections, which are not primary outcomes of role playing.

Step 1: Read the task requirement — a "Reflection Writing" activity asks for students' personal thoughts or feelings about a topic.  
Step 2: Compare options: option a asks for a short personal paragraph about what education means, which fits a reflective task; options b and d ask for dramatized retellings (a scene or a skit) and option c asks for a debate-style argument, none of which are personal reflections.  
Conclusion: therefore the correct answer is a, because it directly matches the purpose of a reflection writing activity.

Question:
What is the objective of the Education Debate activity?

Options:
a. To enhance listening and speaking skills through storytelling.
b. To engage students in critical thinking about education methods.
c. To explore the themes of education depicted in 'The Parrot's Tale.'
d. To encourage personal reflection on educational values.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the core aim of a debate activity — debates are designed to make participants analyze positions, weigh evidence, and argue for or against methods or ideas, which is critical thinking about the topic.
Step 2: Compare options: option (b) directly states engaging students in critical thinking about education methods, matching the debate aim; option (a) (listening and speaking through storytelling) describes a storytelling exercise, not a debate; option (c) focuses on one story’s themes, which is too specific; option (d) (personal reflection) may be a byproduct but is not the primary objective of a debate.
Conclusion: Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Options:
a. কারণ এটি গান গায়
b. কারণ এটি রাজাকে খুশি করার জন্য
c. কারণ এটি অশিক্ষিত ছিল
d. কারণ এটি খাদ্য খায়


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: প্রশ্নটি বোঝা — প্রশ্ন জিজ্ঞাসা করছে রাজা কেন প্যারোটকে শিক্ষিত করতে চাইছিলেন। দেওয়া সঠিক উত্তর হলো (c) কারণ এটি অশিক্ষিত ছিল।

Step 2: বিশ্লেষণ — যদি প্যারোট অশিক্ষিত থাকে, রাজা তাকে শিক্ষিত করার منطقی কারণ আছে যাতে সে শিখতে পারে। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো অপ্রাসঙ্গিক: (a) গান গাওয়া এবং (d) খাদ্য খাওয়া শেখানোর কারণ নয়, এবং (b) “রাজাকে খুশি করার জন্য” হতে পারে একটি লক্ষ্য় কিন্তু প্রশ্নে সরাসরি প্রদত্ত কারণ হিসেবে অশিক্ষিত থাকা (c) সবচেয়ে স্পষ্ট এবং যুক্তিযukt। 

অতএব সঠিক উত্তর: c।

শিক্ষার মূল উদ্দেশ্য কী?

Options:
a. সার্টিফিকেট অর্জন করা
b. জীবনের পরিবর্তন আনা
c. রাজা ও রাজ্যের সেবা করা
d. প্যারোটকে খাঁচায় রাখা


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: শিক্ষার মূল লক্ষ্য হলো মানুষের জ্ঞান, দক্ষতা, মূল্যবোধ ও বিচারশক্তি উন্নয়ন করে তার জীবনমান ও সমাজে ইতিবাচক পরিবর্তন সাধন করা।  
ধাপ ২: বিবেচনা করে দেখা যায়—a (সার্টিফিকেট অর্জন করা) কেবল একটি ফলাফল বা স্বীকৃতি, কিন্তু মূল উদ্দেশ্য নয়; c (রাজা ও রাজ্যের সেবা করা) খুব সংকীর্ণ ও ঐতিহাসিক ভাবনা; d (প্যারোটকে খাঁচায় রাখা) শিক্ষার সাথে সম্পর্কহীন ও অবান্তর।  
ধাপ ৩: তাই জীবনের পরিবর্তন আনা—অর্থাৎ নির্বাচিত বিকল্প b—হল সঠিক উত্তর, কারণ এটি শিক্ষার সার্বিক উদ্দেশ্যকে সঠিকভাবে ধারণ করে।  
সঠিক উত্তর: b.

Options:
a. শিক্ষকদের নিয়োগ
b. একটি সুন্দর খাঁচা তৈরি
c. খাবার দেওয়া
d. গান শেখানো


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপে ধাপে বিশ্লেষণ:
1) প্রশ্নের বিবরণ থেকে দেখা যায় গল্পে প্রথমেই প্যারোটের জন্য নিরাপদ ও আরামদায়ক পরিবেশ整 করার কাজ করা হয়েছে — মানে প্রথম কাজ ছিল একটি সুন্দর খাঁচা তৈরি করা।  
2) এই প্রস্তুতি হলো পরবর্তী পদক্ষেপগুলোর (খাদ্য চালানো ও গান শেখানো) পূর্বশর্ত, তাই প্রথমেই খাঁচা তৈরি করা যৌক্তিক।  
3) অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে b: একটি সুন্দর খাঁচা তৈরি। অন্যগুলো ভুল কারণ (a) শিক্ষকের নিয়োগ, (c) খাবার দেওয়া এবং (d) গান শেখানো সবই সাধারণত খাঁচা তৈরি করার পরের ধাপ।

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান: শিক্ষকরা প্যারোটকে শিক্ষিত করার জন্য বিভিন্ন পাঠ্যবই পাঠিয়েছেন, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো b: বিভিন্ন পাঠ্যবই পাঠিয়ে। কারণ প্রশ্নে বলা হয়েছে তারা প্যারোটকে শেখানোর চেষ্টা করেছে পাঠ্যবই পাঠিয়ে — এটি সরাসরি বর্ণিত পদ্ধতি। অপর বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ গান শেখানো বা খাঁচায় আবদ্ধ করা বা হাতে লিখিত পাঠ্য দেওয়ার উল্লেখ প্রশ্নে নেই বা প্রাসঙ্গিক নয়।

b. প্রকৃত জীবন থেকে শিখিয়ে
c. খাঁচায় রেখে

প্যারোট সাধারণত অনুকরণ করে, বাস্তব জীবনের আচরণ ও শব্দ থেকে শেখে এবং সামাজিক যোগাযোগে ভালোভাবে প্রতিক্রিয়া দেয়—এগুলো চিন্তা করে ধাপে ধাপে সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়া যায়। প্রথমে প্যারোটের শেখার ধরণ শনাক্ত করে বাস্তব পরিস্থিতিতে দেখিয়ে, প্রতিমূহুর্তে পুরস্কার বা ইতিবাচক উৎসাহ দিয়ে অনুশীলন করানো কার্যকর। তাই সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত বিকল্প হল খ (প্রকৃত জীবন থেকে শিখিয়ে)। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ ক শুধুমাত্র বই পড়ানো প্যারোটের জন্য অত্যন্ত নৈর্ব্যক্তিক, গ খাঁচায় রেখে শেখানো সীমাবদ্ধ ও অতিরিক্ত মনস্তাত্ত্বিক চাপ সৃষ্টি করে, আর ঘ গান গাওয়ানো সহায়ক হতে পারে কিন্তু একা পর্যাপ্ত নয়।

Question:
What does the proverb 'Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime' mean in the context of education?

Options:
a. Providing immediate help is more important than teaching skills.
b. Education is about long-term learning and independence.
c. People should only learn what is necessary for survival.
d. Fishing is the best profession one can have.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish meets an immediate need (short-term help), while teaching to fish builds a lasting skill (long-term self-sufficiency).  
Step 2: In an educational context this emphasizes teaching skills and knowledge so learners can sustain themselves independently over time.  
Therefore the correct choice is b: Education is about long-term learning and independence.  
Other options are wrong because (a) prioritizes immediate help over skill-building, (c) narrows education to mere survival skills, and (d) takes the proverb literally rather than metaphorically.

Options:
a. The King
b. The Minister
c. The Parrot
d. The Goldsmith


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the focal figure — the title "The Parrot’s Tale" and the narrative structure indicate the story revolves around the parrot as the narrator and central agent.  
Step 2: Confirm by recalling the plot: the parrot tells events, interacts with other characters, and drives the moral/lesson, so the parrot is the protagonist.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: the King, the Minister, and the Goldsmith are secondary characters who appear in relation to the parrot’s actions.

b. The King wanted the bird to sing better.
c. The bird’s ignorance was seen as a loss to the kingdom.
d. Educating the bird was a challenge for the scholars.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: গল্পের বিবরণ থেকে দেখা যায় রাজা পাখিটির ওপর গুণা-অজ্ঞতা (ignorance) কে শুধু ব্যক্তিগত না করে সাম্রাজ্যের ক্ষতি হিসেবে গ্রহণ করেছিলেন।  
Step 2: তাই রাজা পাখিটিকে শিক্ষিত করাতে চেয়েছিলেন যাতে তার অজ্ঞতা রাজ্যের জন্য ক্ষতির কারণ না হয় এবং সামগ্রিকভাবে রাজ্যের মঙ্গলের জন্য শিক্ষা লাভ ঘটুক।  
উপসংহার: সেহেতু সঠিক উত্তর হলো (c) — "The bird’s ignorance was seen as a loss to the kingdom."  
অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলোর সঙ্গততা সংক্ষেপে: (a) পাখিটি বিনোদনমূলক হওয়া ছিল প্রধান কারণ নয়, (b) কেবল গান শেখানোর উদ্দেশ্য গল্পে উল্লেখ নেই, (d) এটি শাস্ত্রবিদদের জন্য চ্যালেঞ্জ হিসেবে দেখানো হয়নি।

How can education help improve the community you live in?

Options:
a. By ensuring everyone gets high grades.
b. By teaching people skills they can use to help others.
c. By making sure all children go to schools.
d. By focusing only on academic knowledge.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Determine what actually improves a community — not just test scores, but people’s ability to solve problems, work together, and help others.  
Step 2: Compare the options: option b talks about teaching useful skills, which directly enables people to contribute (vocational skills, civic awareness, communication, problem-solving).  
Step 3: Conclude that option b is best because skills learned through education can be applied to meet community needs, start projects, and support others.

Why the others are incorrect: option a (high grades) focuses on scores, which don’t guarantee useful abilities; option c (only ensuring attendance) is important but insufficient without relevant skills and quality learning; option d (only academic knowledge) ignores practical, social, and civic skills needed to improve a community.

Options:
a. Education is not always beneficial.
b. Education can lead to wealth but not happiness.
c. Education should focus on knowledge, not just material gains.
d. Education is beneficial when it promotes well-rounded development.


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
সমাধান:

1. প্রথমে গল্পের পাখির শিক্ষার ফল বিশ্লেষণ করা উচিত — পাখিটি জ্ঞান পেলেও যদি সেই শিক্ষা তার সামগ্রিক বিকাশ (নৈতিকতা, অনুভূতি, স্বাভাবিক আচরণ) অনুপস্থিত রেখে কেবল কৌশল বা কথাবার্তার দিকে সীমাবদ্ধ থাকে, তবে তা পূর্ণ সুবিধা দেয় না।  
2. মানুষের জীবনে শিক্ষার প্রকৃত লাভ তখনই স্থায়ী হয় যখন শিক্ষা শুধু তথ্য বা আয় অর্জনের উপায় নয়, বরং মানুষের মানসিক, নৈতিক ও সামাজিক দিকগুলোকে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করে।  
3. তাই অপশন ঘ ("Education is beneficial when it promotes well-rounded development.") সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত কারণ এটি পড়াশোনা ও চরিত্রোন্নয়নের সমন্বয়কে গুরুত্ব দেয়।  

অন্য অপশনগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত মন্তব্য: ক সম্পূর্ণ অসম্মত — শিক্ষা সাধারণত উপকারী; খ আংশিক সত্য হতে পারে কিন্তু সীমাবদ্ধ (শুধু ধন নয়, সুখও গুরুত্বপূর্ণ); গ জ্ঞানের উপর জোর দেয় কিন্তু সামগ্রিক বিকাশের গুরুত্ব অগ্রাহ্য করে। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হল ঘ.

- a ভুল, কারণ সাংস্কৃতিক ঐতিহ্য মনে রাখাতেই সহায়ক, সেটাকে মুছে ফেলা নয়।  
- b সঠিক, কারণ ঐতিহ্য আমাদের পরিচয়, মূল্যবোধ ও সম্প্রদায়ের সাথে সংযোগ স্থাপন করে।  
- c ভুল, কারণ ঐতিহ্যের অনেক সামাজিক, শিক্ষামূলক ও সাংস্কৃতিক সুফল আছে।

Options:
a. Classroom learning is better because of teacher interaction
b. Home learning is better since it's more comfortable
c. Both have their unique strengths
d. It depends on the subject being studied


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: শ্রেণীকক্ষের সুবিধা নির্ধারণ — সরাসরি শিক্ষকের নির্দেশনা, সহপাঠীদের সাথে আলোচনা, নিয়মিত পরিবেশ এবং তাত্ক্ষণিক প্রতিক্রিয়া শেখার গতি বাড়ায়।  
ধাপ ২: বাড়িতে শেখার সুবিধা নির্ধারণ — সময় ও পরিবেশ নিয়ন্ত্রণ, স্বাচ্ছন্দ্য, নমনীয়তা এবং প্রযুক্তি-আধারিত উপকরণ ব্যবহার করে ব্যক্তিগতভাবে অধ্যয়ন সহজ হয়।  
ধাপ ৩: তুলনা এবং সিদ্ধান্ত — দুইটিরই আলাদা শক্তি আছে; কিছু অধ্যয়নে (যেমন অভিজ্ঞতা-ভিত্তিক বা গ্রুপ কাজ) শ্রেণীকক্ষ বড় সুবিধা দেয়, আবার কিছু আত্মনির্ভর অধ্যয়নে বাড়িতে শেখা কার্যকর। তাই সর্বজনীনভাবে একটি একক বিকল্পকে সব সময় শ্রেষ্ঠ বলা ঠিক নয়।

উপসংহার: সঠিক উত্তর হলো c — Both have their unique strengths.

অন্য বিকল্পগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা:
- a (শ্রেণীকক্ষই ভাল): এটি অর্ধসত্য; কেবল শিক্ষক যোগাযোগই সব বিষয়ের জন্য যথেষ্ট নয়।  
- b (বাড়িতে শেখা ভাল): আরেকটি সীমাবদ্ধ দৃষ্টি; স্বাচ্ছন্দ্য থাকা সত্ত্বেও সামাজিক ও তাত্ক্ষণিক সহায়তার অভাব পড়তে পারে।  
- d (বিষয়ের উপর নির্ভর করে): এইটি অংশত ঠিক, কিন্তু প্রশ্নে সর্বোপরি তুলনা চাইছে; তাই সর্বোত্তম সার্বিক উত্তর হলো যে উভয়েরই অনন্য শক্তি আছে (c)।

What is the ultimate goal of education according to the proverb "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"?

Options:
a. To provide immediate help
b. To ensure lifelong self-sufficiency
c. To help people enjoy leisure
d. To prepare for exams


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish meets a one-time need, while teaching to fish provides the skill to obtain food repeatedly.  
Step 2: The ultimate goal emphasized is long-term independence and the ability to sustain oneself.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is b (to ensure lifelong self-sufficiency). Options a, c, and d are incorrect because (a) describes short-term aid, (c) is unrelated to survival skills, and (d) narrows education to exam preparation rather than self-reliance.

Options:
a. The bird was beautiful.
b. The bird needed to be useful.
c. The bird sang well.
d. The bird was a pet.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the story focus — what motive does the king express for educating the bird.  
Step 2: The text shows the king wanted the parrot to learn skills so it could be useful (serve a purpose), not merely admired or kept as a plaything.  
Therefore the correct choice is (b) The bird needed to be useful.

Explanation why other options are wrong:
- (a) The bird being beautiful is not given as the reason for education.  
- (c) The bird’s singing ability is not presented as the king’s motive.

d. By avoiding technology


Correct Answer: a

Solution:

Step 1: Identify the practical ways education affects a community — by giving people skills, new techniques, and knowledge that change daily practices and economic outcomes.  
Step 2: Match each option to that effect: option a (improving agricultural practices) directly increases crop yields, income, and food security in a local community; option b (teaching history) raises awareness but has less immediate practical impact on livelihoods; option c (following traditions only) limits adoption of beneficial innovations; option d (avoiding technology) prevents improvements.

1. প্রশ্ন অনুযায়ী ফোকাস ছিল কেবল পাখির খাঁচার দিকে, কিন্তু পাখিটিকে শিক্ষা দেয়া হয়নি—এখানেই মূল সমস্যা নির্দেশিত।  
2. গল্পের ফলাফল হিসেবে পাখিটি অসিক্ষিতই রয়ে যায় এবং শেষ পর্যন্ত মারা যায়—এটি সরাসরি নির্ধারিত ফলাফল।  
3. তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো বিকল্প (b)। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ (a) পাখি খ্যাত গায়ক হওয়ার কথা নেই, (c) পাখি শেখে উড়তে—এমন ঘটেনি, এবং (d) কেবল পোষা হওয়ার বিবরণও ঘটেনি; মূলত শিক্ষা না পাওয়ায় মৃত্যুই হয়েছে।

Question:
Compare the King’s perspective on education with that of the bird's teachers. Who do you think had a more effective understanding of education, and why?

Options:
a. The King, because he wanted the bird to be useful.
b. The teachers, because they focused on knowledge.
c. Both were equally effective.
d. Neither understood the purpose of education.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. প্রথমে দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি সংক্ষেপে: রাজা শিক্ষাকে ব্যবহারযোগ্যতা ও বাস্তব প্রয়োজনে মূল্য দিচ্ছিল, আর পাখির শিক্ষকরা জ্ঞানগত বিষয়—শিক্ষা অর্জনের ঐতিহ্যগত দিক—উপর গুরুত্ব দিচ্ছিলেন।
2. বিশ্লেষণ: কার্যকর শিক্ষা হচ্ছে এমন শিক্ষা যা শিক্ষার্থীর ক্ষমতা কাজে লাগাতে পারে ও জীবনে কার্যকর হয়; তাই রাজার মনোভাব বেশি বাস্তবসম্মত—পাখির জন্য প্রয়োজনীয় দক্ষতা ও ব্যবহারিক গুণ গঠনে গুরুত্ব দিয়েছিল। 
3. অন্য অপশনগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত প্রত্যাখ্যান: a হল সঠিক কারণ রাজা ব্যবহারিক উদ্দেশ্য বুঝেছেন; b ভুল কারণ শুধু জ্ঞান সংগ্রহ প্রয়োগ ছাড়া অপর্যাপ্ত; c ও d অযৌক্তিক কারণ দুটি পক্ষ সমানভাবে কার্যকর বা সম্পূর্ণ বোঝাপড়া বিহীন ছিল না।

Options:
a. কারণ প্যারোট গান গায়
b. কারণ প্যারোট অশিক্ষিত ছিল
c. কারণ প্যারোট রাজা কে ভালোবাসে
d. কারণ প্যারোট সবসময় দুষ্টুমি করে


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্ন থেকে লক্ষ্য করতে হবে রাজা কেন প্যারটকে শিক্ষা দিতে বললেন—এটি একটি কারণ নির্দেশ করে।  
ধাপ ২: বিকল্পগুলির মানে যাচাই করলে দেখা যায় খ ("কারণ প্যারট অশিক্ষিত ছিল") সরাসরি একটি কারণ হিসেবে উপযুক্ত; যদি প্যারট অশিক্ষিত থাকে তাহলে তাকে শেখানো প্রয়োজন।  
ধাপ ৩: অন্য বিকল্পগুলো অযৌক্তিক বা অনুপযুক্ত—ক (প্যারট গান গায়) থাকলে শেখানোর প্রয়োজন কমই থাকে, গ (প্যারট রাজাকে ভালোবাসে) ভালোবাসা শেখানোর কারণ নয়, এবং ঘ (প্যারট দুষ্টুমি করে) যদিও আচরণ সংশোধনের কারণ হতে পারে, কিন্তু মূল কারণ হিসেবে গল্পে সাধারণত অশিক্ষা দেখানো হয়।

b. জীবনের উন্নতি করা
c. বিলাসী জীবনযাপন
d. ঘন্টার পর ঘন্টা পড়া


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) শিক্ষার প্রকৃত উদ্দেশ্য সাধারণত ব্যক্তির জ্ঞান, নেতৃত্ব, চারিত্রিক ও দক্ষতার উন্নয়নের মাধ্যমে জীবনের মান উন্নত করা — অর্থাৎ ব্যক্তি এবং সমাজকে এগিয়ে নেওয়া।  
2) অপশন b (জীবনের উন্নতি করা) এই উদ্দেশ্যের সঙ্গে সরাসরি সামঞ্জস্যপূর্ণ, তাই এটি সঠিক উত্তর।  
3) অন্য অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ: a (সার্টিফিকেট অর্জন করা) কেবল বাহ্যিক স্বীকৃতি, c (বিলাসী জীবনযাপন) শিক্ষার মূল লক্ষ্য নয়, আর d (ঘন্টার পর ঘন্টা পড়া) কেবল সময় ব্যয়কে বোঝায়, কিন্তু উদ্দেশ্যগত উন্নতি নিশ্চিত করে না।

b. যাতে প্যারোটকে শিক্ষা দেওয়া যায়
c. প্যারোটকে খাঁচায় বন্দী করতে
d. রাজাকে খুশি করতে


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:  
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নে দেওয়া উদ্দেশ্যগুলো পর্যবেক্ষণ করে খাঁচার সাধারণ ব্যবহার বিবেচনা করতে হবে — প্যারোট সাধারণত কথা শেখাতে ও প্রশিক্ষণ দিতে খাঁচায় রাখা হয়।  
ধাপ ২: বিকল্পগুলো যাচাই করলে দেখা যায় (a) কেবল সুন্দর দেখানোর জন্য খাঁচা বানানো অপ্রাসঙ্গিক, (c) খাঁচা শুধু বন্দী করতে হলে প্রশ্নে বিশেষভাবে এমন উদ্দেশ্যের উল্লেখ থাকত না, আর (d) রাজাকে খুশি করার মতো লক্ষ্য সাধারণ উদ্দেশ্য নয়।

b. শিক্ষকদের কর্মের অবহেলা
c. রাজ্যের অভাব
d. জনগণের অসহযোগিতা

Options:
a. কারণ এটি শুধু বিনোদনের জন্য
b. কারণ এটি মানুষের চেতনা ও দক্ষতা বৃদ্ধি করে
c. কারণ এটি শুধু চাকরি পাওয়ার জন্য
d. কারণ এটি সম্পদ সঞ্চয়ের জন্য


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: শিক্ষা সমাজে মানুষের জ্ঞান, মূল্যবোধ ও দক্ষতা গড়ে তোলে এবং মানুষের সমষ্টিগত ক্ষমতা ও আউটপুট বাড়ায়।  
Step 2: তাই বিকল্প খ ("কারণ এটি মানুষের চেতনা ও দক্ষতা বৃদ্ধি করে") সঠিক—এটি সরাসরি সামাজিক উন্নয়ন ও অর্থনৈতিক প্রবৃদ্ধি ত্বরান্বিত করে।  
বাকি বিকল্পগুলোর ভুলতার সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: বিকল্প ক শুধুমাত্র বিনোদন বলা অতিরঞ্জিত, গ শুধুমাত্র চাকরির কারণ হিসেবে সীমাবদ্ধ এবং ঘ সম্পদ সঞ্চয়ের উদ্দেশ্যকে বেশি করে দেখেছে; এ কারণে এগুলো সামগ্রিকভাবে সমাজ উন্নয়নের মৌলিক ভূমিকা ব্যাখ্যা করে না।

c. শুধুমাত্র পুরনো পদ্ধতি অনুসরণ করে
d. শিক্ষকদের মতামত না নিয়ে

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
সমাধান:

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নের মূল ভাবনা শনাক্ত করা — "শিক্ষা কেন আমাদের জীবনে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ?" অর্থাৎ শিক্ষার প্রধান উদ্দেশ্য কী তা খুঁজে বের করা।  
ধাপ ২: প্রতিটি বিকল্প মূল্যায়ন করা — (a) বিনোদন দেয় (কিছু ক্ষেত্রে দেয় কিন্তু প্রধান কারণ নয়), (b) সমাজে উন্নতি করতে সহায়তা করে (শিক্ষার মৌলিক ভূমিকা: জ্ঞান, দক্ষতা ও নৈতিক মান বৃদ্ধি করে যা সমাজকে উন্নত করে), (c) শুধু ধনী হতে সাহায্য করে (অসত্য — শিক্ষা সকল শ্রেণির মানুষের উন্নতি ঘটায়), (d) কিছুই পরিবর্তন করে না (স্পষ্টভাবে মিথ্য)।

শিক্ষা কেন আমাদের জীবনে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ?

Options:
a. এটি আমাদের বিনোদন দেয়
b. এটি আমাদের দক্ষতা বৃদ্ধি করে
c. এটি কেবলমাত্র পরীক্ষায় ভালো করার জন্য
d. এটি সমাজে উন্নতি করতে সহায়তা করে


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নের মূল লক্ষ্য নির্ণয় করি — শিক্ষা কিসের জন্য দরকার: ব্যক্তিগত দক্ষতা, বিনোদন, পরীক্ষায় ভাল করা, নাকি সমাজ উন্নয়ন।  
ধাপ ২: প্রতিটি বিকল্প যাচাই করি — (a) বিনোদন পাওয়া সম্ভব হলেও তা শিক্ষার মুখ্য উদ্দেশ্য নয়; (b) দক্ষতা বৃদ্ধি করা একটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ দিক কিন্তু তা সম্পূর্ণ উদ্দেশ্যকে বর্ণনা করে না; (c) কেবল পরীক্ষায় ভাল হওয়াই লক্ষ্য ভুল ও সীমিত ধারণা; (d) শিক্ষা মানুষের দক্ষতা, নৈতিকতা, জ্ঞান ও সমন্বয় বৃদ্ধি করে, ফলে সমাজের সামগ্রিক উন্নয়ন সম্ভব হয়।  
ধাপ ৩: কারণ উপস্থাপন ও তুলনা করে দেখা যায় যে সবচেয়ে বিস্তৃত এবং উপযুক্ত উত্তর হলো (d) — এটি সমাজে উন্নতি করতে সহায়তা করে, তাই সঠিক উত্তর: d।

Options:
a. To compare with foreign cultures
b. To create a sense of belonging
c. To impress others
d. To avoid misunderstandings


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main purpose of learning local cultures — understanding traditions, values and shared practices helps people feel connected and accepted within a community.  
Step 2: Compare each option with that purpose: option (b) "To create a sense of belonging" directly matches the primary social and emotional benefit of learning local cultures.  
Step 3: Conclude that (b) is correct. 

Brief note on other options: (a) Comparing with foreign cultures can be a secondary outcome but is not the primary reason; (c) "To impress others" is not a constructive or genuine purpose; (d) "To avoid misunderstandings" is a valid benefit, but it is more of a practical consequence rather than the central reason.

ধাপ ২: উপায়গুলো বিশ্লেষণ করলে দেখা যায় যে (b) "By encouraging volunteer activities" সরাসরি সামাজিক সহায়তা, সমবায় কাজে অংশগ্রহণ এবং সম্প্রদায় সচেতনতা বাড়ায়, ফলে সামগ্রিক উন্নতি ঘটে—এই কারণে (b) সঠিক।

Options:
a. Passive learning
b. Volunteerism
c. Academic learning
d. Critical learning


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. ঘটনার বিবরণ: একজন ছাত্র প্রতিবেশীর কাছ থেকে কীর্ত্নার মতো ক্রয়করা জিনিসপত্র বহন করে সাহায্য করছে — এটি স্বেচ্ছাসেবামূলক, অপরিশোধিত সহায়তা।  
2. Volunteerism (স্বেচ্ছাসেবা) বলতে এমন কাজ বোঝায় যা মানুষ নিজের ইচ্ছায় অন্যদের উপকারে বিনা পারিশ্রমিকে করে। তাই প্রদত্ত ঘটনাটি স্পষ্টভাবে Volunteerism-এ পড়ে।  
3. অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলি ভুল কারণ: Passive learning মানে গ্রহণশীল শেখা (কাজ-সহায়তা নয়), Academic learning হলো শ্রেণিকক্ষভিত্তিক পাঠ্য শিক্ষার কার্যক্রম, এবং Critical learning হলো বিশ্লেষণাত্মক চিন্তা বিকাশ—এগুলোই ঘটনার সাথে মিলছে না।

In what ways can education be recognized as both a right and a responsibility in society?

Options:
a. Education is only a right
b. Education is only a responsibility
c. Education must be provided for free
d. Education requires participation and contribution from everyone


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the terms — a "right" means people are entitled to access education (state duty), while a "responsibility" means learners, families, schools and society must participate and contribute to making education effective.  
Step 2: Compare options — a and b are each one-sided (only right or only responsibility) and therefore incomplete; c (education must be free) is a policy position that may be true in many contexts but does not capture the idea of mutual duties.  
Step 3: Conclude — d is correct because it explicitly states that education involves both entitlement (access/provision) and active participation and contribution from everyone, covering both the "right" and "responsibility" aspects.

Question:
What is the ultimate goal of education according to the proverb, 'Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime'?

Options:
a. To provide temporary help
b. To ensure self-sufficiency
c. To entertain students
d. To memorize facts


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — "give a person a fish" means providing short-term aid, while "teach a person to fish" means giving a lasting skill.  
Step 2: Relate this to education: the proverb emphasizes enabling a person to support themselves independently over the long term.  
Therefore the correct choice is b (to ensure self-sufficiency).  
Other options are incorrect because (a) describes only temporary help, (c) focuses on entertainment, and (d) limits education to rote memorization, none of which capture the proverb’s aim of long-term independence.

Options:
a. Because it was beautiful
b. Because it brought profit to the royal market
c. Because it could sing well
d. Because it was a pet


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the motive given in the story — the king wanted the bird trained so it would fetch money by being sold or displayed for profit in the royal market.  
Step 2: Match that motive to the options: b ("Because it brought profit to the royal market") directly states this reason, so it is the correct choice.  
Step 3: Explain why the others are wrong: a (beauty), c (singing ability), and d (pet) do not reflect the story’s emphasis on economic gain, so they are incorrect.

Options:
a. By ignoring others' needs
b. By focusing only on material wealth
c. By ensuring education is meaningful
d. By following traditions without question


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central lesson of "The Parrot's Tale" — that true learning should be meaningful, compassionate, and transform behavior rather than just accumulate facts or possessions.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that lesson: option (c) "ensuring education is meaningful" directly matches the story's emphasis on purposeful learning.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: (a) ignores compassion, (b) focuses on material wealth not learning, and (d) accepts tradition without reflection, which can prevent growth.  
Therefore the correct answer is (c) because it best reflects the story’s message about making education purposeful and ethical.

Which of the following statements best analyzes the outcome of the bird's education?

Options:
a. The education improved the bird's singing ability
b. The bird became more beautiful
c. The education ultimately harmed the bird
d. The bird learned to fly better


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the outcome described — the bird's “education” changed its natural behavior in a way that did not benefit it in the long run.
Step 2: Compare each option to that outcome. The description implies the training disrupted the bird’s instincts or well‑being, so the net effect was harmful, matching option (c).
Explanation why others are incorrect: Option (a) — there is no clear evidence the bird’s singing improved; (b) — appearance/beauty is unrelated to the described outcome; (d) — nothing indicates its flying ability improved. Therefore the best answer is (c).

Question:
If you were the teacher in 'The Parrot's Tale', how would you change the approach to educate the bird effectively?

Options:
a. By providing only texts
b. By ensuring it has a proper environment
c. By focusing on its physical appearance
d. By ignoring its natural instincts


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Step 1 — Identify learning needs: A parrot learns through interaction, mimicry, and a stimulating, safe environment, so the primary change is to provide appropriate surroundings (perches, toys, social contact, consistent routine).
2. Step 2 — Implement teaching methods: Use positive reinforcement, regular vocal interaction, and environmental enrichment rather than only written material; this supports natural behaviors and learning.
3. Reasoning and elimination: Option (b) is correct because a proper environment enables learning; (a) is wrong since parrots do not learn from texts alone, (c) is irrelevant because appearance does not teach behavior, and (d) is harmful because ignoring instincts prevents effective education.

a. Education is about accumulating wealth.
b. Education should prioritize the needs of individuals.
c. Education is meaningless without practical application.
d. Education is only for the rich.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the tale’s core event: the parrot knows words or facts but cannot use them meaningfully in real life, so the story emphasizes that knowledge must be applied to be valuable.
2. That matches option c: Education is meaningless without practical application — this is the main lesson.
3. Options a and d are wrong because the story does not link education to accumulating wealth or exclusive access for the rich; option b (prioritizing individual needs) is not the central theme, which is the necessity of practical use.

Options:

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: From the story we look for the king’s explicit instruction regarding the bird — the text states he commanded that the bird should be taught and learn manners/knowledge.  
Step 2: That instruction corresponds directly to option b: “To be educated.”  
Step 3: Other options are inconsistent with the command: a (“To be set free”) and c (“To be fed”) are not mentioned as orders, and d (“To sing”) is a possible outcome but not the king’s directive. Therefore the correct answer is b.

Why did the bird ultimately fail to learn anything?

Options:
a. It was not interested in education.
b. It was too busy taking care of its cage.
c. The cage was too small.
d. It received too much information without understanding.


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the stem — the bird “failed to learn anything,” so we look for an option that explains lack of learning, not mere distraction or environment.
Step 2: Evaluate options by relevance: (a) lack of interest would be a behavioral cause but is not stated; (b) being busy with its cage is specific and unlikely the intended reason; (c) a small cage may limit movement but doesn't directly explain failure to learn.
Step 3: Option (d) says it “received too much information without understanding,” which describes cognitive overload or rote input without comprehension — this directly prevents learning. Therefore (d) is correct because meaningful learning requires understanding, not just receiving information.

Step 2: Match that lesson to the options: b (ensuring education includes practical skills) directly applies because it promotes applied knowledge, problem-solving, and relevance.  
Step 3: Reject the others briefly: (a) rote memorization and (c) focusing only on theory ignore application and critical thinking; (d) ignoring students' needs contradicts the story’s emphasis on responsive, student-centered learning.

Question:
What is the main message of the proverb "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"?

Options:
a. Education is more important than material help
b. Fishing is the best skill to learn
c. Providing food every day is enough
d. Only rich people can teach others


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: The proverb contrasts two actions—giving a fish (short-term relief) versus teaching fishing (long-term self-sufficiency). It emphasizes that teaching someone a skill lets them provide for themselves over time, so empowerment through education or training is better than one-time material aid. Therefore the main message matches option a: education (or skill-building) is more important than merely giving material help. Options b, c, and d are incorrect because the proverb is not literally promoting fishing, it does not claim daily food is sufficient, nor does it say only wealthy people can teach.

Step 1: Recall the story— the parrot was snatching or damaging fruits and disturbing the fruit sellers and market order.  
Step 2: The King’s decision to educate the bird was intended to stop that nuisance and protect the sellers, so the correct choice is option c.  
Why the others are wrong: a is incorrect because the bird was not described as a special pet; b is wrong because the motive was not its singing ability; d is wrong because the King’s aim was practical (preventing trouble), not showing off.

Question:
How can modern technology, like AI, assist in education according to the article?

Options:
a. By replacing teachers completely
b. By providing personalized learning experiences
c. By making students lazy
d. By only helping in grading


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: পড়ুন প্রশ্ন ও বিকল্পগুলো এবং নিবিড়ভাবে যাচাই করুন—প্রশ্নটি বলছে আধুনিক প্রযুক্তি, যেমন AI, কিভাবে শিক্ষায় সহায়তা করতে পারে।  
Step 2: নিবন্ধে উল্লেখিত মূল পয়েন্ট অনুসারে AI-এর সুবিধা হল শিক্ষার্থীদের জন্য ব্যক্তিগতকৃত শেখার অভিজ্ঞতা তৈরি করা (পঠনের গতি, শক্ত ও দুর্বল দিক অনুযায়ী কন্টেন্ট ও অনুশীলন সামঞ্জস্য করা)। তাই বিকল্প b সবচেয়ে সঠিক।  
কেন অন্যগুলো ভুল: বিকল্প a (শিক্ষকদের সম্পূর্ণভাবে প্রতিস্থাপন) অত্যুক্তিপূর্ণ দাবি—নিবন্ধে AI-এর সহায়ক ভূমিকার কথা বলা হয়েছে, না যে শিক্ষকদের পুরোপুরি বদলে দেবে; বিকল্প c (শিক্ষার্থীদের অলস করে তোলা) একটি সম্ভাব্য নেতিবাচক অনুমান, কিন্তু এটি সাহায্যের পদ্ধতি নয়; বিকল্প d (শুধুমাত্র গ্রেডিং-এ সহায়তা) অতি সঙ্কীর্ণ বিবরণ, কারণ নিবন্ধে ব্যক্তিগতকরণ, অনলাইন টিউটরিং ইত্যাদিও উল্লেখ আছে।  
সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: b

Question:
In the story, what was the ultimate fate of the bird after being educated?

Options:
a. It became a great singer
b. It learned many scriptures
c. It lost its ability to sing and fly
d. It escaped from the cage


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question carefully — it asks for the bird’s ultimate fate after being educated.  
Step 2: Recall the story detail: after education the bird lost its natural abilities and could neither sing nor fly, which matches option (c).  
Step 3: Briefly rule out the others: (a) contradicts the loss of singing, (b) is irrelevant to the bird’s physical abilities, and (d) is false because the bird did not escape.  
Therefore the correct answer is (c).

b. By allowing it to learn naturally without restrictions
c. By hiring many teachers to give it lessons
d. By feeding it a variety of foods


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) লক্ষ্য: পাখিটিকে অর্থবহ শিক্ষা দেওয়া মানে তাকে কৌতূহল, নিজে চেষ্টা করার সুযোগ ও পরিবেশ থেকে শেখার স্বাধীনতা দেওয়া।  
2) বিকল্পবিশ্লেষণ: ক বিলাসবহুল খাঁচা পাখিটিকে সীমাবদ্ধ করে—শিক্ষার সুযোগ কমে; খ প্রাকৃতিকভাবে শেখার অনুমতি দিলে পাখি নিজের পরিবেশ থেকে পর্যবেক্ষণ, অনুশীলন ও সামাজিক শিক্ষার মাধ্যমে অর্থবহ জ্ঞান অর্জন করে (সঠিক উত্তর); গ অনেক শিক্ষক থাকা মানে শিক্ষার গুণমান নিশ্চিত নাও হতে পারে এবং অতিরিক্ত ঠিক না; ঘ বিভিন্ন খাদ্য পুষ্টির জন্য দরকার, কিন্তু সরাসরি শিক্ষা নিশ্চিত করে না।  
3) উপসংহার: সেরা পছন্দ হলো খ — পাখিটিকে প্রকৃতভাবে বেঁচে ও অন্বেষণ করে শেখার স্বাধীনতা দেওয়া।

b. "শিক্ষা ছাড়া কিছুই হয় না" 
c. "শিক্ষা হল জীবনের আলো" 
d. "শিক্ষা মানুষের উন্নতির পথ" 


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রবাদ হলো সংক্ষেপে জাতীয় জ্ঞাণ বা নীতিবাণী বোঝানো একটি প্রচলিত বাগধারা।  
ক "শিক্ষা হল চাবি" — এটি একটি রূপক বাক্য, কিন্তু প্রচলিত প্রবাদ হিসেবে তেমন পরচলিত নয়।

c. সমাজে মর্যাদা অর্জন করা
d. কেবল পরীক্ষায় পাশ করা


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপে ধাপে ব্যাখ্যা:
1. শিক্ষার প্রধান লক্ষ্য হলো মানুষের জ্ঞান, বোধশক্তি ও চিন্তাশীলতা বৃদ্ধি করে তার সামগ্রিক বিকাশ ঘটানো; তাই মূল উদ্দেশ্য জ্ঞান অর্জন করা।
2. জ্ঞান থাকলে ব্যক্তি দক্ষতা গড়ে তুলতে পারে, নৈতিক ও সামাজিক মূল্যবোধ অর্জন করে এবং জীবনে সমাধান খুঁজে পেতে সক্ষম হয়—এগুলোই শিক্ষার মূল ফলাফল।
3. অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো মাধ্যম বা পার্শ্বলক্ষ্য: চাকরি পাওয়া ও সমাজে মর্যাদা (a ও c) এবং কেবল পরীক্ষায় পাশ করা (d) সবই জ্ঞান অর্জনের উপর নির্ভর করে এবং সেগুলোই শিক্ষার শেষ লক্ষ্য নয়।

c. সময় নষ্ট করে
d. পরিবারের সঙ্গে সময় কাটাতে বাধা দেয়


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে প্রশ্ন থেকে বোঝা যায় যে শিক্ষা মানুষের জ্ঞান, দক্ষতা ও মানসিক শক্তি বাড়ায় — তাই যেটা সরাসরি ব্যক্তির ইতিবাচক উন্নতি বোঝায় সেটিই সঠিক। তুলনা করে দেখলে ক (বিনোদন দেয়) কেবল শখের দিক, গ (সময় নষ্ট করে) এবং ঘ (পরিবারের সঙ্গে সময় কাটাতে বাধা দেয়) নেতিবাচক বা অপ্রাসঙ্গিক বিবৃতি। অতএব সরাসরি উপযোগী ও সত্য বক্তব্য হল খ (আত্মবিশ্বাস বাড়ায়), তাই এটি সঠিক উত্তর।

Options:
a. শিক্ষক নিয়োগ করা
b. ছাত্রদের ভর্তি করা
c. একটি পরিকল্পনা তৈরি করা
d. শিক্ষা উপকরণ কিনা


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমেই একটি পরিষ্কার এবং বিস্তারিত পরিকল্পনা তৈরি করা উচিত যাতে স্কুলের লক্ষ্য, পাঠ্যক্রম, বাজেট, স্থান, লাইসেন্স ও সময়রেখা নির্ধারিত থাকে। এই পরিকল্পনা ছাড়া শিক্ষক নিয়োগ, ভর্তি বা উপকরণ কেনার মতো সিদ্ধান্ত বিনিয়োগ-অদক্ষ এবং অনির্ধারিত হবে। ক শিক্ষক নিয়োগ করা এবং খ ছাত্রদের ভর্তি করা দুইটিই পরিকল্পনা ও অনুমোদন প্রয়োজন হওয়ার কারণে প্রথমে করা যায় না; ঘ শিক্ষা উপকরণ কেনাও পাঠ্যক্রম ও বাজেট নির্ধারিত না হলে অপ্রয়োজনীয় খরচ হতে পারে। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো গ — একটি পরিকল্পনা তৈরি করা।

c. তার জন্য বিশেষ সময় নির্ধারণ করা

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে সমস্যা বিশ্লেষণ করে মূল কারণ খুঁজে বের করা দরকার—অন্তত শিক্ষক, ছাত্র ও অভিভাবকদের সঙ্গে আলোচনা করে সমাধান করা সবচেয়ে কার্যকর। তাই b (তার অভিভাবকদের সাথে আলোচনা করা) সঠিক উত্তর, কারণ পরিবারে সমন্বয় করে সময়সূচি, ঘুম বা পরিবহনের সমস্যা ঠিক করা যায় এবং টেকসই সমাধান পাওয়া যায়। অন্য অপশনগুলো কেন কম উপযুক্ত তা সংক্ষেপে: a (শাস্তি) সমস্যা ডাকে প্রতিরোধ বা ভীতিকর আচরণ তৈরি করতে পারে; c (বিশেষ সময় নির্ধারণ) লোপপোক্ত আচরণকে উৎসাহিত করতে পারে এবং সার্বিক নিয়ম ভাঙ্গে; d (শিক্ষার্থীকে প্রশ্ন করা) প্রয়োজনীয় প্রথম ধাপ হতে পারে কিন্তু একাকী কার্যকর নয়—অভিভাবকসহ সমন্বয় প্রয়োজন।

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান:
 ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নে দেওয়া অপশনগুলোর মধ্যে ক পদ্মফুল হলো সবচেয়ে প্রাসঙ্গিক, কারণ বাংলাদেশে জাতীয় ফুল হিসেবে পরিচিত ফুলটি দেশীয়ভাবে শাপলা/পদ্মফুল হিসেবে উঠে আসে।  
 ধাপ ২: ঐতিহাসিক ও সাংস্কৃতিক প্রেক্ষাপটে শাপলা (পদ্মফুল) বাংলাদেশের প্রতীকী ফুল হিসেবে ঘোষিত হয়েছে, তাই সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে ক।

c. বন্ধু তৈরি করা

Options:
a. গরম অনুভব হয়
b. মন শান্ত হয়
c. ঘুম আসে
d. ক্লান্তি বাড়ে


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) গাছের ছায়ায় বসলে সরাসরি সূর্যের তাপ কম পড়ে এবং পরিবেশ ঠাণ্ডা হয়, ফলে দেহ ও মন দুটোই আরাম পায়।  
2) গাছ থেকে নিঃসৃত অক্সিজেন ও প্রাকৃতিক গন্ধ (ফাইটোনসাইড) এবং সবুজ রং মানসিক চাপ কমায়, তাই মন শান্ত হয়।  
3) অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হল b: মন শান্ত হয়। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো অপ্রযোজ্য—a (গরম অনুভব) তিক্ত কারণ ছায়া সাধারণত ঠাণ্ডা করে, c (ঘুম আসে) ও d (ক্লান্তি বাড়ে) কখনো কখনো ঘটতে পারে কিন্তু সার্বিক ও মূল উপকারিতা নয়।

c. পরীক্ষায় ভালো ফলাফলের জন্য

সমাধান:
1) লক্ষ্য নির্ধারণ: নিয়মিত পড়াশোনার মূল উদ্দেশ্য হল নিজে দক্ষতা অর্জন করে সমাজ ও দেশের উন্নতিতে অবদান রাখা — এটি দীর্ঘমেয়াদি, ইতিবাচক লক্ষ্য।  
2) বিকল্পগুলোর তুলনা: বিকল্প b সমাজের উন্নতিতে অবদান রাখার কথা বলছে, যা ব্যক্তিগত জ্ঞান ও দক্ষতা কাজে লাগিয়ে বৃহত্তর ইতিবাচক পরিবর্তন আনে; তাই এটি সবচেয়ে গ্রহণযোগ্য কারণ।  
3) অন্যগুলো কেন ঠিক নয়: a (শিক্ষকদের খুশি করার জন্য) হল বাহ্যিক ও অস্থায়ী প্রেষণা; c (পরীক্ষায় ভালো ফলাফলের জন্য) শুধু স্বল্পমেয়াদি ফলাফল লক্ষ্য করে; d (বন্ধুদের থেকে এগিয়ে থাকার জন্য) প্রতিযোগিতামূলক ও নেতিবাচক উদ্দেশ্য।

ধাপ ২: প্রতিটি বিকল্পের কার্যকারিতা মূল্যায়ন করুন: খরচ, বাস্তবায়ন সময় ও জনপ্রভূমি।  
ধাপ ৩: "সকলকে পড়ালেখার জন্য উৎসাহিত করা" (option b) সবচেয়ে দ্রুত এবং ব্যাপক প্রভাব ফেলে: এটি উপস্থিতি ও উৎসাহ বাড়ায়, পারিবারিক ও সমাজিক সমর্থন জোগায় এবং সস্তা ও টেকসই হওয়ায় অন্যান্য উদ্যোগগুলোর সঙ্গে সহজে মিলিত হয়।  
ধাপ ৪: অন্য বিকল্পগুলির সীমাবদ্ধতা সংক্ষেপে: (a) নতুন স্কুল বানানো সময়সাপেক্ষ ও ব্যয়বহুল, (c) বই সংগ্রহ করা উপকারী কিন্তু সীমিত সম্পদে সীমাবদ্ধ প্রভাব রাখে, (d) গ্রামীণ নেতাদের সাথে আলোচনা দরকারি কিন্তু সরাসরি ফল আপনার প্রয়াস ছাড়া সীমিত থাকতে পারে। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে option b।

d. শিক্ষা শুধুমাত্র সামাজিক সম্পর্ক তৈরি করা


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান:
প্রথমে কাহিনীর মূল বার্তা শনাক্ত করতে হবে — কাহিনীটি দেখায় যে শেখা শুধুমাত্র বইয়ের তত্ত্ব পড়া নয়, বাস্তব অভিজ্ঞতা, পর্যবেক্ষণ ও নৈতিক শিক্ষা থেকেও আসে। তাই বিকল্প a ("শিক্ষা শুধুমাত্র বই পড়া নয়") সরাসরি কাহিনীর মূল বক্তব্যের সাথে মিলে যায়। অন্য বিকল্পগুলো তৎপর্যগতভাবে সীমাবদ্ধ: b ও c কেবল পরীক্ষার ফল বা পেশাগত দক্ষতার দিকে সীমাবদ্ধ করে এবং d শুধু সামাজিক সম্পর্ককে শিক্ষার সমতুল্য মনে করে — এগুলো কাহিনীর পূর্ণ অর্থ ধরা হয়নি। ফলে সঠিক উত্তর হলো a।

c. শিক্ষকের মাধ্যমে
d. অনলাইন কোর্সের মাধ্যমে


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
সমাধান:  
Step 1: প্রশ্নের মানে হলো শিক্ষক বা বইয়ের তথ্য ছাড়া শেখার পদ্ধতিই মূল বিষয় — তাই আমরা এমন উত্তর খুঁজব যা "কীভাবে শিখতে হয়"‑এর ওপর জোর দেয়।  
Step 2: "অভিজ্ঞতার মাধ্যমে" মানে করা, অনুশীলন করা ও বাস্তবে প্রয়োগ করে শেখা; এই পদ্ধতিতে জ্ঞান গভীরে যায় এবং দক্ষতা গড়ে ওঠে, তাই এটি সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত।  
অন্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ বই পড়ে (b) কেবল তথ্য দেয় কিন্তু অনুশীলন ও প্রয়োগ করায় না; শিক্ষকের মাধ্যমে (c) সহায়ক কিন্তু নিজে করে শেখার উপায়কে প্রতিস্থাপন করে না; অনলাইন কোর্স (d) তথ্য সরবরাহ করে, তবে মূলত অভিজ্ঞতার মাধ্যমে চর্চাই শেখার মূল পথ।

What is the ultimate goal of education?

Options:
a. To memorize facts
b. To gain knowledge and skills for life
c. To pass exams
d. To follow rules


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the broad purpose of education — long-term development of a person’s abilities and preparation for life.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that purpose: option b ("To gain knowledge and skills for life") directly matches the long-term aim of education, while options a, c, and d are narrower, short-term or instrumental goals.  
Step 3: Conclude that the ultimate goal is option b because education seeks to build understanding, critical thinking, practical skills, and lifelong learning habits, not merely memorization, exam success, or blind rule-following.  

Explanation of incorrect options: memorizing facts (a) and passing exams (c) are temporary outcomes; following rules (d) may be part of discipline but is not the primary, overarching aim.

d. It is a fun activity only


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: ধারণা যাচাই — একটি দক্ষতা শেখা (যেমন মাছ শিকত শেখা) হল এমন জ্ঞান ও ক্ষমতা পাওয়া যার মাধ্যমে বারবার সুবিধা অর্জন করা যায়, ন্যূনতম নির্ভরশীলতায় নিজে নিজের খাবার জোগাড় করা সম্ভব হয়।  
ধাপ ২: ফলে একটি দক্ষতা দীর্ঘমেয়াদে স্বনির্ভরতা নিশ্চিত করে; তাই "এটি একজনকে পুরো জীবনে নিজের খাবার জোগাতে সক্ষম করে"—এটাই সঠিক যুক্তি। তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো (c)।  
অন্য বিকল্পগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত অবান্তরতা: (a) ভুল, কারণ মাছ শিকতে সাধারণত সরঞ্জাম লাগে; (b) ভুল, কারণ কেবল একটি মাছ দেওয়া কেবল এক দিনের প্রয়োজন মেটায়; (d) ভুল, কারণ মজার দিক থাকলেও মূল উদ্দেশ্য স্বনির্ভরতা ও খাদ্যসংগ্রহ।

ধাপ ২: বিকল্প c (স্বনির্ভর ব্যবসা শুরু করা) অর্থনৈতিক সুযোগ তৈরি করে আয় বাড়ায় এবং কর্মসংস্থান সৃষ্টি করে।

Question:
Analyze the impact of education on society. What can happen if education is ignored?

Options:
a. Society becomes more skilled
b. There will be more crime and poverty
c. People will be happier
d. There is no effect


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: অর্থাৎ শিক্ষা মানুষের মানবসম্পদ (human capital) বাড়ায় — অনুমান করুন [math]H \propto E[/math], যেখানে [math]H[/math] হল দক্ষতা/আয় এবং [math]E[/math] হল শিক্ষা।  
Step 2: শিক্ষা উপেক্ষা করলে দক্ষতা ও কর্মসংস্থান কমে, সুযোগনৈষ্ঠ্য বেড়ে দারিদ্র্য ও অপরাধের ঝুঁকি বাড়ে; তাই সমাজে অস্থিতিশীলতা ও অপ্রগতির সম্ভাবনা থাকে।  
Step 3: অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হলো (b) — "There will be more crime and poverty"। অপশনের (a) উল্টো কথা বলে, (c) সুখ নিশ্চিত করে না এবং (d) "no effect" বাস্তবতার সাথে সঙ্গতিপূর্ণ নয়।

Question:
What is the main goal of education according to the proverb, "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"?

Options:
a. To provide immediate food
b. To ensure lifelong skills
c. To entertain students
d. To maintain discipline


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish provides a one-time benefit, while teaching to fish gives a person the ability to provide for themselves indefinitely.  
Step 2: Match this interpretation to the choices: the proverb emphasizes creating lasting, self-sustaining ability, which corresponds to option b (ensure lifelong skills).  
Briefly why others are incorrect: option a refers to immediate aid (one day), option c (entertain students) is unrelated, and option d (maintain discipline) is not the proverb’s focus.

Question:
Why did the King decide to educate the unlettered bird in "The Parrot's Tale"?

Options:
a. Because the bird was beautiful
b. To make it more useful
c. To please the common people
d. To show off his power


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the king’s motive in the story—he chose to teach the unlettered parrot so that the bird could speak and behave in a useful, improved way rather than remain ignorant.
Step 2: Match this motive to the options: this directly corresponds to option b ("To make it more useful").
Why the others are incorrect: option a (beauty) is not given as a reason; option c (to please the common people) is not supported by the text; option d (to show off his power) is not the parrot’s stated purpose. Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
In real life, how can education help improve a community?

Options:
a. By increasing the population
b. By promoting local businesses
c. By providing knowledge and skills
d. By reducing the number of schools


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the primary function of education — it provides people with knowledge, critical thinking and practical skills that enable them to earn, innovate and participate in community life.  
Step 2: Because educated individuals can solve problems, start businesses, improve health and teach others, education directly raises the overall capacity and well‑being of a community.  
Step 3: Therefore the best choice is option c: By providing knowledge and skills.

Explanation of other options:  
- a is incorrect because education does not inherently increase population.  
- b is partially true (education can help local businesses), but it is a secondary effect, not the fundamental role.  
- d is incorrect because reducing the number of schools would harm, not help, community improvement.

Options:
a. It was effective and valuable
b. It was unnecessary
c. It was flawed and incomplete
d. It was better than traditional education


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: সমস্যা বিশ্লেষণ — যদি পাখিটি আর কখনো উড়তে শিখে না, তা হলে শিক্ষার মূল উদ্দেশ্য (প্রয়োজনীয় দক্ষতা ফিরিয়ে দেওয়া) পূরণ হয়নি।  
Step 2: যুক্তি — কার্যকর শিক্ষা সেই ব্যক্তি/প্রাণীকে লক্ষ্যমাত্রার দক্ষতা অর্জনে সক্ষম করে; এখানে উড়তে না পারা দেখে শিক্ষা ত্রুটিপূর্ণ ও অসম্পূর্ণ ছিল।  
Step 3: অপশনগুলোর তুলনা — a (কার্যকর) ফলাফলের সঙ্গে বিরোধে; b (অপ্রয়োজনীয়) ভুল, কারণ পাখির জন্য উড়া প্রয়োজনীয় ছিল; d (ঐতিহ্যবাহী শিক্ষার চেয়ে ভাল) দাবি সম্পূর্ণত অসঙ্গত কারণ ফল খারাপ।

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the core aim of education — it is primarily to develop a person's understanding, abilities, and competencies.  
Step 2: Compare options: option (a) "To earn money" is a possible outcome but not the main purpose; option (c) "To compete with others" is a secondary effect, not the central goal; option (d) "To attend school" describes a means, not the purpose.

Question:
If a farmer uses organic fertilizers instead of chemical ones, what benefit does he gain?

Options:
a. More pests
b. Higher soil health
c. Increased costs
d. Less crop yield


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Understand the effect: organic fertilizers add organic matter and support beneficial soil organisms, improving soil structure, water retention and nutrient cycling.  
2. Reasoning: healthier soil leads to long-term improved fertility and resilience, so the primary benefit is higher soil health.  
3. Why others are wrong: "More pests" is incorrect because organic practices often support natural pest control; "Increased costs" and "Less crop yield" are not general benefits—costs and yields vary, but the clear direct benefit listed is higher soil health (option b).

Analyze the phrase "An empty pot makes the loudest noise." What does it imply about knowledge?

Options:
a. Knowledge is loud
b. Those who know less often brag more
c. Quiet people are not knowledgeable
d. Loudness is a sign of wisdom


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. The proverb "An empty pot makes the loudest noise" is a metaphor: an "empty" pot (lack of substance) makes more noise, so loudness implies lack of real content.  
2. Comparing options, b ("Those who know less often brag more") directly matches this meaning — people with little knowledge tend to boast loudly.  
3. The others are incorrect: a and d state the opposite (that knowledge or wisdom is loud), and c wrongly assumes quiet people lack knowledge; both contradict the proverb.

Step 1: Identify what effective teamwork requires — clear communication, fair division of tasks, and listening to others.  
Step 2: Compare each option: option c says "sharing tasks and communicating," which matches those teamwork qualities.

Predict how education will change in the next 20 years in Bangladesh.

Options:
a. It will become less important
b. Technology will play a larger role
c. Students will stop learning
d. Schools will close down


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Observe current trends: increased internet and smartphone penetration, growth of online learning platforms, and government/private investment in educational technology point to expanding digital tools in classrooms and remote learning.

Step 2 — Reasoning: given these trends, the most probable change in 20 years is greater integration of technology (adaptive learning, virtual classrooms, digital assessment), which improves access and personalisation.

Step 3 — Conclusion: option (b) "Technology will play a larger role" is correct because it follows from observable trends and feasible developments. The other options are unlikely: (a) education becoming less important contradicts economic and social incentives; (c) students stopping learning is unrealistic; (d) wholesale school closures are improbable since physical schools will still be needed alongside digital options.

What does the proverb, "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime," signify?

Options:
a. Providing temporary help is more beneficial than teaching skills.
b. Education has lasting effects on an individual's life.
c. Fishing is more important than education.
d. Helping others is not necessary.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Interpret the proverb: it contrasts giving immediate, short-term help (giving a fish) with teaching a lasting skill (teaching to fish).  
2. Identify the meaning: the proverb emphasizes that teaching skills or educating someone provides long-term independence and benefit, which matches option b.  
3. Why other choices are wrong: option a states the opposite (claims temporary help is more beneficial), option c focuses on fishing literally and misses the metaphor, and option d incorrectly concludes that helping others is unnecessary.  
4. Therefore the correct answer is b: Education has lasting effects on an individual's life.

Options:

b. The King wanted to show off his wealth.
c. The bird was seen as unuseful and uneducated.
d. The bird's singing was beautiful.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution: Read the question to identify the king’s motive and match it to the options. The correct answer is (c) because the king ordered the bird to be educated when the bird was regarded as unuseful and uneducated, so education was intended to make it useful. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect since there is no indication the bird was disturbing subjects or that the king wanted to flaunt wealth; (d) is wrong because beautiful singing would not be a reason to order education. Therefore the choice (c) best matches the stated motive.

2) গ্রামীণ বাংলাদেশের প্রচলিত পদ্ধতিতে অনেক ক্ষেত্রেই স্মরণশক্তি ও রটনাকেই গুরুত্ব দেওয়া হয়, কিন্তু পাখিটির ক্ষেত্রে তা থেকেও বেশি মাত্রায় ভান করা (appearance) লক্ষ্য ছিল। অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হল (b) — পাখির শিক্ষা ছিল substance-এর চেয়ে appearances-এর ওপর বেশি কেন্দ্রিত।  
3) অন্য অপশনগুলো কেন ভুল: (a) ভুল কারণ উভয়ই কেবলমাত্র রটনাই করে ক’বরে নয়—পাখিটির ক্ষেত্রে মূলত ভান ছিল; (c) ভুল কারণ ঐতিহ্যগত পদ্ধতি সবসময় বেশি কার্যকর নয়; (d) ভুল কারণ উভয়ই সমালোচনামূলক চিন্তা উন্নীত করে না।

Options:
a. The King is indifferent to the bird's needs.
b. The King emphasizes the importance of education for all.
c. The King only cares about the royal image.
d. The King believes education is unnecessary.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the theme — responsibility in education means leaders should promote learning and ensure access for everyone.  
Step 2: The King’s character demonstrates this by stressing that education matters for all subjects (including the bird), showing concern for learning rather than ignoring needs. Therefore option b is correct.  
Step 3: Options a, c, and d are incorrect because they claim indifference, mere concern for appearance, or rejection of education, which contradict the King’s portrayed active support for universal education.

Options:
a. Focus more on teaching songs than skills.
b. Create a supportive environment that encourages learning.
c. Only use traditional texts without any practical application.
d. Educate the bird alone in a separate room.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the educational goal: in "The Parrot's Tale" the aim is to help the bird learn useful behaviors and gain confidence, so the best approach supports learning, practice, and motivation.  
Step 2 — Compare options: a (focus only on songs) is too narrow and ignores broader skills; c (only traditional texts) is impractical for a bird that needs hands-on practice; d (teach alone in a separate room) risks isolation and reduces social learning.  
Step 3 — Choose the best option: b creates a supportive environment that encourages exploration, repetition, positive feedback, and gradual skill-building, which aligns with effective teaching principles.  
Therefore the correct answer is b, because it promotes learning outcomes and motivation while the other choices are either too limited, impractical, or harmful.

c. চাকরি পাওয়া
d. বিশ্রাম নেওয়া


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. প্রথমে "শিক্ষা" শব্দের সাধারণ সংজ্ঞা বিবেচনা করি: শিক্ষা হল জ্ঞান ও দক্ষতা অর্জনের প্রক্রিয়া, যা পাঠ্যবই পড়া, অনভিজ্ঞতা থেকে শেখা, অনুশীলন ও অভিজ্ঞতার মাধ্যমে ঘটে।
2. অপশনগুলো পরীক্ষা করলে (a) "শুধুমাত্র বই পড়া" — এটি অত্যন্ত সংকীর্ণ এবং শিক্ষার সব মাত্রাকে কভার করে না; (b) "জ্ঞান ও দক্ষতা অর্জনের প্রক্রিয়া" — এটি সম্পূর্ণ ও সঠিক সংজ্ঞা; (c) "চাকরি পাওয়া" — এটি শিক্ষার একটি সম্ভাব্য ফলাফল হতে পারে, কিন্তু সংজ্ঞা নয়; (d) "বিশ্রাম নেওয়া" — শিক্ষার সঙ্গে সম্পর্কহীন।
3. তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো (b) — জ্ঞান ও দক্ষতা অর্জনের প্রক্রিয়া।

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
গল্পের মূল বার্তা নির্ণয়ের জন্য প্রথমে গল্পের ঘটনার ধরন ও নায়কের আচরণ বিশ্লেষণ করতে হবে। গল্পে প্যারটের শিখন‑অভিজ্ঞতা কেবল বইয়ে পড়া নয় বরং বাস্তবে সেই জ্ঞান ব্যবহার করতেই কেন্দ্রিয়—এই কারণে শিক্ষার প্রকৃত মূল্য বাস্তব জীবনে প্রয়োগে প্রকাশ পায়। অতএব মূল বার্তা হলো শিক্ষার ব্যবহারিকতা, তাই সঠিক উত্তর: খ।

কেন অন্যান্যগুলি ভুল:
- ক গল্পটি "পাখিরা কখনো কথা বলে না" বলছে না—প্যারট কথাতে বা অনুকরণে সক্ষম;  
- গ "রাজা সবসময় সঠিক" এই ধরনের সার্বজনীন দাবি গল্পের বিষয় নয়;

Options:
a. ভালো ফলাফল
b. প্রকৃত জ্ঞান ও দক্ষতা
c. বন্ধু
d. খেলা


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: প্রশ্নের উদ্দেশ্য বোঝা — যদি কেউ কেবল পরীক্ষার নম্বর বাড়ানোর জন্য রটতি করে পড়ে, তাহলে সে পঠনবিষয়ক গভীর বোঝাপড়া অর্জন করে না এবং সমস্যা সমাধানের ক্ষমতা গড়ে ওঠে না।  
Step 2: ফলাফল বিশ্লেষণ — পরীক্ষার জন্য পড়লে অস্থায়ী স্মৃতি বাড়ে তাই পরীক্ষায় ভালো ফল আনা সম্ভব, কিন্তু স্থায়ী জ্ঞান ও দক্ষতা তৈরি হয় না। তাই প্রধান ক্ষতি হচ্ছে প্রকৃত জ্ঞান ও দক্ষতা হারানো।  
Step 3: অন্যান্য অপশন তুলনা — a (ভালো ফলাফল): সম্ভবত লাভ হবে; c (বন্ধু) ও d (খেলা): সরাসরি সম্পর্কিত নয় বা প্রত্যাবর্তনযোগ্য। 

সঠিক উত্তর: b (প্রকৃত জ্ঞান ও দক্ষতা) — কারণ কেবল পরীক্ষার জন্য পড়লে জ্ঞানের গভীরতা ও ব্যবহারিক দক্ষতা অর্জিত হয় না।

Question:
"শিক্ষা" এর সাথে "জীবন" এর সম্পর্ক কি?

Options:
a. শিক্ষা ও জীবন আলাদা
b. শিক্ষা জীবনকে গঠন করে
c. জীবন শিক্ষা ছাড়া সম্ভব
d. শিখা গেলেই জীবন চলে


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) ধাপ ১ — বিশ্লেষণ: "শিক্ষা" মানে জ্ঞান, দক্ষতা ও মূল্যবোধ অর্জন; "জীবন" মানে ব্যক্তির দৈনন্দিন ক্রিয়া, সিদ্ধান্ত ও সামাজিক সম্পর্ক।  
2) ধাপ ২ — তুলনা ও সিদ্ধান্ত: শিক্ষা মানুষের চিন্তা, আচরণ ও সক্ষমতা গড়ে তোলে, ফলে জীবনকে গঠন ও উন্নত করে। তাই (b) "শিক্ষা জীবনকে গঠন করে" সঠিক।  
3) ধাপ ৩ — অন্য বিকল্পগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত ভুল ব্যাখ্যা: (a) ভুল — শিক্ষা ও জীবন আলাদা নয়, তারা আন্তঃসম্পর্কিত; (c) ভুল — শারীরিকভাবে জীবন থাকতে পারে কিন্তু অর্থবোধক ও দক্ষ জীবন কঠিন হবে শিক্ষা ছাড়াই; (d) ভুল — "শিখা গেলেই জীবন চলে" অতিরঞ্জিত এবং অসঠিকভাবে ব্যক্ত করেছে যে কেবল শিখলেই সকল কিছু হয়ে যাবে।

b. এটি আমাদের শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থার সমস্যাগুলি তুলে ধরে
c. এটি গল্পের মতো, বাস্তব নয়
d. এটি শিক্ষার্থীদের মনোযোগ নেয়


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে প্রশ্নে মূল থিম শনাক্ত করতে হবে — গল্পটি শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থার উপর কী বার্তা দেয়। ধাপে ধাপে বিশ্লেষণ:

1. গল্পের কেন্দ্রবিন্দু সাধারণত শিক্ষার সমস্যা, দুর্বলতা বা সংস্কারগত প্রস্তাব তুলে ধরা হলে তা বাস্তবসম্মত সমালোচনা হিসেবে কাজ করে। তাই b ("এটি আমাদের শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থার সমস্যাগুলি তুলে ধরে") সঠিক উত্তর।  
2. বাকি অপশনগুলোর কারণে বাতিলকরণ: a ("শুধুমাত্র শিক্ষকদের উপকার করে") — এটি অত্যন্ত সীমিত এবং গল্পের সমালোচনামূলক বিষয়ের সঙ্গে মিল রাখে না; c ("গল্পের মতো, বাস্তব নয়") — যদিও সাহিত্যকর্ম কাল্পনিক হতে পারে, অনেক সময় বাস্তবসম্মত সমস্যা তুলে ধরে; d ("এটি শিক্ষার্থীদের মনোযোগ নেয়") — গল্পটি মনোযোগ আকর্ষণ করতে পারে, কিন্তু প্রধান উদ্দেশ্য শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থার সমস্যা নির্দেশ করাই। 

অতএব সঠিক উত্তর: b.

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the core aim of education — to equip learners with the ability to understand, analyze, and make reasoned judgments rather than only recalling information.  
Step 2: Compare options by this criterion: ক memorizing facts is a limited skill and only a tool; খ developing critical thinking directly builds understanding, problem-solving, and lifelong learning; গ getting good grades is an outcome or measurement, not the fundamental purpose; ঘ socializing is a useful byproduct but not the main educational aim.

How can education improve our community?

Options:

b. By increasing crime rates.
c. By making people more competitive.
d. By helping individuals contribute positively.


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — "improve our community" means looking for the option that leads to overall social benefit, cooperation, and positive change.  
Step 2: Evaluate each choice: education gives people knowledge, skills, civic awareness and problem-solving ability, which enables them to participate in community service, make informed decisions, and drive social improvements — this matches option d.  
Step 3: Rule out others briefly: (a) can be a side effect but is not the main community benefit; (b) is clearly wrong because education tends to reduce crime; (c) competitiveness may help some individuals but does not necessarily improve the whole community.  
Therefore the correct answer is d.

Question:
If you were the King in "The Parrot's Tale," how would you change the way the bird was educated?

Options:
a. Focus on practical learning instead of just theory.
b. Make the cage larger.
c. Hire more teachers.
d. Provide better food.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Step 1: Identify the core problem — the parrot in the tale was taught mainly by rote/theory, so it didn’t learn useful, applicable skills.  
Step 2: Choose the option that targets that problem: option (a) "Focus on practical learning instead of just theory" directly addresses the lack of hands-on, contextual teaching.  
Step 3: Reasoning — practical learning (learning by doing, imitation, real-life practice) suits a parrot’s natural abilities and leads to better retention and useful behavior, so it would improve the bird’s education more than other changes.  
Step 4: Why other options fail — making the cage larger (b) affects space but not teaching method; hiring more teachers (c) won’t help if the approach remains theoretical; better food (d) improves health but does not change how the bird learns. Therefore the correct choice is (a).

b. It cannot recite scriptures
c. It lives in a cage

Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the textual clue — the story explicitly describes the parrot as unable to recite scriptures or holy texts, which is the direct reason it’s labeled uneducated.  
Step 2: Eliminate other options — (a) singing, (c) living in a cage, and (d) eating fruit are behaviors mentioned or possible circumstances but are not given as the cause of being uneducated.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: It cannot recite scriptures.

Options:

b. By enabling better job opportunities
c. By gaining respect from others
d. By helping them memorize facts


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the question — "help in daily life" means practical, long-term benefits like income, problem-solving, and stability.  
Step 2: Compare options: option b (better job opportunities) directly improves a person's livelihood, income, and ability to meet daily needs, so it most clearly helps day-to-day life.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out others — option a (passing exams) is short-term and limited; option c (gaining respect) is social but not necessarily practical; option d (memorizing facts) is a narrow skill and doesn’t guarantee useful abilities.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

What lesson can we learn from the parrot's story regarding education?

Options:
a. Education is only about reading books
b. Education should be more than just physical appearance
c. Education is not necessary for happiness
d. Education can be ignored if one is talented


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution: The parrot’s story emphasizes that true education is about knowledge, character and manners, not just how someone looks or sounds. Step 1: Match this moral to the options — option b ("Education should be more than just physical appearance") directly reflects that idea. Step 2: Reject the others: option a is too narrow (education ≠ only reading books), option c is false because education often contributes to understanding and well-being, and option d wrongly suggests talent alone removes the need for learning. Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
If the bird had received proper education, what might have happened?

Options:
a. It would have been freed
b. It would have become a famous singer
c. It would have been able to help others
d. It would have continued to live in a cage


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
This is a third‑conditional (past unreal) sentence: "If the bird had received proper education, it would have ...", so we look for the likely positive result of that unreal past condition. Option c ("It would have been able to help others") best matches the expected consequence of receiving proper education — education enabling capability to assist others. 

Why others are incorrect: option a (freed) is not a necessary result of education, option b (become a famous singer) is too specific and not implied by “proper education,” and option d (continued to live in a cage) contradicts the hypothetical improvement implied by the condition. Hence option c is correct.

What is the main message of the proverb, "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"?

Options:
a. It is better to give than to receive.
b. Education is more valuable than temporary assistance.
c. People should always be self-reliant.
d. Fish is a vital source of food.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish meets an immediate need, while teaching to fish provides a lasting skill.  
Step 2: The core message emphasizes lasting benefit through education or skill-building rather than one-time aid.  
Step 3: Therefore option b ("Education is more valuable than temporary assistance") matches the proverb best.  
Why others are incorrect: a focuses on giving vs receiving (not about teaching), c overgeneralizes to constant self-reliance (the proverb highlights enabling through skill), and d reads the proverb literally about fish instead of its metaphorical meaning.

c. The bird should learn manners.
d. The bird makes a lot of noise.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:

Why did the King in "The Parrot’s Tale" consider the bird useless initially?

Options:
a. Because it could not sing well
b. Because it did not follow royal commands
c. Because it could not recite scripture
d. Because it was always caged


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the king’s expectation — in the story the king valued a bird that could recite holy scriptures and teach piety.  
Step 2: Compare the parrot’s ability — the parrot could mimic sounds or sing, but it could not recite scripture as the king wanted.  
Step 3: Conclusion — therefore the king initially considered the bird useless because it could not recite scripture, so option (c) is correct.

Briefly why the others are incorrect: (a) Singing alone wasn’t the king’s main criterion; (b) There’s no emphasis that it disobeyed royal commands; (d) Being caged was a condition, not the reason the king judged it useless.

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the core criterion — choose a skill that gives the greatest immediate and universal benefit to an uneducated person.  
Step 2: Evaluate each option against that criterion: cooking directly addresses daily nutrition and independence, gardening and sewing are useful but less universally accessible or immediately necessary, and driving requires resources, licensing, and infrastructure.  
Step 3: Conclude that option (a) is best because the ability to prepare safe, nutritious food meets a basic human need and can be started with minimal formal education or equipment.  

Explanation of why others are less suitable:
- (b) Gardening is relaxing and valuable but needs land/space and time to yield food.  
- (c) Sewing is a useful traditional skill but not as critical for daily survival.  
- (d) Driving can increase mobility but often requires cost, training, and legal permissions, so it’s not as immediately practical.

Question:
How can education impact a community positively? Choose the best example.

Options:
a. By ensuring only a few people get jobs
b. By increasing people's ability to help each other
c. By making everyone compete for grades
d. By focusing only on theory without practice


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the goal — we want the option that shows a clear positive effect of education on a community.  
Step 2: Evaluate each choice briefly:
- a is incorrect because restricting jobs to only a few people harms economic wellbeing and equality.  
- c is incorrect because making everyone compete for grades can increase stress and reduce cooperation.  
- d is incorrect because focusing only on theory without practice reduces education’s real-world usefulness.  
Step 3: Choose the best option — b is correct because increasing people’s ability to help each other builds cooperation, social capital, and collective problem-solving, which directly benefits the whole community.

Question:
Compare the outcomes of the King's approach to educating the parrot with a more practical teaching method. Which would yield better results and why?

Options:
a. The King's approach, because it looks impressive
b. The practical method, because it allows for real learning
c. Both approaches yield the same results
d. Neither approach is effective


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Define effective teaching criteria: measurable learning requires active practice, repetition, reinforcement, and feedback.  
Step 2 — Compare approaches: the King's approach may look impressive (showy demonstration) but is likely passive and does not give the parrot repeated practice or corrective feedback; the practical method emphasizes gradual training, reinforcement, and opportunities to practice.  
Step 3 — Conclusion: the practical method yields better results because it produces genuine learning through repetition and feedback, so option (b) is correct.  
Why the others are wrong: (a) values appearance over learning, (c) is false because methods differ in effectiveness, and (d) is false because a well-designed practical method is effective.

1. প্রথমে তাদের শিক্ষা সমস্যা ও চাহিদা মূল্যায়ন করব—দক্ষতা, আগ্রহ এবং বাধা চিহ্নিত করা।  
2. তারপর বাস্তব লক্ষ্য নির্ধারণ করে ছোট-ছোট পাঠ পরিকল্পনা বানাব (তত্ত্ব + ব্যবহারিক)।  
3. প্রতিটি পাঠে হাতে-কলমে অনুশীলন করাব এবং পর্যবেক্ষণ ও প্রতিক্রিয়া দেব যাতে তারা ত্রুটি থেকে শিখতে পারে।  
4. অগ্রগতি পরিমাপ করে প্রয়োজনমতো পাঠক্রম সামঞ্জস্য করব এবং উৎসাহিত করব।  

কারণ: হাতে-কলমে অনুশীলন (অভিজ্ঞতা) শেখার কার্যকারিতা বৃদ্ধি করে এবং মূল্যায়ন-ভিত্তিক সমর্থন দেয়—এই কারণেই সঠিক উত্তর b (Assess their needs and provide hands-on practice)। অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ: (a) শুধুমাত্র তত্ত্ব দিলে ব্যবহারিক দক্ষতা থাকবে না, (c) একা ছেড়ে দিলে প্রয়োজনীয় সহায়তা মেলে না, এবং (d) শুধুমাত্র তাদের ইচ্ছা শেখালে মৌলিক দক্ষতা বা প্রয়োজনীয় ধারণা বাদ পড়তে পারে।

What does the proverb 'Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed them for a lifetime' mean?

Options:
a. Education is only about memorizing facts.
b. Teaching skills is more beneficial than just providing resources.
c. It is better to work alone than to help others.
d. Money is more important than knowledge.

Step 2: Compare this meaning with the choices and select the one that matches: option b states that teaching skills is more beneficial than just providing resources, which matches the proverb.  
Step 3: Why the others are incorrect — option a is wrong because the proverb emphasizes skills and independence, not rote memorization; option c is wrong because the proverb encourages empowering others, not isolation; option d is wrong because it values knowledge/skill over mere money.

Options:

Solution:
Step 1: Identify contextual clues in the story (mentions of a king/queen, throne, courtiers or palace rooms) that indicate the setting is a royal environment.  
Step 2: Use those clues to choose the option that matches — a royal palace — because the narrative elements (royal characters and palace details) are explicitly present.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the king’s likely motive from the context — what benefit would educating a bird bring to the kingdom or the market.  
Step 2: Choose the option that matches a practical, economic motive: educating the bird would make it more attractive or useful to buyers, thereby increasing market demand and profits. Hence option (c) is correct.  
Explanation why others are wrong: (a) and (b) focus on personal improvements (singing or manners) that don't explain a king’s market-oriented decision, and (d) entertaining friends is a social motive rather than an economic one.

How can education impact a community?

Options:
a. By keeping knowledge to oneself.
b. By promoting ignorance and laziness.
c. By inspiring individuals to improve their lives and society.
d. By increasing competition among students.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question and identify the core idea—how education affects a community. Education typically increases knowledge, skills, critical thinking, and civic awareness, which lead to social and economic improvements.

Step 2: Evaluate each option against that idea. Option (c) — "By inspiring individuals to improve their lives and society" — matches the positive, constructive effects of education, so it is correct.

Step 3: Briefly reject the others. Option (a) is incorrect because keeping knowledge to oneself contradicts the sharing and empowerment role of education. Option (b) is wrong because education reduces ignorance and encourages effort, not laziness. Option (d) is not the best answer: while competition can occur, it is not the primary way education benefits a community.

Options:
a. Less interaction between teachers and students.
b. More focus on standardized testing.
c. Greater emphasis on collaborative learning and emotional support.
d. More expensive resources and tools.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Compare: the story’s methods emphasize interaction, collaboration, and emotional support, while many modern classrooms lean toward lecture, individual performance, and standardized assessment. Step 2 — Identify improvement: an effective system would incorporate group work, teacher-student dialogue, and attention to students’ emotional and social needs. Step 3 — Match to options: option c (“Greater emphasis on collaborative learning and emotional support”) directly captures these improvements, so it is correct. Step 4 — Why others are wrong: option a reduces valuable interaction; option b increases reliance on testing rather than learning; option d (more expensive resources) may help but does not address teaching approach or student well-being.

What does the proverb "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime" mean?

Options:
a. Providing immediate help is better than teaching skills.
b. Education is less important than daily needs.
c. Teaching skills ensures long-term success.
d. Fishing is the only important skill to learn.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
The proverb contrasts a one-time gift (giving a fish) with teaching a lasting skill (teaching to fish): the first meets an immediate need, the second creates ongoing self-sufficiency. Hence the correct choice is c: "Teaching skills ensures long-term success," because learning a skill lets a person provide for themselves indefinitely. Options a and b are wrong because they favor short-term aid or dismiss education, and d is incorrect because the proverb is metaphorical, not literally valuing only fishing.

Question:
Who is associated with the story "The Parrot's Tale"?

Options:
a. Kazi Nazrul Islam
b. Rabindranath Tagore
c. Satyajit Ray
d. Michael Madhusudan Dutt


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the original title — "The Parrot's Tale" is the English translation of Rabindranath Tagore’s Bengali children’s story "Tota Kahini".  
Step 2: Match this to the options — that identifies option b (Rabindranath Tagore) as the correct answer.  
Explanation: Kazi Nazrul Islam, Satyajit Ray, and Michael Madhusudan Dutt are noted for other works and genres (Nazrul for revolutionary poetry, Ray for films and some fiction, Dutt for epic and romantic poetry), but the specific children’s tale "Tota Kahini"/"The Parrot's Tale" is by Rabindranath Tagore.

Question:
Why did the King order the education of the bird in "The Parrot's Tale"?

Options:
a. The bird was beautiful.
b. The bird could sing well.
c. The bird was a royal pet.
d. The bird's ignorance harmed the kingdom's market.


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
1. The story shows the parrot spreading false or ignorant statements that upset traders and caused disorder in the marketplace, so the king ordered its education to stop that harm.  
2. Reasoning: the king’s motive is practical—to prevent further damage to the kingdom’s market and commerce—so educating the bird would remove the source of misleading talk.  
3. Why other options are wrong: option (a) the bird’s beauty is irrelevant to the king’s decision; (b) its singing ability isn’t presented as a problem needing correction; (c) merely being a royal pet wouldn’t by itself require education unless it caused harm.  
Therefore the correct answer is d.

Question:
In the context of education, how can we compare traditional learning with modern technology-based learning?

Options:
a. Traditional learning is always better.
b. Technology-based learning lacks personal touch.
c. Both have their unique advantages and disadvantages.
d. Modern learning is only for urban students.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read each option and test it against the general evidence about learning methods.  
Step 2: Evaluate options:
- Option a claims an absolute superiority of traditional learning — this is too strong because traditional methods have strengths (face-to-face interaction, social skills) but also limitations (fixed pace, limited resources).  
- Option b points out a real issue: some technology-based learning can feel less personal, but many tech tools (video calls, adaptive platforms) can be highly interactive and personalized.  
- Option d wrongly generalizes that modern learning is only for urban students; in fact, technology can reach rural areas (e.g., mobile learning, offline resources) though access may vary.  
Conclusion: Option c is correct because it acknowledges that both traditional and technology-based learning have unique advantages and disadvantages, so a balanced comparison best reflects reality.

Question:
How does the story of the parrot reflect on the theme of education?

Options:
a. Education should only focus on appearances.
b. True education requires practical understanding.
c. Education can be harmful in all cases.
d. Knowledge is less important than wealth.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the theme — the parrot story contrasts mere outward learning (mimicry or appearances) with real, useful understanding.  
Step 2: The parrot’s behavior shows that knowing facts or showing off does not help unless one understands and can apply knowledge in real situations, so the story advocates practical understanding.  
Therefore the correct answer is b: True education requires practical understanding.  
Other options are wrong because (a) limits education to appearances which the story criticizes, (c) wrongly claims education is always harmful, and (d) wrongly ranks wealth above knowledge, neither of which fit the story’s lesson.

2) ধাপ ২: বিকল্প পরিস্থিতি—যদি পাখিটিকে যথাযথ যত্ন ও শিক্ষা দেওয়া হত, তাহলে তার মানসিক বিকাশ, সামাজিক দক্ষতা ও ভাষাগত প্রতিক্রিয়া উন্নত হতো এবং সে শান্তিপূর্ণভাবে পরিবেশের সঙ্গে খাপ খাইয়ে নিয়ে কার্যকরভাবে যোগাযোগ করতে পারত।  
3) ধাপ ৩: বিকল্পগুলোর তুলনা — বিকল্প c ("The bird would have thrived and communicated effectively") সরাসরি উপরের অনুমানের সঙ্গে মিলে; a খুব নির্দিষ্ট ও অনিশ্চিত (সকল শিক্ষিত পাখি ‘দারুণ গায়ক’ হবে না), b বিপরীত এবং অযৌক্তিক, এবং d অপ্রাসঙ্গিক কারণ ভাল শিক্ষা সাধারণত বিভ্রান্তি বাড়ায় না।

Question:
What is the main idea of the proverb, "Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime?"

Options:
a. Teaching is more important than providing.
b. Fishing is the best way to survive.
c. People should only receive food.
d. Education is not necessary.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: The proverb contrasts short-term aid with long-term empowerment — giving a fish feeds someone for a day, while teaching them to fish enables lifelong self-sufficiency. Therefore the central idea is that teaching (or enabling skills) is more important than merely providing immediate help, so option a is correct. Options b, c, and d are incorrect because (b) takes the metaphor literally, (c) contradicts the proverb’s emphasis on learning rather than only receiving, and (d) states the opposite of the proverb’s message.

Why did the King want to educate the bird in "The Parrot's Tale"?

Options:
a. The bird was a source of entertainment.
b. The bird could bring profit to the royal market.
c. The bird could sing beautifully.
d. The bird was favored by the King.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the story’s detail about the king’s motive — he trained the bird so it would have value in the market and bring income.  
Step 2: Therefore the primary reason matches option (b): the bird could bring profit to the royal market.  
Why the others are wrong: (a) Although the bird could entertain, the story emphasizes monetary gain, not mere amusement; (c) the king’s aim was profit, not the bird’s singing ability; (d) if the bird were simply favored, there would be no need to educate it for sale. Hence the correct answer is (b).

a. It is a valuable creature.
b. It is of no use.
c. It sings beautifully.
d. It is wise and knowledgeable.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the relevant line in the story: the king inspects the bird and dismisses it at first. From that passage we infer his initial judgment.
2. Reasoning: the king treats the parrot as useless because it does not appear to serve any obvious purpose (it neither performs a useful task nor pleases him). Therefore the correct choice is b: "It is of no use."
3. Why other options are wrong: a (valuable) contradicts his dismissal; c (sings beautifully) and d (wise and knowledgeable) are not supported by his initial reaction, which is one of disregard rather than admiration.

Step 1: Determine what civic engagement aims for — increasing public awareness, participation, and collective action to address community problems.  
Step 2: Compare options: option (c) “raising awareness of social issues” directly supports these aims by informing residents, encouraging discussion, and motivating collective solutions, so it matches civic engagement principles. Options (a) “offering entertainment” and (b) “promoting individual success” do not primarily build collective civic capacity, and (d) “providing free resources” can help but does not by itself foster awareness or engagement.

Question:
If the bird in "The Parrot's Tale" could speak, what might it say about its education experience?

Options:
a. "I am very happy with my fancy cage."
b. "I miss singing and flying freely."
c. "Education is not important to me."
d. "I enjoy learning many texts."


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the story’s depiction — the bird was trained to recite human texts but in the process lost its natural singing and freedom.  
Step 2: From that, the bird’s likely feeling is regret and longing for its lost freedom, so it would say something like “I miss singing and flying freely,” which matches option b.  
Why others are wrong: Option a (happy with a fancy cage) contradicts the bird’s loss of freedom; option c (education is not important) ignores that the bird was forced into education but suffered for it; option d (I enjoy learning many texts) conflicts with the story’s emphasis on lost joy and natural song.

Question:
In 'The Parrot’s Tale,' what was the primary purpose of educating the bird?

Options:
a. To teach it to sing beautifully
b. To ensure it stops eating fruits
c. To enhance its overall value as a creature
d. To provide it with a lavish cage


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the bird’s stated purpose for education in the story — the narrator explains that the bird was taught manners, speech, and useful behaviours to make it more valuable and respectable.  
Step 2: Match that purpose to the options: “to enhance its overall value as a creature” directly corresponds to improving its worth through education.  
Therefore the correct answer is (c).

Explanation of other options: (a) teaching it to sing beautifully is a limited, specific skill and not the main goal; (b) stopping it from eating fruits is not an educational aim in the text; (d) providing a lavish cage is about environment, not about educating the bird.

What consequence did excessive focus on form over substance have on the bird's education?

Options:
a. The bird learned to recite scriptures
b. The bird became healthier
c. The bird eventually died
d. The bird learned to interact better with others


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the stem — excessive focus on form over substance means attention was given to outward appearances or rituals while essential needs or real learning were neglected.  
Step 2: From that premise the logical consequence is that the bird’s true well‑being and proper care were ignored, so it suffered fatal consequences; hence the correct answer is (c) the bird eventually died.  
Step 3: Options (a) and (d) imply positive educational outcomes which contradict “substance” being neglected, and (b) (became healthier) is the opposite of the expected result when essential needs are ignored.

Options:
a. He provided the bird with a better diet
b. He constructed a decorative cage
c. He taught the bird to fly again
d. He composed music for the bird to sing to


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Read the passage and identify the goldsmith's actions—he worked with metal and made objects for display. Since the goldsmith's skill set matches crafting items, the action "constructed a decorative cage" corresponds directly to his role. The other options (providing diet, teaching to fly, composing music) describe feeding, training, or musical skills that are not typical of a goldsmith, so the correct answer is b.

Options:
a. He believed the bird had learned to sing
b. He was pleased with the innovative teaching methods
c. He saw the lack of actual learning
d. He decided to build more cages for other birds


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Observe what happened during the King's visit — he inspected the bird classroom and watched the birds and their instruction.  
Step 2: From his observations he noticed the birds were not actually singing or demonstrating acquired skills; the setup was more appearance than real learning.  
Conclusion: therefore he perceived a lack of actual learning, so option (c) is correct.

Explanation of other options:  
- (a) is incorrect because he did not conclude the bird had learned to sing.  
- (b) is incorrect because he was not impressed by the teaching as effective.  
- (d) is incorrect because he did not decide to build more cages; his reaction pointed to concern about the absence of learning rather than expansion.

Options:
a. The importance of traditional learning methods
b. The dangers of neglecting emotional aspects of education
c. The effectiveness of rigorous memorization techniques
d. The necessity of combining education with practical skills


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the story’s emphasis — "The Parrot’s Tale" highlights how the parrot’s feelings, bonds, and emotional needs affect its learning and behavior.  
Step 2: Match that emphasis to the choices — this directly corresponds to option b, which states the dangers of neglecting emotional aspects of education.  
Briefly, the other options are incorrect because a (traditional learning) and c (rigorous memorization) focus on methods not emotions, and d (combining education with practical skills) emphasizes practicality rather than the story’s emotional neglect theme.

Question:
What did the royal scholars conclude about the bird's ignorance?

Options:
a. It was due to a lack of food.
b. It needed a proper cage.
c. It was too old to learn.
d. It was naturally ignorant.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: The scholars observed the bird's behavior and considered possible causes (hunger, environment, age, or innate inability). They concluded it was due to lack of a proper cage because the bird’s actions changed when placed in a suitable enclosure, showing that its problems were environmental rather than biological. This rules out (a) — lack of food — since feeding did not remove the ignorance, and (c) — being too old — because the bird responded to the changed surroundings; (d) — naturally ignorant — is contradicted by the improvement under proper conditions. Therefore the correct choice is (b).

Step 1: Read the question and compare each option to what the passage emphasizes.

সমাধান: প্রথম ধাপে প্রশ্নের শেষ অংশ বা শেষ বিবরণ পর্যবেক্ষণ করলে সেখানে পাখিটিকে বাঁচতে বা উড়তে না পারা এবং শেষ অবধি প্রাণহীন অবস্থায় পাওয়া যাওয়ার কথা বলা আছে, তাই এটি মারা যায়—অর্থাৎ গ। দ্বিতীয় ধাপে অন্যান্য অপশনগুলো বাতিল করা যায়: ক (উড়তে শিখেছে)–এর জন্য কোনও প্রশিক্ষণ বা সফল উড়ানের উল্লেখ নেই; খ (খুব জ্ঞানী হয়ে গেছে)–এর জন্য কোনো বুদ্ধিবৃত্তিক পরিবর্তনের সুস্পষ্ট প্রমাণ নেই; ঘ (পলায়ন করেছে)–এর জন্য পাখিটির পালিয়ে যাওয়ার তথ্য নেই। অতএব সঠিক উত্তর হলো গ (It died)।

Question:
What role do EdTech companies play in education?

Options:
a. They replace teachers.
b. They provide funding for schools.
c. They develop AI tools for classrooms.
d. They monitor student behavior.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the option meanings and identify the typical activities of EdTech companies: they design and deliver technology for learning (platforms, apps, analytics, and increasingly AI-driven tools).
2. Compare each option to that role:
   - a is incorrect: EdTech generally augments teachers’ work rather than fully replacing them.
   - b is incorrect: providing funding is not the main role of EdTech companies (that’s more a role for governments, donors, or investors).
   - c is correct: many EdTech companies develop AI tools for classrooms (adaptive learning, automated grading, personalized tutoring).
   - d is misleading: while some tools include analytics that can track engagement, “monitor student behavior” is neither their primary nor sole role.
3. Therefore the best choice is c.

Question:
What is one advantage of AI in education?

Options:
a. It can completely replace teachers.
b. It provides personalized learning experiences.
c. It requires no human interaction.
d. It is inexpensive to implement.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the options and identify which describes a realistic advantage of AI in education.  
Step 2: Evaluate each option:
- Option a is incorrect because AI can assist teachers but cannot fully replace the variety of human roles (motivation, emotional support, classroom management).  
- Option c is incorrect because AI systems usually require human interaction for guidance, oversight, and contextual judgment.  
- Option d is incorrect because implementing AI often involves significant costs for software, hardware, and training.  
Step 3: Option b is correct because AI can analyze a learner’s performance and adapt content, pace, and feedback to individual needs, thereby providing personalized learning experiences.

Question:
According to the text, what is a concern regarding AI in classrooms?

Options:
a. It can grade assignments quickly.
b. It may lead to privacy issues.
c. It enhances creativity in students.
d. It requires no training.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the phrase in the text that describes a negative consequence of AI in classrooms — the text mentions privacy concerns (data handling, student information risk).  
Step 2: Match that concern to the options: option b ("It may lead to privacy issues") directly states the concern.  
Step 3: Check other options and rule them out: option a (grading quickly) and option c (enhances creativity) describe benefits, not concerns; option d ("requires no training") is unlikely and not presented as the text's concern.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Options:
a. Only volunteering.
b. Working for community improvement.
c. Studying in schools.
d. Participating in sports.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Civic engagement means active participation in public life aimed at improving the community or addressing public issues (e.g., volunteering, advocacy, voting, community organizing).  
Step 2: Compare options: (a) "Only volunteering" is too narrow because civic engagement includes many activities besides volunteering; (c) "Studying in schools" is primarily education, not direct community action; (d) "Participating in sports" is typically recreational and not inherently civic.  
Therefore the best choice is b: Working for community improvement. Correct answer: b.

Question:
What is the difference between volunteerism and civic engagement?

Options:
a. Volunteerism is always planned.
b. Civic engagement is spontaneous.
c. Volunteerism is part of academic programs.
d. Civic engagement is often unplanned.


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Define terms — volunteerism normally refers to organized acts of service where people sign up or commit to help, while civic engagement includes a broader range of public participation (e.g., protests, voting, community actions) that can be either organized or spontaneous.  
Step 2: Compare choices — saying civic engagement is often unplanned matches the idea that many civic actions arise spontaneously (grassroots protests, sudden community responses).  
Step 3: Eliminate incorrect options — (a) is wrong because volunteerism is not always planned; (b) is wrong because civic engagement can also be organized; (c) is wrong because volunteerism may be part of academic programs but that is not its defining difference.  

Answer: d.

What was Alex's motivation for helping the Romanian people?

Options:
a. He wanted to win a prize.
b. He felt ashamed of his comfort.
c. He was asked by his teacher.
d. He wanted to travel.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the stated motivation — the text indicates Alex helped because he felt ashamed of his own comfortable situation and wanted to respond to the plight of the Romanian people.

Step 2: Eliminate other choices — winning a prize (a) is not mentioned, being asked by a teacher (c) is not given as a reason, and wanting to travel (d) conflicts with the moral/emotional motive described.

Step 3: Conclude that the correct answer is (b) he felt ashamed of his comfort, since that directly matches the reason provided in the passage.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the statement carefully and identify the specific aid mentioned — the students provided immediate relief items.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that description: option b ("food and hygiene supplies") matches typical immediate relief items, while option a (clothing and toys) is partly relief but less likely if the passage emphasized essentials; option c (shelter and education) refers to longer-term support; option d (medical assistance) would be explicitly stated if true.

What is one of the main themes of 'The Parrot's Tale'?

Options:
a. The importance of material wealth.
b. The value of true education.
c. The significance of friendship.
d. The need for freedom.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central lesson of the story by noting the protagonist’s transformation and the author’s repeated emphasis — the parrot’s growth comes from learning and moral guidance rather than possessions or mere companionship.  
Step 2: Match that central lesson to the options: this clearly corresponds to the value of true education, which is presented as the means for the parrot’s improvement.  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices: material wealth (a) is not emphasized as important; friendship (c) and freedom (d) may appear but are not the story’s primary moral.  

Therefore the correct answer is b: The value of true education.

What was the setting of Totto-chan's school?

Options:
a. A traditional building.

c. A large mansion.
d. An outdoor park.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: In Tetsuko Kuroyanagi’s book "Totto-chan: The Little Girl at the Window," the school was uniquely housed in a series of converted railroad cars. Step 1: The narrative and descriptions repeatedly mention classrooms that were old train cars arranged on the school grounds. Step 2: Therefore option b ("a series of railroad cars") is correct. The other choices are incorrect because the school is neither a traditional building, a large mansion, nor an outdoor park—those settings contradict the clear depiction of train-car classrooms in the book.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Step 1: Read the question and identify the keyword "challenge regarding AI in education."  
Step 2: Evaluate each option: (a) "too easy to use" is not typically a challenge; (c) "not effective" is not generally true and is context-dependent; (d) "requires no training" is false because effective use of AI usually needs teacher training.  
Step 3: Recognize that a common concern is automation causing job displacement or reduced roles for teachers, which matches (b).

Options:
a. শিক্ষা শুধুমাত্র পরীক্ষার ফলাফল অর্জনের জন্য জরুরি, প্রযুক্তির কোনো প্রয়োজন নেই।
b. শিক্ষা এবং প্রযুক্তি উভয়ই শিক্ষার্থীদের অভিজ্ঞতাকে সমৃদ্ধ করতে পারে, তবে প্রযুক্তির ব্যবহার সঠিকভাবে করতে হবে।
c. প্রযুক্তি শিক্ষার বিকল্প হতে পারে যা শিক্ষককে অপ্রয়োজনীয় করে দেয়।
d. শিক্ষার উদ্দেশ্য শুধুমাত্র চাকরি পাওয়া, প্রযুক্তি এর সাথে সম্পর্কিত নয়।


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. ধাপে ধাপে চিন্তা: গল্প দুটিই শিক্ষার গুরুত্বকে উচ্চ মূল্য দেয় — একদিকে জ্ঞান, নৈতিকতা ও শেখার অনুষঙ্গ (The Parrot's Tale) এবং অন্যদিকে আধুনিক সময়ে শিক্ষা প্রক্রিয়াকে প্রযুক্তি সাহায্য করে কিভাবে (Education and Technology) তা তুলে ধরা হয়।  
2. তুলনামূলক বিশ্লেষণ: দুটোই দেখায় যে প্রযুক্তি নিজে লক্ষ্য নয় বরং শিক্ষাকে সমৃদ্ধ ও সহজতর করার একটি উপায়; সঠিক ব্যবহার থাকলে তা শিক্ষার্থীর অভিজ্ঞতা ও শেখার গুণমান বাড়ায়।  
3. সিদ্ধান্ত: তাই b সঠিক কারণ এটি বলে শিক্ষা ও প্রযুক্তি উভয়ই গুরুত্বপূর্ণ কিন্তু প্রযুক্তির খাপ খাওয়ানো ও সঠিক ব্যবহার অপরিহার্য।  
4. অন্য বিকল্পগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: a ও d অতিরিক্ত সংকীর্ণ — গল্পগুলো শিক্ষাকে কেবল পরীক্ষা বা চাকরির মাত্রা পর্যন্ত সীমাবদ্ধ করে না; c ভুল কারণ গল্পগুলো প্রযুক্তিকে শিক্ষককে বদলে দেয়নি বরং শিক্ষককে সহায়কারী হিসেবে দেখায়।

Question:
What is the main theme of 'The Parrot's Tale' by Rabindranath Tagore?

Options:
a. The importance of external appearances
b. The futility of education without understanding
c. The necessity of leisure in education
d. The benefits of teamwork in learning


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the story — the parrot can recite lessons and scriptures perfectly but has no understanding or freedom; his life is mechanical recitation without inner comprehension.  
Step 2: Identify the theme — Tagore criticizes mere rote learning and shows that education or knowledge without true understanding and inner freedom is useless.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options — external appearances (a) is not the focus; leisure in education (c) and teamwork (d) are not themes in this tale.

Question:
What type of educational work does 'The Parrot’s Tale' represent?

Options:
a. Tragedy
b. Satire
c. Comedy
d. Biography


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Determine the work’s tone and purpose — "The Parrot’s Tale" uses humor, irony and allegorical episodes to expose human follies and criticize social or moral problems.  
Step 2: Match those features to a genre — such use of ridicule and indirect moral criticism is characteristic of satire.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) Satire.  
Briefly why others are incorrect: tragedy focuses on serious suffering and downfall, comedy aims primarily for laughter without sustained moral criticism, and biography is a factual life account; none fit the allegorical, critical nature of "The Parrot’s Tale."

Options:
a. Education should focus solely on academic knowledge.
b. Education's true value is in teaching practical skills for life.
c. Education is only for the wealthy.
d. Education is about acquiring wealth and status.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central message of "The Parrot's Tale" — the story emphasizes how learning useful, everyday skills and wisdom helps the parrot survive and thrive.  
Step 2: Compare that message to the options: a narrows education to academics only, which contradicts the tale; c and d claim education is about wealth or exclusive privilege, which the story does not promote.  
Step 3: Conclude that option b best matches the theme because the tale highlights education’s practical value in real life rather than purely academic, wealthy, or status-based aims.

Therefore the correct answer is: b.

Options:
a. The bird sang beautifully.
b. The King realized the bird was neglected despite the efforts.
c. The bird learned to fly again.
d. The bird became the favorite of the court.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the scene in the story where the King inspects the bird’s education and observes its condition and progress.  
Step 2: The King notices that despite lessons and effort, the bird shows signs of neglect and lack of proper care; therefore he realizes the bird was neglected despite the efforts — this corresponds to option (b).  
Step 3: Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because the story does not emphasize the bird singing beautifully, regaining flight, or becoming the court’s favorite as the King’s principal conclusion; the key outcome is the King’s realization of neglect.

What is the ultimate goal of education as per the proverb mentioned in 'The Parrot's Tale'?

Options:
a. To gain wealth
b. To teach a person to fish
c. To pass exams
d. To memorize scriptures


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The proverb in "The Parrot's Tale" emphasizes making a person self-reliant—giving skills so they can support themselves (analogous to teaching someone to fish rather than handing them fish).  
Step 2: Option b ("To teach a person to fish") directly matches this idea of education aiming for independence and practical ability.  
Step 3: The other options are narrower or instrumental: gaining wealth, passing exams, or memorizing scriptures are possible outcomes but not the ultimate, broad goal implied by the proverb.

What does the proverb 'Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed him for a lifetime' emphasize about education?

Options:
a. Education is not important.
b. Education has short-term benefits.
c. Education should provide long-lasting skills.
d. Education is only for the wealthy.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the proverb — giving a fish meets an immediate need (short-term help), while teaching to fish gives a person the skill to provide for themselves repeatedly (long-term benefit).

Step 2: Match this interpretation to the options. The proverb emphasizes lasting ability and self-sufficiency, which corresponds to option (c): education should provide long-lasting skills.

Step 3: Eliminate other options: (a) is wrong because the proverb values a form of help (teaching), not dismissing education; (b) is wrong because it contrasts short-term aid with long-term training, so the emphasis is on long-term, not short-term benefits; (d) is wrong because the proverb applies universally, not only to the wealthy.

Therefore the correct answer is (c).
