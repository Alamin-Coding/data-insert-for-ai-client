Question:
What underlying theme can be derived from both the scientific studies of dreams and the literary perspectives of poets?

Options:
a. Dreams are primarily a source of anxiety and confusion.
b. Dreams offer a unique lens through which to explore human aspirations and fears.
c. Dreams should be ignored as they do not contribute to real-life outcomes.
d. Dreams only serve as entertainment without deeper significance.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: Step 1 — Identify the common focus: scientific studies analyze dreams to reveal unconscious processes, while poets use dreams to express hopes, fears, and inner longings. Step 2 — Compare options: a and d are too narrow (only anxiety or entertainment), and c dismisses dreams despite both science and literature treating them as meaningful. Therefore the best choice is (b): dreams offer a unique lens to explore human aspirations and fears, which captures the shared underlying theme.

a. Dreams are always a direct reflection of our daily experiences.
b. Dreams serve as a bridge between our subconscious desires and our conscious reality.
c. Dreams have no relation to reality and are purely fantastical.

Question:
In what way do the writings of poets like Hughes and Lawrence enhance our understanding of the significance of dreams?

Options:
a. They suggest that dreams are mere illusions without real-world implications.
b. They highlight the transformative power of dreams in shaping our actions and futures.
c. They encourage a dismissive attitude towards the importance of dreaming.
d. They focus on the psychological aspects of dreams rather than their emotional impact.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the poets' central message — Hughes and Lawrence often portray dreams as sources of longing, vision and motivation that push characters toward change.  
Step 2: Reasoning — their poems and prose link dreaming with inner transformation and the possibility of new actions or futures, showing dreams as active forces rather than empty images.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options — options a and c deny any real effect of dreams, which contradicts the poets’ treatment; option d narrows the focus to psychological explanation only, whereas the poets emphasize emotional and transformative impact as well.  
Conclusion: Therefore option b is correct because it best matches the poets’ depiction of dreams as transformative influences that shape actions and futures.

Question:
How does the quote from APJ Abdul Kalam relate to the notions of dreams discussed by Lawrence and Hughes?

Options:
a. It suggests that dreams are only valuable when they are realized.
b. It implies that dreams should be pursued with determination and dedication.
c. It indicates that dreams are not important unless they are written down.
d. It states that dreams can often be forgotten if not acted upon.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify Kalam’s main idea — he emphasizes that dreams must be actively pursued and turned into action through determination and hard work.  
Step 2: Compare with Lawrence and Hughes — both writers portray dreams not merely as passive night visions but as motivating forces that require commitment to realize their potential.  
Step 3: Conclusion — this alignment shows option b is correct: Kalam’s quote implies that dreams should be pursued with determination and dedication.

Why other options are incorrect:
- a is too narrow: Kalam values pursuing dreams, not only their end realization.  
- c is irrelevant: Kalam does not insist on writing dreams down.  
- d is partially true but pessimistic; Kalam’s focus is on action and persistence rather than forgetting, so it’s not the best match.

Question:
What is a key similarity between the dream theories proposed by Freud and those suggested by modern psychologists?

Options:
a. Both suggest that dreams are merely random thoughts without meaning.
b. Both believe that dreams can provide insights into our subconscious.
c. Both theories emphasize the importance of dream interpretation for personal growth.
d. Both assert that dreams happen during the deepest phases of sleep.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall Freud’s theory — he argued that dreams reveal unconscious desires and conflicts, so they give access to the subconscious.  
Step 2: Note modern psychological views — many contemporary theories also treat dreams as reflecting underlying emotions, memories, or unconscious processes that can provide insight into mental states.  
Step 3: Conclusion — both perspectives therefore share the key similarity that dreams can provide insights into our subconscious, so option b is correct.

Why the others are incorrect:
- a is wrong because neither view treats dreams as merely meaningless random thoughts.  
- c is incorrect because Freud emphasized interpretation, but modern psychologists do not universally stress dream interpretation specifically for personal growth.  
- d is wrong because most dreaming occurs in REM sleep, which is not necessarily the deepest sleep stage.

Question:
According to both D.H. Lawrence and Langston Hughes, what is a common characteristic of those who actively pursue their dreams?

Options:
a. They are often considered dangerous or disruptive.
b. They tend to fantasize rather than take action.
c. They dream with open eyes and strive to make their visions a reality.
d. They forget their dreams upon waking.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the common message in D.H. Lawrence and Langston Hughes — both celebrate active, purposeful dreaming rather than passive fantasy.  
Step 2: Match that message to the choices: option (c) says they "dream with open eyes and strive to make their visions a reality," which directly captures active pursuit.  
Why others are wrong: (a) “considered dangerous” is a possible interpretation but not the central shared characteristic; (b) “fantasize rather than take action” contradicts both poets’ emphasis on action; (d) “forget their dreams upon waking” contradicts Hughes’s plea to hold fast to dreams.  
Therefore the correct answer is (c).

Question:
How do the perspectives of Sigmund Freud and modern researchers differ regarding the purpose of dreams?

Options:
a. Freud believes dreams have no purpose, while modern researchers argue they are essential for mental well-being.
b. Freud views dreams as repressed desires, whereas modern researchers see them as meaningless signals.
c. Both Freud and modern researchers believe dreams serve to refresh the mind.
d. Freud suggests dreams are conscious memories, while modern researchers interpret them as cognitive exercises.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Identify Freud’s view — Sigmund Freud considered dreams as symbolic expressions of repressed wishes and unconscious desires, not mere random events.  
Step 2: Identify modern researchers’ view — many contemporary theories (e.g., activation–synthesis, memory consolidation) treat dreams as by-products of neural activity or cognitive processing and often regard them as meaningless signals rather than wish-fulfillment.  
Step 3: Compare with options — option (b) correctly contrasts Freud’s “repressed desires” view with the modern view of dreams as largely meaningless signals.  
Why others are wrong: (a) is wrong because Freud did ascribe a purpose (wish-fulfillment), (c) is wrong because Freud and modern researchers do not both claim dreams simply “refresh the mind,” and (d) is wrong because Freud did not describe dreams as conscious memories.  
Answer: (b)

Question:
What commonality exists between the perspectives on dreams presented by D.H. Lawrence and Langston Hughes, and the broader implications of education as discussed in 'The Parrot's Tale'?

Options:
a. Both suggest that dreams should be ignored if they do not lead to tangible outcomes.
b. Both advocate for the importance of pursuing one's aspirations in life.
c. Both argue that dreams are purely imaginative and have no impact on reality.
d. Both claim that dreams are only beneficial when they are shared with others.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify the central message in each text: D. H. Lawrence presents dreams as expressions of personal longings that should guide a fuller life, and Langston Hughes (in poems like "Dreams") insists that holding on to dreams is vital to avoid despair.  
Step 2 — Relate to 'The Parrot's Tale': that story’s discussion of education emphasizes how aspirations and learning empower individuals to change their circumstances and pursue goals.  
Step 3 — Synthesize: all three perspectives treat dreams/aspirations as important motivations that should be pursued, not ignored.

Therefore the correct choice is b — Both advocate for the importance of pursuing one's aspirations in life.

Why the other options are incorrect:
- a contradicts the texts, which argue against ignoring dreams.  
- c is false because the authors link dreams to real effects on life and action.  
- d is not supported: benefit of dreams is not presented as conditional on sharing them with others.

Question:
How do the perspectives of Lawrence and Hughes on dreams differ in terms of action and realization?

Options:
a. Lawrence believes that only night dreams are valuable, while Hughes emphasizes the importance of holding onto dreams regardless of the time.
b. Lawrence describes daydreamers as dangerous because they actualize their dreams, while Hughes encourages people to cherish dreams but does not focus on action.
c. Both Lawrence and Hughes argue that dreams are irrelevant and do not require action to be meaningful.
d. Hughes believes that dreams are only significant when they are realized, while Lawrence sees value in both night and day dreaming.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify each writer’s stance: Lawrence praises daydreamers because their daytime dreams move into action and are potentially dangerous (they actualize dreams). Hughes, by contrast, urges people to cherish and hold onto their dreams (especially night dreams) but his emphasis is on valuing and protecting dreams rather than on urging concrete action to realize them.

Step 2 — Match to options: Option b exactly captures this contrast — Lawrence links daydreaming to action/realization, while Hughes encourages treasuring dreams without stressing action.

Why the others are wrong:
- a is wrong because Lawrence does not say only night dreams are valuable; he highlights daydreamers.  
- c is wrong because both authors treat dreams as meaningful, not irrelevant.  
- d is wrong because it reverses their emphases: Hughes values keeping dreams, not insisting they must be realized, while Lawrence stresses that daydreams can lead to realization.

Question:
What does Langston Hughes suggest about dreams?

Options:
a. They are unimportant
b. They should be pursued and cherished
c. They are only for the wealthy
d. They are often unattainable


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall Hughes’s poems about dreams (e.g., "Dreams") which advise holding on to dreams: "Hold fast to dreams / For if dreams die / Life is a broken-winged bird / That cannot fly."  
Step 2: From that advice, Hughes suggests dreams are valuable and should be pursued and cherished.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct choice is b. Options a, c, and d are incorrect because Hughes emphasizes the importance and universality of dreams (not that they are unimportant, exclusive to the wealthy, or necessarily unattainable).

Options:
a. Dreams have no effect on mental health
b. Dreams can negatively impact mental health
c. Dreams are essential for mental well-being
d. Dreams are only a distraction


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Read the text and identify the claim about dreams: the text presents dreams as having a positive role for emotional processing and psychological restoration.
2. Match that claim to the options: option c states that "Dreams are essential for mental well-being," which aligns directly with the text's positive framing.
3. Eliminate other options: a ("no effect") contradicts the text, b ("negatively impact") is opposite to the stated benefit, and d ("only a distraction") downplays the constructive role the text attributes to dreams.

Therefore the correct answer is c.

What does the term 'clutter' refer to in the context of dreams?

Options:
a. Unwanted thoughts
b. Important memories
c. External distractions
d. Creative ideas


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: "Clutter" in the context of dreams commonly means excess or irrelevant mental content—unwanted, distracting thoughts or fragments that don’t form meaningful material.  
Step 2: That matches option a, so the correct answer is a.  
Step 3: Options b (important memories) and d (creative ideas) imply meaningful, valuable content, which is opposite to "clutter," and c (external distractions) refers to outside stimuli rather than internal dream content, so they are incorrect.

Options:
a. By causing stress
b. By enhancing creativity
c. By promoting forgetfulness
d. By disrupting sleep


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim asked — the question asks for a way dreams benefit individuals.  
Step 2: Evaluate each option against common psychological findings — research and popular understanding attribute to dreams roles like processing emotions and combining memories, which can lead to novel associations and problem-solving. That matches option b ("By enhancing creativity").  
Step 3: Conclude and rule out others — options a ("By causing stress") and d ("By disrupting sleep") describe harms rather than benefits, and c ("By promoting forgetfulness") is not a typical benefit; therefore the correct answer is b.

What is the main focus of psychoanalytic theory regarding dreams?

Options:
a. Dreams are meaningless
b. Dreams reveal hidden desires
c. Dreams are only memories
d. Dreams are external stimuli


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall that psychoanalytic theory (especially Freud) treats dreams as expressions of the unconscious mind and often as wish-fulfillment that reveal hidden wishes or desires.  
Step 2: Compare options: option b ("Dreams reveal hidden desires") matches this central idea.  
Why others are incorrect: a is wrong because psychoanalysis sees dreams as meaningful, c is wrong because dreams are more than mere memories, and d is wrong because external stimuli may influence dreams but are not the main focus of psychoanalytic theory.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

A nightmare is defined in the text as a dream that causes fear or is frightening. Therefore the correct choice is b because it directly matches that definition. Options a, c, and d are incorrect since a describes a pleasant dream, c describes confusion rather than fear, and d refers to forgetting the dream — none of which match the meaning of "nightmare."

What does the phrase 'dreams with open eyes' mean?

Options:
a. Dreaming while awake
b. Having unrealistic expectations
c. Being aware of one's dreams
d. Sleeping with one's eyes open


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the idiom "dreams with open eyes" — it commonly means imagining or daydreaming while awake.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that meaning: option (a) "Dreaming while awake" matches exactly; option (b) "Having unrealistic expectations" is related but adds a value judgment (unrealistic) not inherent in the phrase; option (c) "Being aware of one's dreams" is literal and refers to sleep dreams (lucid dreaming), so incorrect; option (d) "Sleeping with one's eyes open" is a literal, physical interpretation and not idiomatic.  
Therefore the correct answer is (a).

Options:
a. To confuse the dreamer
b. To process emotions and experiences
c. To entertain the dreamer
d. To predict future events


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize mainstream scientific and psychological theories — many researchers argue that dreaming helps the brain process emotions, consolidate memories, and integrate daily experiences.  
Step 2: Match that idea to the choices: this corresponds directly to option b ("To process emotions and experiences"), so b is the correct answer.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out the others: option a (to confuse the dreamer) and option c (to entertain the dreamer) are not supported as primary functions by evidence, and option d (to predict future events) lacks scientific support.

What is the significance of keeping a dream journal?

Options:
a. To forget dreams more easily
b. To remember and analyze dreams
c. To share dreams with others
d. To create fictional stories


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the primary purpose of a dream journal — to record dreams soon after waking so details aren’t lost and to enable reflection and pattern recognition.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that purpose: option a (forget dreams more easily) is the opposite of recording; option c (to share dreams with others) may happen but isn’t the main significance; option d (to create fictional stories) is a possible byproduct but not the central reason.  
Step 3: Conclude that option b best matches the purpose because keeping a dream journal helps one remember and analyze dreams, making it the correct answer.

b. Someone who has unrealistic aspirations
c. Someone who dreams while awake
d. Someone who is always distracted

Step 1: Interpret the term literally — "day" (awake) + "dreamer" (one who dreams) implies dreaming while awake. Step 2: Compare options: option c correctly matches this meaning; option a refers to dreaming at night (sleep), option b implies unrealistic goals which may be related but is not the precise definition, and option d ("always distracted") overstates the concept. Therefore the correct answer is c.

Question:
What do scientists believe about the duration of dreams?

Options:
a. Dreams always last the entire night
b. Dreams can vary in length
c. Dreams are always short
d. Dreams do not occur during deep sleep


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Scientific studies show that dreams occur mainly during REM sleep and that REM periods repeat and lengthen through the night, so individual dreams can range from a few seconds to around 20–30 minutes.  
Step 2: Therefore the correct idea is that dream duration is variable, so option b is correct.  
Step 3: Briefly, option a is wrong because dreams do not occupy the entire night (they occur in repeated REM episodes); option c is wrong because many dreams can be long (especially later in the night); option d is wrong because dreams primarily occur during REM sleep rather than deep (slow-wave) sleep.

Question:
What is a common theme in many poems about dreams?

Options:
a. Dreams are always negative
b. Dreams reflect societal issues
c. Dreams represent hopes and aspirations
d. Dreams have no significance


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the typical symbolic use — in many poems "dreams" are used as metaphors for personal hopes, desires, and future aspirations.  
Step 2: Reasoning — poets often describe longing, ambition, or imagined better worlds when they write about dreams, which aligns directly with "dreams represent hopes and aspirations."  
Step 3: Eliminate other choices — "dreams are always negative" is false because poems portray both positive and negative dreams; "dreams reflect societal issues" can be true sometimes but is less universal; "dreams have no significance" contradicts the frequent symbolic use.  

Therefore the correct answer is c.

Question:
What is the relationship between dreams and reality as discussed in the text?

Options:
a. Dreams are always a reflection of reality
b. Dreams have no connection to reality
c. Dreams can influence our actions in reality
d. Dreams are purely fictional


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution: Read the part of the text that describes the role of dreams and note whether it links dreams to behavior or outcomes. The text presents examples where dreams affect feelings, motivate choices, or lead people to act, so the correct answer is option c (Dreams can influence our actions in reality). Options a, b and d are incorrect because the text does not claim dreams always mirror reality (a), nor that they are entirely disconnected from it (b), nor that they are purely fictional with no effect on real behavior (d).

Question:
What does the term 'empirical research' refer to?

Options:
a. Research based on observation and experimentation
b. Research based on theoretical concepts
c. Research that is purely speculative
d. Research that is not scientifically valid


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Define the term — empirical research refers to studies that obtain knowledge through direct observation, measurement, or controlled experimentation.  
Step 2: Reasoning — empirical methods collect data from real-world phenomena (e.g., experiments, surveys, observations) and use that data to test hypotheses or answer research questions.  
Step 3: Eliminate incorrect options — theoretical research (option b) relies on models and reasoning rather than collected observations; speculative research (option c) lacks systematic data collection; and saying it is not scientifically valid (option d) is false because empirical research is a cornerstone of scientific validity.  
Conclusion: Therefore the correct answer is option a: Research based on observation and experimentation.

Options:
a. চিন্তাকে সীমাবদ্ধ করে
b. জীবনের উদ্দেশ্য স্পষ্ট করে
c. বিপজ্জনক ভাবে বাস্তবে পরিণত করে
d. কেবল একটি চিন্তা মাত্র


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: টেক্সটের মুখ্য ভাব নিশ্চিত করুন—ডি.এইচ. লরেন্সের "দিনের স্বপ্ন" কল্পনা ও বাস্তবতার সীমা ঝাপসা করে দিনচর্যার ভাবনাগুলোকে শক্তিশালীভাবে বাস্তবে পরিণত হওয়ার ঝুঁকিতে ফেলে।  
ধাপ ২: তাই এটি কেবল চিন্তাকে সীমাবদ্ধ করে না বা জীবনের উদ্দেশ্য স্পষ্ট করে না; বরং কল্পনাকে বিপজ্জনকভাবে বাস্তবে রূপ নিতে উৎসাহ দেয়—সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর হল গ।  
অন্যগুলি কেন নয়: ক ভুল কারণ লরেন্স চিন্তাকে সংকীর্ণ করে না; খ ভুল কারণ তিনি সরাসরি জীবনবোধের উদ্দেশ্য নির্ধারণ করেন না; ঘ ভুল কারণ দিনরাত্রের স্বপ্ন কেবল একটি চিন্তা মাত্র নয়, বরং কার্যকর প্রভাব ফেলতে পারে।

Options:
a. স্বপ্নগুলি সবসময় বাস্তবের প্রতিফলন করে
b. স্বপ্নগুলি বাস্তবতাকে পরিবর্তন করতে পারে
c. স্বপ্নগুলি বাস্তবতার সাথে সম্পর্কহীন
d. স্বপ্নগুলি কেবল রাতের সময় ঘটে


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) ধাপ ১: স্বপ্নকে মনস্তাত্ত্বিক ধারণা, লক্ষ্য বা সৃজনশীল инсপিরেশন হিসেবে দেখা যায় যা ব্যক্তির চিন্তা ও আচরণকে প্রভাবিত করে।  
2) ধাপ ২: যদি কোনো স্বপ্ন বা কল্পনা কোনো পরিকল্পনা, অনুপ্রেরণা বা নতুন ধারণা জাগায়, তা বাস্তবে কর্মে পরিণত হলে বাস্তবতা পরিবর্তিত হতে পারে — এ কারণেই বিকল্প (b) সঠিক।  
3) অপ্রাসঙ্গিকতা ব্যাখ্যা: (a) সব স্বপ্নই বাস্তবের সরাসরি প্রতিফলন নয়; (c) স্বপ্ন সম্পূর্ণভাবে সম্পর্কহীন নয় কারণ তা আচরণ ও সিদ্ধান্তকে প্রভাবিত করে; (d) স্বপ্ন কেবল রাতের নয় (দিনের কল্পনা/বিচিত্র চিন্তাও সাহচর্য হতে পারে) — তাই এগুলো ভুল।

Options:
a. অলংকারিক
b. প্রচলিত
c. প্রদর্শনী
d. প্রবাহিত


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: ফ্রয়েডের স্বপ্ন তত্ত্বের মূল ধারণা হলো স্বপ্ন হল অসচেতন ইচ্ছা ও প্রবণতার প্রকাশ।  
ধাপ ২: তিনি স্বপ্নকে ম্যানিফেস্ট কনটেন্ট (দেখা জিনিস) ও ল্যাটেন্ট কনটেন্ট (গুপ্ত/প্রবাহিত ইচ্ছা) হিসেবে আলাদা করেছেন — মানে স্বপ্নের চিত্রগুলো গভীর বা প্রবাহিত ইচ্ছার প্রতীক।  
ধাপ ৩: তাই প্রশ্নের সঠিক উত্তর হলো d: প্রবাহিত।  
ব্যাখ্যা: অন্য অপশনগুলো (অলংকারিক, প্রচলিত, প্রদর্শনী) ফ্রয়েডের গহ্বরী, অসচেতন ইচ্ছার ব্যাখ্যার সঙ্গে সামঞ্জস্যপূর্ণ নয়।

ডি.এইচ. লরেন্সের কবিতায় 'দিনের স্বপ্ন' কেন বিপজ্জনক বলে উল্লেখিত হয়েছে?

Options:
a. কারণ সেগুলি অষ্পষ্ট
b. কারণ সেগুলি বাস্তবে পরিণত হয়
c. কারণ সেগুলি কেবল চিন্তা
d. কারণ সেগুলি নিরর্থক


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: কবি ডি.এইচ. লরেন্সদিনের স্বপ্নকে বিপজ্জনক মনে করেছেন কারণ এগুলি শুধু মানসিক ইলিউশন নয়, বরং ক্রিয়ায় রূপ নেওয়ার সম্ভাবনা রাখে।  
Step 2: যখন স্বপ্ন বা কল্পনা বাস্তবে পরিণত হতে পারে, তখন তা ব্যক্তির জীবন ও আচরণের উপর অপ্রত্যাশিত ও ক্ষতিকর প্রভাব ফেলতে পারে—এটিই কবির আতঙ্ক ও অভিযোগের মূল।  
কারণের যাচাই: খ ("কারণ সেগুলি বাস্তবে পরিণত হয়") সঠিক; অন্যগুলির ভুল হওয়ার বিন্দু—ক ("অষ্পষ্ট") কেবল বৈশিষ্ট্য নির্দেশ করে না যে বিপদ আছে, গ ("কেবল চিন্তা") কবি মনে করেন না, এবং ঘ ("নিরর্থক") কবিতায় প্রধান যুক্তি নয়।

b. স্বপ্নগুলি মরে গেলে জীবনের মানে নেই
c. স্বপ্নগুলি বাস্তবতার থেকে দূরে
d. স্বপ্নগুলি কেবল চিন্তার অবস্থা


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান: প্রথমে কবিতাটির মূল প্রশ্ন ও উদাহরণ দেখে নির্ধারণ করি — ল্যাংস্টন হিউজের বিখ্যাত কবিতা "What happens to a dream deferred?" (বা "Harlem") একাধিক রূপক ঘটনার মাধ্যমে দেখায় যে স্বপ্ন চাপা রাখা হলে তা ধীরে ধীরে শুকিয়ে যায়, নষ্ট হয় বা বিস্ফোরক ক্ষোভ তৈরি করে। এই ব্যাখ্যার উপর ভিত্তি করে মূল বার্তা হলো যে স্বপ্নগুলি মরে গেলে মানুষের জীবনের মানে ও আশা ক্ষয় হয়, তাই সঠিক উত্তর b। অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ: a শুধুমাত্র রাতের স্বপ্ন বোঝায় যা কবিতার মোহভঙ্গের ভাব ধরে না, c ও d কবিতার মূল সতর্কতা বা ক্ষোভের তীব্রতা প্রকাশ করে না।

b. স্বপ্নগুলি মানসিক স্বাস্থ্যের জন্য গুরুত্বপূর্ণ
c. স্বপ্নগুলি কেবল মস্তিষ্কের অবসন্নতা
d. স্বপ্নগুলি কেবল ক্ষণিকের চিন্তা


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: বৈজ্ঞানিক গবেষণা ও স্নায়ুবিজ্ঞানের উপাত্ত পর্যালোচনা করলে দেখা যায় যে স্বপ্ন প্রধানত REM ঘুমে ঘটে এবং স্মৃতি সংহতকরণ, আবেগ প্রক্রিয়াকরণ ও মানসিক পুনর্গঠনে অংশ নেয়।  
ধাপ ২: এই কার্যকারিতা বিবেচনা করে বিভিন্ন উত্তরগুলোর সাথে মিলিয়ে দেখা হলে স্পষ্ট হয় যে স্বপ্নগুলি কেবল নিরর্থক বা কেবল মস্তিষ্কের অবসন্নতা/ক্ষণিক চিন্তা নয়, বরং মানসিক স্বাস্থ্যের জন্য গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ভূমিকা রাখে।  
অতএব সঠিক উত্তর: b: স্বপ্নগুলি মানসিক স্বাস্থ্যের জন্য গুরুত্বপূর্ণ।

Options:
a. পুনরুদ্ধার তত্ত্ব
b. চিকিৎসা তত্ত্ব
c. সাবেক চিন্তার তত্ত্ব
d. কগনিটিভ তত্ত্ব


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: কগনিটিভ তত্ত্বটি স্বপ্নকে মস্তিষ্কের তথ্যপ্রক্রিয়াকরণ, স্মৃতি প্রক্রিয়াকরণ ও চিন্তার ধারাবাহিকতার অংশ হিসেবে দেখে — অর্থাৎ স্বপ্ন হল মস্তিষ্কের সক্রিয় সিগন্যাল ও মানসিক কাজের পরিচয়।  
ধাপ ২: তাই মস্তিষ্ক থেকে আসা স্নায়ুতাত্ত্বিক সিগন্যাল এবং তাদের মানসিক ব্যাখ্যা কগনিটিভ তত্ত্বেই পরিষ্কারভাবে ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়; এটি দেখায় কীভাবে তাত্ত্বিক নেটওয়ার্ক ও তথ্য প্রক্রিয়া স্বপ্নের অভিজ্ঞতায় রূপ নেয়।  
ধাপ ৩: অন্য অপশনগুলো অনুপযুক্ত কারণ — পুনরুদ্ধার তত্ত্ব মূলত বিশ্রাম/পুনরায়তনের ওপর গুরুত্ব দেয়, উপরের চিন্তার (continuity) তত্ত্ব শুধু জাগরণকালীন চিন্তার ধারাবাহিকতার ওপর জোর দেয়, আর ‘চিকিৎসা তত্ত্ব’ এখানে মস্তিষ্কের সিগন্যালের ব্যাখ্যা হিসাবে সরাসরি প্রযোজ্য নয়।  
সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: কগনিটিভ তত্ত্ব (d).

b. স্মৃতি সংরক্ষণ করে
c. শরীরের পেশীগুলি বিশ্রাম নেয়
d. অবসন্নতা দূর করে


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: স্বপ্ন সাধারণত REM (Rapid Eye Movement) পর্যায়ে ঘটে, যেখানে মস্তিষ্কের ক্রিয়াশীলতা বেড়ে যায় এবং কল্পনা ও ধারণার পুনর্গঠন ঘটে।  
ধাপ ২: তাই স্বপ্নের সময় মস্তিষ্ক নতুন ধারণা তৈরি করে, মানে সৃজনশীল চিন্তা ও আইডিয়ার সংমিশ্রণ ঘটে—এ জন্য সঠিক উত্তর ক।  
ধাপ ৩: অন্য অপশনগুলির ব্যাখ্যা সংক্ষেপে: খ (স্মৃতি সংরক্ষণ) আংশিকভাবে ঘুমের কাজ হলেও তা প্রধানত স্টেজ NREM-এ বেশি সক্রিয়; গ (শরীরের পেশীগুলি বিশ্রাম নেয়) শরীরগত পেশী যে-বিশ্রাম নেয় তা মস্তিষ্কের কাজ নয়; ঘ (অবসন্নতা দূর করে) সম্পূর্ণ ঘুমের কাজ হলেও স্বপ্ন নিজেই সরাসরি অবসন্নতা দূর করার প্রধান প্রক্রিয়া নয়।

c. ভিন্ন ভিন্ন ধরনের অনুভূতি

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: স্বপ্ন সাধারণত মস্তিষ্কের সক্রিয় মানসিক অবস্থায় তৈরি হয় এবং সেখানে ব্যক্তির পুরোনো স্মৃতি, উদ্বেগ, আশা ইত্যাদি মিশে থাকে।  
Step 2: এই কারণে স্বপ্নে শুধুমাত্র সুখকর বা শুধুমাত্র ভয়ঙ্কর অনুভূতিই দেখা যাবে—এমন একটি সীমিত ব্যাখ্যা সঠিক নয়; বরং একই ব্যাক্তির স্বপ্নে বিভিন্ন সময় বিভিন্ন ধরনের অনুভূতি যেমন আনন্দ, ভয়, আবেগ, বিস্ময় ইত্যাদি দেখা যায়।  
Step 3: তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো c: ভিন্ন ভিন্ন ধরনের অনুভূতি। অন্যান্য অপশনগুলো ত্রুটিপূর্ণ কারণ a ও b একমাত্র ধরনের অনুভূতির কথা বলে যা বাস্তবে সীমাবদ্ধ নয়, আর d বলছে কেবল এলোমেলো—স্বপ্নে এলোমেলোতা থাকলেও সেখানে নির্দিষ্ট অনুভূতিও প্রবলভাবে উপস্থিত থাকতে পারে।

Solution:
সমাধান: স্বপ্ন সাধারণত অবচেতন চিন্তার মাধ্যমে প্রকাশ পায়, তাই খ সঠিক উত্তর। কারণ স্বপ্নে দেখা প্রতীক, ইচ্ছা ও অসম্পূর্ণ স্মৃতিগুলো সচেতন মন থেকে নয় বরং অবচেতন প্রক্রিয়ার ফল; এটি মনস্তাত্ত্বিক বিশ্লেষণও সমর্থন করে। অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো—ক (চেতন চিন্তা), গ (অনুভূতি) ও ঘ (দৃষ্টি)—আংশিকভাবে উপস্থিত থাকতে পারে কিন্তু স্বপ্নের মৌলিক উৎস হিসেবে অবচেতন চিন্তার তুলনায় সেগুলো প্রধান নয়।

স্বপ্নের ব্যাখ্যা করতে ফ্রয়েডের তত্ত্ব কিভাবে কার্যকর হয়?

Options:
a. স্বপ্নগুলি আমাদের সচেতন ইচ্ছা প্রকাশ করে
b. স্বপ্নগুলি আমাদের অজ্ঞাত চিন্তা প্রকাশ করে
c. স্বপ্নগুলি কেবল একটি আবেগ
d. স্বপ্নগুলি বাস্তবতার প্রতিফলন


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: ফ্রয়েডের তত্ত্ব অনুযায়ী স্বপ্নকে দেখা হয় অজ্ঞাত (unconscious) ইচ্ছা এবং লাঠিসঞ্চারের (repressed) মানসিক উপাদানগুলোর প্রকাশ হিসেবে।  
ধাপ ২: তিনি স্বপ্নের মধ্যে প্রকট বিষয়বস্তু (manifest content) এবং গোপন/ latent বিষয়বস্তুর মধ্যে পার্থক্য করেছেন; প্রকট অবস্থায় যা মনে পড়ে তা ল্যাটেন্ট ইচ্ছার বিমূর্ত রূপ। তাই স্বপ্ন মূলত অজ্ঞাত চিন্তার প্রকাশ।  
ধাপন ৩: ফলে সঠিক উত্তর হলো বিকল্প b — "স্বপ্নগুলি আমাদের অজ্ঞাত চিন্তা প্রকাশ করে"।  
বিবেচ্য: বিকল্প a ভুল কারণ ফ্রয়েড সচেতন ইচ্ছাকে প্রধান মনে করেননি; c ভুল কারণ তিনি স্বপ্নকে কেবল আবেগ নয় বরং মানসিক কাঠামোর ফল হিসেবে দেখেছেন; d ভুল কারণ স্বপ্ন সরাসরি বাস্তবতার প্রতিফলন নয় বরং আভ্যন্তরীণ ইচ্ছা ও প্রতিক্রিয়ার রূপ।

b. এগুলি পূর্ব নির্ধারিত
c. এগুলি মস্তিষ্কের কার্যকলাপের ফলাফল
d. এগুলি বাস্তবতার প্রতিফলন


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: নিউরোসায়েন্স পরীক্ষায় (যেমন EEG ও fMRI) দেখা গেছে REM ঘুমের সময় মস্তিষ্কের নির্দিষ্ট অংশগুলিতে সক্রিয়তা বাড়ে এবং সেই সক্রিয়তার ধরন স্বপ্নের কন্টেন্টের সঙ্গে সম্পর্কযুক্ত।  
ধাপ ২: এ থেকে বিজ্ঞানীরা ব্যাখ্যা করে যে স্বপ্ন সাধারণত মস্তিষ্কের স্নায়ুনৈর্ব্যক্তিক কার্যকলাপ—মেমরি প্রসেসিং, আবেগের নিয়ন্ত্রণ ও বোধগম্যতা সংক্রান্ত প্রক্রিয়ার—ফলাফল; তাই সঠিক উত্তর গ।  

অন্য অপশনগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: ক (কেবল এলোমেলো) আংশিকভাবে সত্য হতে পারে কিন্তু সম্পূর্ণ ব্যাখ্যা নয়; খ (পূর্ব নির্ধারিত) এর জন্য বৈজ্ঞানিক প্রমাণ নেই; ঘ (বাস্তবতার প্রতিফলন) কিছু স্বপ্নে বাস্তব জীবনের উপাদান থাকে, কিন্তু স্বপ্ন সবসময় সরাসরি বাস্তবতার প্রতিলিপি নয়।

Options:
a. কারণ তারা বাস্তবতা এড়াতে চান
b. কারণ তারা স্বপ্নকে বাস্তবায়িত করতে চান
c. কারণ তারা কেবল চিন্তা করেন
d. কারণ তারা বাস্তবতার বাহিরে


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
ধাপ ১: প্রশ্নের অর্থ বোঝা—কবি কেন স্বপ্ন দেখেন তা বিচার করতে হবে যে স্বপ্নটি কেবল কল্পনা নাকি কাজের পরিকল্পনা ও অনুপ্রেরণা।  
ধাপ ২: কবিদের কার্যকারণ বিশ্লেষণ—অন্তর্দৃষ্টি ও কল্পনা থেকে তারা নতুন ভাবনা, সমাজ পরিবর্তনের চিত্র বা শিল্পকর্ম তৈরি করতে চান;つまり তারা স্বপ্নকে বাস্তবে রূপ দিতে উদ্দীপ্ত থাকেন।  
ধাপ ৩: সঠিক উত্তর নির্ণয়—এটি (b)– কারণ “স্বপ্নকে বাস্তবায়িত করতে চান” কথাটি কবিদের সৃষ্টিশীল উদ্দেশ্যকে সঠিকভাবে প্রতিফলিত করে।  
অতিরিক্ত ব্যাখ্যা: (a) শুধু বাস্তবতা এড়ানোর মানে দেয় যা সার্বিক উদ্দেশ্য নয়; (c) কেবল চিন্তা করা অতিরিক্ত সরলীকরণ; (d) “বাস্তবতার বাইরে” অস্পষ্ট ও তাত্ত্বিক—তাই এগুলো উপযুক্ত উত্তর নয়।

স্বপ্ন সম্পর্কে বিজ্ঞানীরা কি বলেছেন?

Options:
a. স্বপ্নগুলি কোন উদ্দেশ্য নেই
b. স্বপ্নগুলি আমাদের মানসিক স্বাস্থ্য ঠিক রাখে
c. স্বপ্নগুলি কেবল একটি অবস্থা
d. স্বপ্নগুলি শুধুমাত্র রাতের জন্য


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1) বৈজ্ঞানিক গবেষণায় দেখা গেছে যে স্বপ্ন (বিশেষত REM ঘুমের সময়) স্মৃতি সংহতকরণ, আবেগ প্রক্রিয়াকরণ এবং মানসিক পুনরুদ্ধারে ভূমিকা রাখে — ফলে স্বপ্নগুলোর কার্যকারিতা সম্পর্কে গবেষকরা অনেক প্রমাণ পেয়েছেন।  
2) তাই সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে (b) — "স্বপ্নগুলি আমাদের মানসিক স্বাস্থ্য ঠিক রাখে"।  
3) অন্য বিকল্পগুলো ভুল কারণ: (a) সম্পূর্ণ ভুল — গবেষণা বলছে স্বপ্নের কিছু উদ্দেশ্য আছে; (c) "কেবল একটি অবস্থা" বলাটা অসম্পূর্ণ কারণ স্বপ্নগুলো কার্যকরী প্রক্রিয়াসমূহের সাথে যুক্ত; (d) "শুধুমাত্র রাতের জন্য"ও ভুল কারণ স্বপ্নজাতীয় অভিজ্ঞতা দিনকেন্দ্রিক অবস্থাতেও ঘটতে পারে (যেমন দিনস্বপ্ন বা স্লিপ-ওনসেটে)।

Question:
হিউজের কবিতায় স্বপ্নগুলি কেন গুরুত্বপূর্ণ বলা হয়েছে?

Options:
a. কারণ সেগুলি আমাদের জীবনের উদ্দেশ্য দেয়
b. কারণ সেগুলি কেবল চিন্তা
c. কারণ সেগুলি মস্তিষ্কের অবসন্নতা
d. কারণ সেগুলি বাস্তবতার প্রতিফলন


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. প্রশ্নের মূল ভাবনা: হিউজের কবিতায় "স্বপ্ন"গুলো সাধারণত অনুপ্রেরণা ও জীবনের লক্ষ্য-উদ্দেশ্য হিসেবে উপস্থাপিত হয়—এগুলো ব্যক্তির ভাবনা ও কর্মের পথনির্দেশ করে।
2. বিশ্লেষণ: ক ("কারণ সেগুলি আমাদের জীবনের উদ্দেশ্য দেয়") এই ব্যাখ্যার সাথে সরাসরি সঙ্গতিপূর্ণ; কবিতায় স্বপ্নকে লক্ষ্য ও আশা হিসেবে বলা হয়।  
3. অপশনগুলোর প্রত্যাখ্যান: খ ("কেবল চিন্তা") অতিরঞ্জিতভাবে ক্ষুদ্র করে দেখা—কবিতায় স্বপ্ন সাধারণত কার্যকরী ও দিকনির্দেশক; গ ("মস্তিষ্কের অবসন্নতা") অসঙ্গতিপূর্ণ ও নেতিবাচক ব্যাখ্যা; ঘ ("বাস্তবতার প্রতিফলন") আংশিক হলেও পুরোতর নয়, কারণ স্বপ্ন প্রায়ই ভবিষ্যৎ আশা/উদ্দেশ্য নির্দেশ করে।  
সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর: ক.

Question:
স্বপ্নের সময় আমাদের মস্তিষ্ক কিভাবে কাজ করে?

Options:
a. মনে রাখতে সাহায্য করে
b. জীবনকে সহজ করে
c. নতুন চিন্তা তৈরি করে
d. অবসন্নতা দূর করে


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
সমাধান:
Step 1: প্রথমে প্রতিটি অপশনের অর্থ বোঝি — (a) মনে রাখতে সাহায্য করে, (b) জীবনকে সহজ করে, (c) নতুন চিন্তা তৈরি করে, (d) অবসন্নতা দূর করে।  
Step 2: স্নায়ুবিজ্ঞানের অভিজ্ঞতা অনুযায়ী স্বপ্ন, বিশেষ করে REM পর্যায়ের স্বপ্ন, মস্তিষ্কে ভিন্ন স্মৃতি ও ধারণাকে মিলিয়ে নতুন অস্পষ্ট সংযোগ গঠন করে এবং সৃজনশীলতা বাড়ায়।  
Step 3: তাই প্রশ্নে প্রদত্ত সঠিক উত্তর হলো (c) — কারণ স্বপ্ন নতুন চিন্তা ও ধারণা তৈরি করতে সাহায্য করে।  
সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে বাকি অপশনগুলি ভুল কারণ: (a) সম্পূর্ণভাবে স্বপ্নই স্মরণশক্তি বাড়ায় না (স্লিপ কনসোলিডেশন ভূমিকা রাখে), (b) জীবনকে সরাসরি সহজ করে না, এবং (d) অবসন্নতা কমানো মূলত বিশ্রামের কাজ; এগুলি স্বপ্নের মুখ্য উদ্দেশ্য নয়।

Question:
ফ্রয়েডের মতে, স্বপ্নগুলি কোন ধরনের ইচ্ছার প্রতীক?

Options:
a. অর্থনৈতিক
b. সামাজিক
c. অবচেতন
d. সচেতন


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
সমাধান:
1. ধাপ ১: সিগমুন্ড ফ্রয়েডের মনোবৈজ্ঞানিক তত্ত্ব অনুসারে স্বপ্ন হল মনের সেই অংশের প্রকাশ যেখানে লিঙ্গভিত্তিক ও অন্যান্য চাপিত ইচ্ছা ও বাসনাগুলি লুকানো থাকে — অর্থাৎ এগুলো মূলত অবচেতন ইচ্ছার প্রতীক।  
2. ধাপ ২: ফ্রয়েড বলেন স্বপ্নে উপস্থিত বস্তুর পৃষ্ঠভাগ (manifest content) আসলে ল্যাটেন্ট কনটেন্ট বা অবচেতন মনোবাসনার সংকেত ও প্রতীক হিসেবে আসে, তাই স্বপ্নকে সচেতন বা সামাজিক/অর্থনৈতিক ইচ্ছার সরাসরি প্রতিফলন বলা যায় না।  
নির্ধারণ: সুতরাং সঠিক উত্তর হচ্ছে গ (অবচেতন)।  
অন্য অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ ক (অর্থনৈতিক) ও খ (সামাজিক) ফ্রয়েডিয়ান ব্যাখ্যায় কেন্দ্রীয় নয়, এবং ঘ (সচেতন) মূলত এর বিপরীত ধারণা।
