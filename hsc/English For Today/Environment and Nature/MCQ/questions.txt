Question:
What role do women's voices play in both 'Sultana’s Dream' and Greta Thunberg's activism as seen in the readings?

Options:
a. They are often dismissed in discussions about environmental issues.
b. They challenge societal norms and advocate for change.
c. They support traditional views without questioning them.
d. They primarily focus on personal issues rather than global problems.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the common theme — both texts highlight women speaking out about public, societal problems rather than being silent or confined to private matters.
Step 2: In "Sultana’s Dream" the narrator imagines a woman-led utopia that overturns patriarchal norms and proposes progressive solutions; Greta Thunberg’s activism publicly challenges political and social complacency on climate change and demands systemic action.
Step 3: Therefore the best answer is option b: their voices challenge societal norms and advocate for change.
Briefly why the others are wrong: option a is incorrect because the works foreground, not dismiss, women’s voices; option c is wrong because both question and overturn traditional views; option d is incorrect because both focus on broad social and environmental issues, not merely personal ones.

Question:
In the context of environmental justice, what does the phrase 'no justice, no peace' imply about the relationship between social issues and environmental concerns?

Options:
a. Environmental issues are distinct from social justice issues.
b. Environmental concerns should take precedence over social justice.
c. Social justice and environmental issues are interconnected and must be addressed together.
d. Peace can be achieved without addressing environmental degradation.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: The slogan "no justice, no peace" in environmental justice contexts means that environmental harms and social injustices are linked—communities facing poverty, racism, or political marginalization often suffer greater environmental burdens.  
Step 2: Therefore resolving environmental problems requires addressing the underlying social inequities (policy, economic power, access to decision-making), not treating them as separate issues.  
Step 3: That reasoning directly matches option c: social justice and environmental issues are interconnected and must be addressed together.  
Why the other options are wrong: option a incorrectly treats them as distinct; option b wrongly prioritizes environment over social justice rather than integrating both; option d is false because lasting peace typically requires addressing environmental degradation where it disproportionately affects vulnerable communities.

Question:
What is the significance of Greta Thunberg referring to her Asperger syndrome as her 'superpower' in relation to environmental activism?

Options:
a. It highlights the need for people with disabilities to stay silent.
b. It suggests that differences can drive passion and clarity in advocacy.
c. It implies that individuals with disabilities cannot be effective activists.
d. It shows that personal struggles are irrelevant to environmental issues.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Greta Thunberg calling her Asperger syndrome a "superpower" emphasizes that a neurodivergent trait gives her a focused perspective and strong motivation for climate action. Step 1: Interpret the phrase as re-framing a personal difference as a strength in advocacy. Step 2: Match this meaning to the options — option b correctly states that differences can drive passion and clarity in advocacy. Options a and c are incorrect because they claim silence or ineffectiveness, which contradicts Thunberg’s example; option d is incorrect because it denies the relevance of personal experience, whereas she uses her experience to strengthen her message.

Question:
How does the imagery of nature in Pablo Neruda's poem parallel the themes of environmental degradation discussed in the readings?

Options:
a. Both focus solely on urban life without reference to nature.
b. Both emphasize the beauty of nature while ignoring environmental concerns.
c. Both highlight the interconnectedness of life and the importance of preserving nature.
d. Both suggest that human actions have no impact on the environment.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Identify the poem’s imagery: Neruda’s nature images (sea, trees, earth, cycles) emphasize relationships between living things and the environment, often showing loss or damage as affecting human life too.  
2. Compare with the readings: the readings on environmental degradation similarly stress how ecosystems are interconnected and how human actions harm those systems, calling for preservation.  
3. Conclusion: these parallel emphases — interconnectedness and the need to protect nature — match option c, so c is correct.  
4. Why others are wrong: a is wrong because both texts refer to nature, not solely urban life; b is wrong because they do not ignore environmental concerns; d is wrong because both attribute significant impact to human actions.

Question:
In 'Toba Tek Singh', what does Bishen Singh's confusion about his identity represent in the context of the partition?

Options:
a. The clarity of cultural identities post-partition.
b. The disorientation and loss of identity experienced during the partition.
c. The importance of maintaining traditional values.
d. The rejection of mental health issues in society.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the symbol — Bishan Singh’s repeated confusion about whether he belongs to India or Pakistan represents more than individual madness; it reflects a wider social condition created by the Partition.

Step 2: Reasoning — His inability to name his village or settle on a national identity mirrors the disorientation, uprootedness and loss of cultural/personal identity experienced by millions during the Partition, so the story uses his confusion as a metaphor for that trauma.

Step 3: Conclusion — Therefore the correct answer is (b): the disorientation and loss of identity experienced during the partition.

Why the other options are incorrect: (a) is the opposite of the story’s portrayal, (c) (importance of maintaining traditional values) is not the central symbolic point, and (d) (rejection of mental health issues) is not the primary thematic focus—mental illness is a narrative device to highlight partition’s human cost, not a critique of societal attitudes toward psychiatry.

Question:
What does the interaction between Chubukov and Lomov in 'The Proposal' reveal about societal expectations regarding marriage and land ownership?

Options:
a. Marriage is seen as a trivial matter compared to land disputes.
b. Land ownership is irrelevant in romantic proposals.
c. Marriage is primarily a business transaction linked to property.
d. The characters prioritize love over financial stability.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Step 1: Observe the interaction — Chubukov proposes marriage as a means to settle practical matters (secure family ties and consolidate property), and much of the dialogue revolves around disputes over land and oxen rather than romantic feeling.  
Step 2: Reasoning — because the marriage proposal is presented in connection with property interests and social standing, the play portrays marriage as a transaction tied to material and legal concerns.  
Step 3: Conclusion — this directly supports option c: marriage is primarily a business transaction linked to property.  
Why the others are wrong: option a is false because marriage is not treated as trivial compared to land disputes; rather they are intertwined. Option b is wrong because land ownership is central to the proposal. Option d is incorrect since love is not portrayed as the priority over financial or property considerations.

Question:
How does Masanobu Fukuoka’s philosophy of natural farming contrast with the traditional scientific methods discussed in the readings?

Options:
a. Fukuoka advocates for heavy reliance on chemical fertilizers.
b. Traditional methods emphasize understanding nature's complexity.
c. Fukuoka promotes minimal intervention and harmony with nature.
d. Both methods focus on maximizing crop yield through technology.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Masanobu Fukuoka’s natural farming advocates minimal human intervention—no tilling, no chemical fertilizers, no pesticides—and aims to work in harmony with natural processes rather than control them.  
2. Traditional scientific agricultural methods (as discussed in the readings) typically rely on deliberate manipulation: experiments, inputs (fertilizers, pesticides), and technologies to increase and regulate yields.  
3. Therefore the correct contrast is that Fukuoka promotes minimal intervention and harmony with nature, which matches option c.  
4. Option a is false because it states the opposite of Fukuoka’s approach; option b is misleading because traditional scientific methods focus more on controlled manipulation than holistic deference to nature; option d is incorrect because Fukuoka’s method specifically rejects technological/chemical maximization.

Question:
What common theme is present in both the story of Sultana’s Dream and the environmental justice movement?

Options:
a. The idea that gender roles should remain traditional.
b. The notion that women should take control of their own destinies.
c. The belief that nature can be controlled through technology.
d. The acceptance of environmental degradation as inevitable.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central idea in Sultana’s Dream — it portrays a utopian "Ladyland" where women lead, make decisions, and control social and technological change, emphasizing women’s agency and empowerment.  
Step 2: Identify the core of the environmental justice movement — it seeks fair treatment and meaningful participation of all people (often highlighting women and marginalized groups) in environmental decision-making, stressing that those affected should have control over their destinies.  
Step 3: Compare — both focus on women taking control of their own destinies and leadership in shaping society, so option b is the best match.  
Why the others are incorrect: option a contradicts Sultana’s Dream’s rejection of traditional passive gender roles; option c (nature controlled by technology) is a secondary element in the story and not central to environmental justice; option d is false because both the story and the movement resist accepting environmental or social harms as inevitable.

Question:
In what way does Greta Thunberg's activism reflect the environmental justice concerns discussed in the reading?

Options:
a. Her actions focus solely on climate change without considering social issues.
b. Her activism emphasizes that environmental issues disproportionately affect marginalized communities.
c. She believes that all environmental problems are man-made and therefore solvable.
d. Her speeches advocate for immediate economic growth over environmental protection.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the core of “environmental justice” from the reading — that environmental harms and climate impacts are unevenly distributed and often hit marginalized, low-income, and frontline communities hardest.  
Step 2: Match that core to Greta Thunberg’s activism — her speeches and campaigns repeatedly highlight climate justice, the need to protect vulnerable populations, and that those least responsible suffer most.  
Step 3: Compare options: b directly states the disproportionate effect on marginalized communities and matches both the reading and Thunberg’s message, so it is correct. Options a, c, and d are incorrect because they either ignore the social justice dimension, misstate her primary emphasis, or contradict her calls for prioritizing environmental protection over unchecked economic growth.

Options:
a. Both emphasize the importance of water for survival.
b. Both suggest that water is abundant and not a concern.
c. Both highlight the beauty of water bodies.
d. Both ignore the pollution affecting water sources.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
সমাধান:
প্রথম ধাপ: Coleridge-এর কবিতায় জলসঙ্কট সাধারণত জীবনের অনিবার্য চাহিদা ও তার অনুপস্থিতির ভয় দেখায় — অর্থাৎ জল না থাকলে বেঁচে থাকা কঠিন হয়ে পড়ে।  
দ্বিতীয় ধাপ: Buriganga রিপোর্টে পরিবেশ দূষণ ও নদীর অবনতি করে পানির গুণমান ও প্রাপ্যতা হ্রাসের কারণে মানুষের জীবনযাত্রা ও স্বাস্থ্য বিপন্ন হওয়া তুলে ধরা হয়েছে।  
তৃতীয় ধাপ: উভয় উৎসই জলের গুরুত্ব ও তার সংকটকে গুরুত্ব নিয়ে আলোচনা করে, ফলে সঙ্গত সমাপনী হলো যে তারা উভয়ই জলের জীবিকার জন্য অপরিহার্যতা তুলে ধরে।  
অতএব সঠিক উত্তর: a. অন্য অপশনগুলির ভুলতা: b জলকে প্রাচুর্যের প্রতীক বলে দাবি করে—কিন্তু উভয়েই সংকট তুলে ধরে; c শুধু সৌন্দর্য তুলে ধরে না; d ভুল কারণ Buriganga রিপোর্ট দূষণের কথা স্পষ্টভাবে উপস্থাপন করে।

Question:
How does the pollution in the Buriganga River relate to the broader themes of environmental justice highlighted by both Greta Thunberg's activism and the challenges faced by local water bodies in Bangladesh?

Options:
a. It shows that only urban areas are affected by pollution.
b. It demonstrates the impact of industrial waste on marginalized communities and emphasizes the need for equitable environmental policies.
c. It indicates that rivers have always been polluted and will continue to be.
d. It suggests that only government actions can resolve environmental issues.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Explanation:
Step 1 — Identify the common theme: both Greta Thunberg’s activism and the pollution of the Buriganga highlight environmental justice — who suffers most from environmental harm and who has the power to change it.  
Step 2 — Apply this to the Buriganga: industrial effluents and untreated waste disproportionately harm marginalized groups (fisherfolk, low-income riverside communities), showing a link between pollution sources and social inequity.  
Step 3 — Choose the best option: this reasoning matches option b because it emphasizes industrial waste’s impact on vulnerable communities and the need for equitable policies.  
Why the other options are wrong: option a is false because pollution affects rural and peri-urban areas too, not only cities; option c is a fatalistic claim that ignores causes and solutions; option d is too narrow — government action is necessary but not sufficient without industry accountability and community involvement.

c. Deforestation
d. Waste management


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: তালিকাভুক্ত সমস্যাগুলো বিবেচনা করা—ঢাকায় প্রধান পরিবেশগত সমস্যা হিসেবে জলের দূষণ, বায়ু দূষণ, বনায়নহ্রাস ও বর্জ্য ব্যবস্থাপনা সবই আছে।  
Step 2: কারণ নির্ধারণ—ঢাকার নৌনদীসমূহ (যেমন বুড়িগঙ্গা) ও প্রচুর পয়ঃনিষ্কাশন ও শিল্পগত আপদন প্রবাহের ফলে পানির তীব্র দূষণ দেখা দেয়, যা পানীয় জলের নিরাপত্তা ও জৈববৈচিত্র্যের ওপর সরাসরি প্রভাব ফেলে।  
Step 3: সিদ্ধান্ত—এই কারণগুলো থেকে মূল উদ্বেগ হিসেবে জলের দূষণ (option b) সবচেয়ে প্রাধান্য পায়।  

অপর অপশনগুলোর সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: বায়ু দূষণ (a) ও বর্জ্য ব্যবস্থাপনা (d) গুরুত্বপূর্ণ সমস্যা হলেও ঢাকার ক্ষেত্রে সবচেয়ে তাৎপর্যপূর্ণ ও বহুলপ্রভাবশালী সমস্যা হিসেবে জলদূষণ বিবেচিত হয়; বননাশ (c) শহরের জন্য অপেক্ষাকৃত কম প্রাথমিক।

Options:
a. To entertain
b. To inform and inspire change
c. To promote economic growth
d. To create political discourse


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main idea in the text — literature is described as a vehicle that explains environmental problems, evokes empathy, and motivates readers toward better behavior or policy change.  
Step 2: Match that idea to the options. Option (b) “To inform and inspire change” directly captures both the informative and motivational roles.  
Why others are incorrect: (a) “To entertain” is only a partial or secondary function, not the primary role suggested; (c) “To promote economic growth” and (d) “To create political discourse” may occur indirectly but are not the central purposes described.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Step 3 — উপযুক্ত সিদ্ধান্ত: option b (increased regulations) সরাসরি শিল্পবর্জ্য নিয়ন্ত্রণ, মানদণ্ড আর তদারকি বাড়ায় ফলে নদীর দূষণ কমাতে কার্যকর — তাই সঠিক উত্তর হলো b.

Options:
a. Protection of corporate interests
b. Equal access to environmental benefits
c. Promotion of industrial growth
d. Limitation of public participation


Correct Answer: খ

Step 1: Recall the core idea of environmental justice — it seeks fair distribution of environmental benefits and burdens and equal protection and participation for all communities.  
Step 2: Compare each option to that definition: option b, "Equal access to environmental benefits," directly matches the principle of fairness in distribution and access.  
Step 3: Eliminate the others: option a (protection of corporate interests) and option c (promotion of industrial growth) prioritize specific economic actors rather than fairness, and option d (limitation of public participation) contradicts the environmental-justice emphasis on inclusive decision-making.

Step 2: It was used by local populations historically for drinking and household water before modern supply systems, supporting option b.  
Step 3: The river appears in local culture, literature, and communal life, making it a cultural symbol and supporting option c.

What does the text suggest is a major cause of river pollution?

Options:
a. Agricultural runoff
b. Industrial waste
c. Household waste
d. All of the above


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify what each option contributes — agricultural runoff brings fertilizers and pesticides that cause eutrophication, industrial waste releases toxic chemicals and heavy metals, and household waste (sewage, plastics) adds organic pollution and debris.  
Step 2: These sources commonly act together in real rivers, so no single source alone explains most pollution in many cases.  
Step 3: Therefore the best answer is option d, "All of the above", because all listed sources are major contributors to river pollution; options a, b, and c are each correct individually but not exclusive.

Solution:
Step 1: Identify the conservation status of the listed animals — the elongated tortoise (Indotestudo elongata) is classified as Critically Endangered in Bangladesh (and globally) due to severe habitat loss and heavy poaching.  
Step 2: Compare the others: the Bengal tiger and Asian elephant are listed as Endangered, and the Indian (greater one-horned) rhino is listed as Vulnerable.  
Step 3: Since only the elongated tortoise meets the "Critically Endangered" category, the correct answer is b: Elongated Tortoise.

Question:
What does the term 'Environmental Justice' refer to?

Options:
a. Fair distribution of environmental benefits
b. Legal rights of environmental activists
c. Government policies on pollution
d. Protection of endangered species


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Define the term — Environmental justice means fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, and fair distribution of environmental benefits and burdens.  
Step 2: Compare options — a states "Fair distribution of environmental benefits," which matches the core idea of environmental justice.  
Step 3: Conclude — therefore the correct answer is option a.

Explanation of why others are incorrect:
- b "Legal rights of environmental activists" is narrower (focuses on activists rather than community fairness).  
- c "Government policies on pollution" refers to one policy area, not the broad fairness and participation principle.  
- d "Protection of endangered species" is an environmental goal but not the definition of environmental justice.

Question:
What is the primary reason for the extinction of species mentioned in the text?

Options:
a. Climate change
b. Habitat destruction
c. Pollution
d. Hunting


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the statement in the text that points to the main cause — it says species are disappearing because their natural areas are being removed or broken up.  
Step 2: Interpret this: removal or fragmentation of natural areas is "habitat destruction", which directly reduces population size, breeding sites and food sources, leading to extinction.  
Step 3: Conclude the correct option: b — Habitat destruction.

Brief note on other options: climate change, pollution and hunting can also cause declines, but the text explicitly cites loss of habitat as the primary reason, so a, c and d are not the best answers.

Question:
What movement is associated with Greta Thunberg?

Options:
a. Fridays for Future
b. Earth Day
c. Save the Earth
d. Greenpeace


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution: Recall Greta Thunberg became globally known for starting school climate strikes in 2018, where students skipped school on Fridays to protest for stronger climate action — this movement is called "Fridays for Future." Therefore the correct answer is option a: Fridays for Future. The other options are incorrect because "Earth Day" is an annual awareness event, "Save the Earth" is a generic phrase not the specific movement she founded, and "Greenpeace" is an established environmental organization rather than Thunberg’s student-led movement.

Question:
What is the main concern regarding water bodies discussed in the text?

Options:
a. Overfishing
b. Pollution
c. Drought
d. Flooding


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the text and identify the recurring issue — the passage repeatedly mentions contaminants, waste, chemical runoff, and harm to aquatic life, which points to pollution.  
Step 2: Match this observation to the options: that description directly corresponds to option (b) Pollution.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out others: overfishing would focus on fish harvesting, drought on low water levels, and flooding on excess water; none of those fit the text’s emphasis on contamination. Therefore the correct answer is (b) Pollution.

Question:
Which river is highlighted as an example of pollution in Bangladesh?

Options:
a. Ganges
b. Buriganga
c. Brahmaputra
d. Jamuna


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize that the Buriganga River, which flows by Dhaka, is widely cited in Bangladesh as a prime example of severe water pollution due to industrial effluent, sewage discharge, and solid waste accumulation.
Step 2: Therefore the correct choice is option b (Buriganga).
Step 3: Briefly, the other rivers—Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Jamuna—are major transboundary rivers important for flow and irrigation; although they face pollution issues in places, they are not the commonly highlighted example of urban/industrial pollution in Bangladesh the way the Buriganga is.
