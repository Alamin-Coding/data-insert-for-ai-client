Question:
According to the articles on human rights, what is suggested as a necessary step to combat child labor in the coal mining industry?

Options:
a. Increasing wages for child workers.
b. Monitoring and enforcing child labor laws more effectively.
c. Providing additional job opportunities for children.
d. Implementing stricter punishments for adult workers.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central recommendation in human-rights articles about child labor in coal mining — they emphasize eliminating exploitation by strengthening legal protection and ensuring laws are followed.  
Step 2: Match that recommendation to the options: option b ("Monitoring and enforcing child labor laws more effectively") directly corresponds to strengthening enforcement and oversight.  
Step 3: Explain why the others are incorrect: option a (increasing wages for child workers) normalizes child work rather than ending it; option c (providing additional job opportunities for children) still treats children as workers instead of protecting their rights and education; option d (stricter punishments for adult workers) may help but is narrower than the comprehensive monitoring and enforcement approach recommended.  

Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
According to Frederick Douglass, why were many slaves unaware of their ages?

Options:
a. Their masters kept records hidden.
b. They were not allowed to ask about it.
c. They were educated about their history.
d. They were born in different territories.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim in Frederick Douglass’s narrative — he repeatedly notes that slaves often did not know their exact ages because the slaveholders refused to give that information and discouraged questions about personal history.  
Step 2: Match that claim to the options: option (b) “They were not allowed to ask about it” directly states the reason Douglass gives.  
Step 3: Explain why other options are wrong: (a) “Their masters kept records hidden” is similar but implies secret records rather than the active prohibition on asking; (c) “They were educated about their history” is opposite to the truth; (d) “They were born in different territories” is irrelevant to not knowing ages.  

Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
Which human rights are most commonly violated among adolescents in Bangladesh according to recent studies?

Options:
a. Right to education and freedom of expression
b. Right to asylum and a nationality
c. Right to marry and found a family
d. Right to privacy and freedom of assembly


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
1. Step 1 — Identify common violations from recent studies: surveys and reports on Bangladeshi adolescents repeatedly highlight high school dropout rates, limited access to quality education, and restrictions on young people’s ability to voice opinions or participate (e.g., censorship, social pressure, limited youth participation).  
2. Step 2 — Match findings to options: those findings correspond directly to the "right to education" and "freedom of expression," which is a.  
3. Step 3 — Briefly rule out other choices: b (asylum/nationality) is mainly relevant for refugees, not the general adolescent population; c (right to marry) relates to child marriage issues but is less broadly reported than education/expression violations; d (privacy/assembly) are reported less frequently as the primary, widespread problems.  

Therefore the correct answer is a.

Question:
Which article grants the right to seek asylum from persecution?

Options:
a. Article 12
b. Article 14
c. Article 15
d. Article 18


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
1. Step 1: Identify the source — the right to seek asylum from persecution is stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).
2. Step 2: Recall the UDHR text — Article 14 explicitly provides the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.
3. Step 3: Match to the options — that corresponds to option b, Article 14.

Explanation of incorrect options: Article 12 deals with protection from arbitrary interference with privacy, Article 15 concerns the right to a nationality, and Article 18 concerns freedom of thought, conscience and religion; none of these grant the specific right to seek asylum.

b. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy.
c. Everyone has the right to seek asylum.
d. Marriage shall be entered into only with consent.

Solution:

Step 2: Compare this text with the options—option (b) directly matches Article 12.  
Step 3: Conclude that (b) is correct.  

Briefly why the others are incorrect: (a) refers to the right to a nationality (Article 15), (c) refers to the right to seek asylum from persecution (Article 14), and (d) refers to marriage consent (Article 16).

Question:
According to the text, what is a violation of human rights?

Options:
a. Freedom of assembly.
b. Child labor.
c. Right to nationality.
d. Freedom of opinion.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Explanation:
Step 1: A human-rights violation is an action or practice that infringes on the basic rights and freedoms entitled to people (e.g., exploitation, denial of education, forced labor).  
Step 2: Evaluate the options: child labor is the exploitation of children and denial of their rights (education, development, protection) — this is a clear violation.  
Step 3: The other options — freedom of assembly, right to nationality, and freedom of opinion — are themselves human rights, not violations.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) Child labor.

Options:

Correct Answer: ক

Step 2: That definition matches option a, so a is correct.  
Step 3: Options b, c, and d are incorrect because "asylum" is not a type of nationality, not a form of marriage, and while it may involve legal procedures, it is not itself a single legal document.

Options:
a. Freedom of speech.
b. Protection against abuse.
c. Right to education.
d. Right to work.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the statement in the text that describes aims of social activism — it emphasizes safeguarding vulnerable groups and ensuring protection against mistreatment, which corresponds to option b.

Step 2: Reasoning — social activism often focuses on preventing abuse and providing protection, so "protection against abuse" is a key element explicitly mentioned.

Step 3: Why other options are incorrect — option a (freedom of speech) and options c (right to education) and d (right to work) are important social rights but the text specifically highlighted protection against abuse as the central element, so they are not the best answers here.

Answer: b (Protection against abuse).

What does the term 'child labor' refer to in the context of human rights?

Options:
a. Children working in safe environments.
b. Children being denied education.
c. Children working under abusive conditions.
d. Children participating in sports.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Define the term — child labor refers to situations where children are engaged in work that is harmful to their physical, mental or moral development, or that prevents them from receiving education and enjoying a normal childhood.
Step 2: Compare each option to that definition:
- Option a: "Children working in safe environments" can be permissible work (e.g., light, non-harmful tasks) and does not capture the abusive or harmful aspect of child labor.
- Option b: "Children being denied education" describes one consequence of child labor but is not the full definition by itself.
- Option c: "Children working under abusive conditions" matches the core idea of child labor — work that is exploitative, dangerous, or detrimental to a child’s wellbeing.
- Option d: "Children participating in sports" is unrelated and not harmful.
Step 3: Conclude — therefore the correct answer is c because it directly describes harmful and exploitative work conditions that constitute child labor.

What is the role of the United Nations in relation to human rights?

Options:
a. To enforce laws.
b. To promote and protect human rights.
c. To manage governments.
d. To provide education.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the UN’s mandate — one of its core roles is to promote and protect human rights worldwide through instruments (e.g., the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) and bodies like the Human Rights Council and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  
Step 2: Match that role to the options: option (b) “To promote and protect human rights” directly describes these functions.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out the others: (a) “To enforce laws” is incorrect because the UN cannot directly enforce domestic laws (it can recommend, sanction or authorize actions in specific cases); (c) “To manage governments” is wrong because the UN does not run or control sovereign governments; (d) “To provide education” is partially true in that the UN supports education programs, but this is not its primary role regarding human rights.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
What does the term 'violation of privacy' mean?

Options:
a. Protection of personal information.
b. Interference with personal life.
c. Freedom of expression.
d. Right to education.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Understand the term — a "violation of privacy" means unlawful or unwanted interference with a person's private life, personal information, or private space.  
Step 2: Compare definitions to options and choose the one that matches: option b ("Interference with personal life") directly describes that interference, so it is correct.  
Why the others are wrong: option a ("Protection of personal information") is the opposite of a violation; option c ("Freedom of expression") and option d ("Right to education") refer to different rights and are unrelated to the meaning of privacy violation.

Question:
What does Article 3 guarantee?

Options:
a. Right to freedom of speech.
b. Right to life, liberty, and security.
c. Right to education.
d. Right to work.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the text of Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: it states that "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person."  
Step 2: Match this wording to the choices — option (b) "Right to life, liberty, and security" exactly matches Article 3, so that is the correct answer.  
Brief note on other options: (a) freedom of speech is Article 19, (c) right to education is Article 26, and (d) right to work is covered by Article 23; these do not match Article 3.

Question:
How does the text define 'freedom of thought'?

Options:
a. The ability to express opinions.
b. The right to practice religion.
c. The right to education.
d. The ability to think independently.


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Interpret the term "freedom of thought" as the autonomy to form one's own beliefs and ideas without external coercion.  
Step 2: Compare options: a refers to expressing opinions (freedom of expression), b refers to practicing religion (freedom of religion), c refers to access to schooling (right to education), while d matches the internal ability to think independently.  
Therefore the correct answer is d, because it directly describes the mental independence implied by "freedom of thought," and the other choices describe different rights.

Question:
What is the significance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?

Options:
a. It outlines the rights of individuals.
b. It provides a legal framework for governments.
c. It is a historical document.
d. It promotes economic growth.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the primary purpose of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The UDHR was adopted to enumerate and articulate the fundamental rights and freedoms that every individual should enjoy.

Step 2: Compare this purpose with the options. Option (a) "It outlines the rights of individuals" matches the UDHR's main function. Option (b) is incorrect because the UDHR is not a binding legal framework—it's an influential international proclamation that informs laws but does not itself create enforceable legal obligations for states. Option (c) is partially true (it is a historical document), but that describes its nature, not its primary significance. Option (d) is incorrect because promoting economic growth is not the UDHR's focus.

Conclusion: The correct answer is a.
