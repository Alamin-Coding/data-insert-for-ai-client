Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
সমাধান: সঠিক উত্তর হলো b — রোকেয়া সখাওয়াত হোসেন। তিনি বঙ্গের উন্নত শিক্ষিকা ও নারী অধিকারের প্রবক্তা ছিলেন, বেগম রোকেয়া নামে পরিচিত, মেয়েদের শিক্ষার জন্য সখাওয়াত মেমোরিয়াল গার্লস স্কুল প্রতিষ্ঠা করেন এবং নারীবাদী লেখনী (যেমন "সুলতানার স্বপ্ন") রচনা করে নারী উত্তোলনে ভূমিকা রেখেছেন। অন্যান্যরা ভুল কারণ ভিরজিনিয়া উলফ একজন ইংরেজ সাহিত্যিক ও আধুনিকতাবাদী লেখক হলেও তিনি বঙ্গীয় প্রেক্ষাপটে নারী শিক্ষাব্যবস্থার সৃষ্টিকারী নন; লীলা নাগ ও নাদেরা বেগম উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে বঙ্গীয় নারী শিক্ষা ও অধিকার আন্দোলনের সাথে জড়িত পরিচিত নাম নয়।

Question:
Which of the following best describes the legacy of Wangari Maathai?

Options:
a. Promoting industrialization.
b. Advocating for environmental conservation and women's rights.
c. Focusing on urban development.
d. Encouraging traditional farming methods.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall Wangari Maathai’s work — she founded the Green Belt Movement, led large-scale tree-planting and conservation efforts in Kenya, and championed women’s political and social rights, earning a Nobel Prize for her combined environmental and human-rights work.  
Step 2: Compare with options: option b directly matches her advocacy for environmental conservation and women’s rights.  
Step 3: Why others are incorrect: option a (promoting industrialization) and option c (focusing on urban development) do not reflect her emphasis on grassroots environmentalism, and option d (encouraging traditional farming methods) is not the primary focus of her legacy.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Question:
What was one of the main strategies of the ANC in their struggle against apartheid?

Options:
a. Violent protests.
b. Constitutional struggle and peaceful protests.
c. Negotiating with foreign governments.
d. Ignoring the laws.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the ANC's primary tactics — mobilising mass non‑racial movements, organising strikes, boycotts and civil disobedience, and pursuing legal and political campaigns to change discriminatory laws.  
Step 2: Compare these tactics to the options: option b ("Constitutional struggle and peaceful protests") directly matches the ANC's main strategy of nonviolent political and legal struggle.  
Therefore the correct answer is b. Option a is misleading because while some armed actions occurred later, the ANC is best known for its constitutional and peaceful campaigns; options c and d do not capture the ANC’s central strategy.

Question:
What does the phrase 'let freedom ring' signify in King's speech?

Options:
a. Call for economic prosperity.
b. Demand for racial equality and justice.
c. A wish for global peace.
d. A request for political change.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1 — Identify context: In Martin Luther King Jr.’s "I Have a Dream" speech, the repeated phrase "let freedom ring" occurs in a passage calling for freedom from segregation, discrimination, and racial injustice across the United States.
Step 2 — Interpret meaning: The phrase is a call for civil rights—an insistence that freedom and equal treatment be extended to African Americans and all oppressed groups, i.e., racial equality and justice.
Step 3 — Choose the best option: This matches option b (Demand for racial equality and justice). 

Brief why others are incorrect: 
- a (economic prosperity): King did discuss economic issues elsewhere, but "let freedom ring" primarily addresses civil and racial freedom, not general economic growth. 
- c (global peace): The line is focused on domestic civil rights rather than a wish for worldwide peace. 
- d (political change): While political change is related, the phrase specifically emphasizes racial justice and equal freedom, so b is the most accurate.

Question:
What impact did Leela Nag have on women's education in Bangladesh?

Options:
a. She founded the first university.
b. She established schools for girls.
c. She wrote textbooks.
d. She was a political leader.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question focus — "impact on women's education in Bangladesh" — and identify which option directly affects girls' access to education.
Step 2: Choose option (b) because establishing schools for girls directly increases educational opportunities, enrollment, and literacy among women, which is a clear and direct impact.
Step 3: Quickly rule out others: (a) founding the first university is not specific to women’s education, (c) writing textbooks is supportive but less directly about access, and (d) being a political leader does not necessarily imply direct contributions to girls’ schooling. Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Question:
What was a significant challenge faced by women like Marie Curie in their careers?

Options:
a. Lack of funding for research.
b. Gender discrimination in a male-dominated field.
c. Limited access to education.
d. Political instability.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the historical facts — Marie Curie worked in a late 19th/early 20th-century scientific world dominated by men and faced barriers to equal treatment.  
Step 2: Reasoning — gender discrimination affected hiring, recognition, and access to positions and resources for women scientists, so this was a significant and well-documented challenge for her.  
Step 3: Eliminate other options — while funding and education could be issues, Curie did obtain advanced education and research funding at times; political instability was not the primary career obstacle.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) Gender discrimination in a male-dominated field.

What is the main subject of the speeches discussed in the text?

Options:
a. Environmental issues.
b. Civil rights and social justice.
c. Economic policies.
d. Educational reforms.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the text for central themes — the speeches repeatedly mention equality, discrimination, voting rights, and calls for justice, which point to civil rights and social justice as the main subject.  
Step 2: Match those themes to the options: b ("Civil rights and social justice") directly corresponds to equality and justice concerns.  
Step 3: Briefly explain why other options are incorrect: environmental issues (a) would focus on climate or pollution, economic policies (c) would discuss budgets or markets, and educational reforms (d) would center on schools and curriculum — none of these are the central topics in the speeches.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

What was the primary goal of the Green Belt Movement?

Options:
a. To promote women's rights.
b. To plant trees and conserve the environment.
c. To educate children.
d. To provide healthcare.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the Green Belt Movement, founded by Wangari Maathai in Kenya, whose central activity was mobilizing people to plant trees to restore forests and conserve the environment.  
Step 2: The primary goal was environmental conservation through tree planting and sustainable resource management, so the correct answer is b.  
Explanation: While the movement also empowered women (related to option a) and improved livelihoods, its main focus was tree planting and conservation; options c and d (education and healthcare) were not the movement’s primary objectives.

Question:
What did Marie Curie achieve that was significant for women in science?

Options:
a. First woman to win a Nobel Prize.
b. First woman to teach at the Sorbonne.
c. First woman to discover a new element.
d. First woman to work in a laboratory.


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Read the question focus — a milestone "significant for women in science" usually refers to a barrier‑breaking public recognition.  
Step 2: Recall facts about Marie Curie — in 1903 she became the first woman awarded a Nobel Prize (Physics), and later won a second Nobel (Chemistry) in 1911. That first Nobel made her the first female Nobel laureate, a major breakthrough for women in science.  
Conclusion: therefore the correct answer is a.

Brief note on the other options:
- b: She did later become a professor at the Sorbonne, but the prize is the more widely cited barrier‑breaking recognition.  
- c: She discovered polonium and radium, but the question asks about the achievement significant specifically as a milestone for women in science (the Nobel was that landmark).  
- d: Many women had worked in laboratories before; being the first woman to win a Nobel Prize is the distinct, pioneering achievement.

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the event — on August 28, 1963 Martin Luther King Jr. delivered the "I Have a Dream" speech during the March on Washington.

Conclusion: therefore the correct answer is b (it addressed racial equality and civil rights).  
Why others are incorrect: (a) concerns Vietnam and came later in some contexts, (c) economic reforms were not the primary focus of this speech, and (d) environmental issues were unrelated.

Options:
a. Economic independence.
b. Freedom from oppression.
c. Political power.
d. Social equality.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Step 1: Identify the core meaning of "emancipation" — it commonly means liberation or release from control, servitude, or oppressive restrictions.  
Step 2: Compare this meaning with the options: option (b) "Freedom from oppression" matches exactly.  
Step 3: Explain why others are less accurate: option (a) "Economic independence" and option (c) "Political power" are specific types of autonomy that can result from emancipation but do not capture the general sense; option (d) "Social equality" is related but is a broader societal condition rather than the act or state of being freed.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b).

Step 2: Compare that description to the options — option b ("Defending the rights of African people") directly matches Mandela’s stated focus.  
Therefore the correct answer is b.

Brief note on other options: a (promoting capitalism) and c (establishing a monarchy) do not reflect ANC’s liberation goals, and d (fostering international relations) was a secondary activity but not the ANC’s primary focus as described by Mandela.

Which movement is associated with Wangari Maathai?

Options:
a. Green Belt Movement
b. Civil Rights Movement
c. Anti-Apartheid Movement
d. Women's Suffrage Movement


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall who Wangari Maathai was — a Kenyan environmentalist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate known for grassroots tree-planting and community empowerment.  
Step 2: Match that to the movements listed: the Green Belt Movement was founded by Maathai to plant trees, stop deforestation, and empower women, so the correct choice is (a) Green Belt Movement.  
Why other options are incorrect: the Civil Rights Movement refers mainly to US racial equality struggles, the Anti-Apartheid Movement was centered on ending apartheid in South Africa, and the Women's Suffrage Movement aimed at voting rights in earlier periods — none of these were Maathai’s primary movement.

What was Marie Curie's first Nobel Prize awarded for?

Options:
a. Chemistry
b. Physics
c. Medicine
d. Literature


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recall the historical facts — Marie Curie received two Nobel Prizes: the first in 1903 and the second in 1911.  
Step 2: The 1903 prize was awarded jointly to Henri Becquerel, Pierre Curie, and Marie Curie "in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena" — this is a Nobel Prize in Physics.  
Step 3: Therefore the correct answer is option b (Physics).  
Explanation of other options: the 1911 prize was in Chemistry (so option a refers to her second prize), and she never won Nobel Prizes in Medicine or Literature.

Solution:
Step 1: Recall that Wangari Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement and was internationally recognized for linking environmental conservation with human rights and democracy.

Step 3: Briefly rule out other choices: the Pulitzer Prize is for journalism, the Fields Medal is for mathematics, and the Oscar is for film—none match her contribution.  
Therefore the correct answer is option a: Nobel Peace Prize.

Options:
a. A type of economic policy.
b. A system of racial segregation in South Africa.
c. A form of government.
d. An educational reform.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution: 
Step 1: Recognize the historical context — Nelson Mandela’s speeches consistently condemned the system that legally enforced racial discrimination in South Africa.  
Step 2: Match the term to its known meaning — "apartheid" was the official policy of racial segregation and white minority rule in South Africa.  
Therefore the correct choice is (b) a system of racial segregation in South Africa.  
Other options are incorrect because apartheid was not primarily an economic policy (a), nor simply a generic form of government (c), nor an educational reform (d).

Question:
Which literary device is most frequently used in Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech?

Options:
a. Metaphor
b. Alliteration
c. Simile
d. Personification


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Step 1: Identify common rhetorical devices in Martin Luther King Jr.’s speech (metaphor, alliteration, simile, personification) and scan for recurring patterns.  
Step 2: Note that King repeatedly uses imagery that equates abstract social conditions with concrete objects or situations (e.g., calling the Constitution a “promissory note,” referring to “the valley of despair,” “the bright day of justice”), which are metaphors.  
Step 3: Because such figurative comparisons appear throughout the speech to structure major arguments and images, metaphor is the most frequently used device.  
Step 4: Why the others are less likely: alliteration appears only occasionally for emphasis, similes (“like” or “as” comparisons) are much rarer, and personification occurs sometimes but far less often than metaphor. Therefore the correct answer is (a) Metaphor.
