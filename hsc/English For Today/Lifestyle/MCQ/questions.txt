Question:
What is the main reason for practicing good table manners?

Options:
a. To impress others
b. To show respect to those around you
c. To follow social norms
d. To avoid conflicts


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:

Step 2: Compare options: (a) "To impress others" is a possible side effect but not the main reason; (c) "To follow social norms" describes how manners are expressed, not their fundamental purpose; (d) "To avoid conflicts" is a benefit, but a secondary one.  
Step 3: Therefore the best answer is (b) "To show respect to those around you," because respect and consideration are the core reasons for practicing good table manners.

Question:
What should you consider before making a purchase?

Options:
a. How it looks
b. If it is on sale
c. If you can do without it
d. How others will perceive it


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Before buying, ask whether the item is a need or just a want—this checks whether you can manage without it.  
Step 2: Compare the options: appearance (a), sale price (b), ability to do without (c), and others' opinions (d).  
Conclusion: The most important consideration is c — if you can do without it; choosing this prevents unnecessary spending. Options a, b, and d are secondary factors and can lead to impulse purchases if relied on alone.

How can advertising influence consumer behavior?

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: লক্ষ্য করুন যে বিজ্ঞাপনের প্রধান উদ্দেশ্য হলো ভোক্তার মনোভাব ও আচরণ প্রভাবিত করা — তা সচেতনতা বাড়ানো, আগ্রহ সৃষ্টি করা এবং ক্রয়ের তাড়না জাগানো।  
Step 2: বিজ্ঞাপন প্রায়ই তাত্পর্যপূর্ণ অনুভূতি, সীমিত সময়ের অফার বা "দারুণ সুযোগ" দেখিয়ে তৎক্ষণাত প্রয়োজনের অনুভূতি সৃষ্টি করে, তাই এটি ভোক্তাকে তাৎক্ষণিকভাবে ক্রয় করার দিকে ধাবিত করতে পারে — এ কারণেই সঠিক উত্তর (b)।  
Step 3: অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলোর কারণ সংক্ষেপে: (a) তথ্য দেওয়াই এক লক্ষ্য কিন্তু সরাসরি ক্রয়-উদ্দীপনা সৃষ্টিতে সবসময় প্রধান নয়; (c) বিপরীতভাবে ক্রয় না করাতে বিজ্ঞাপন সাধারণত চেষ্টা করে না; (d) সঞ্চয় প্রচার করা খাটো ক্ষেত্রে হয়, কিন্তু এটি সাধারণভাবে ভোক্তা আচরণ প্রভাবিত করার প্রধান কৌশল নয়।

Question:
What is the best way to control spending habits?

Options:
a. Buy everything you want
b. Ask if you need it
c. Use credit cards wisely
d. Follow advertisements


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: লক্ষ্য নির্ধারণ — খরচ নিয়ন্ত্রণের উদ্দেশ্য হলো অপ্রয়োজনীয় খরচ এড়িয়ে অর্থসংরক্ষণ ও বাজেট মেনে চলা।  
Step 2: বিকল্প বিশ্লেষণ — (a) সবকিছু কেনা অপ্রয়োজনীয় ব্যয় বাড়ায়; (b) “প্রয়োজন আছে কি?” জিজ্ঞাসা করলে ক্রয় সিদ্ধান্তে সযত্নতা আসে এবং অপ্রয়োজনীয় খরচ কমে; (c) ক্রেডিট কার্ড বুদ্ধিমত ব্যবহার সহায়ক কিন্তু তা ভাঙিয়ে নিলে খরচ নিয়ন্ত্রণে ব্যর্থ হতে পারে; (d) বিজ্ঞাপন অনুসরণ করলে প্রলোভনে পড়ে অনায়াসে খরচ বাড়ে।  
Step 3: সিদ্ধান্ত — সর্বোত্তম পদ্ধতি হলো (b) Ask if you need it, কারণ এটি সিদ্ধান্ত নেবার সময় সংযম বাড়ায় এবং অপ্রয়োজনীয় ব্যয় কমায়।

Question:
What is a potential consequence of overspending?

Options:
a. Increased happiness
b. Financial ruin
c. Better relationships
d. Enhanced lifestyle


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Define overspending — spending more than one's available resources. A simple budget identity is [math]Income - Spending = Savings[/math].  
Step 2: If spending exceeds income so that [math]Spending > Income[/math], then [math]Savings < 0[/math], which means accumulating debt or depleting emergency funds. That leads to financial stress and can escalate to financial ruin.  
Therefore the correct answer is b. Options a and c (increased happiness, better relationships) and d (enhanced lifestyle) may occur temporarily but are not reliable consequences of overspending and are outweighed by the financial risks.

Question:
What is a common mistake made by beginners in meditation?

Options:
a. Worrying about doing it right
b. Practicing too often
c. Not focusing enough
d. Meditating in a noisy environment


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Beginners often bring performance anxiety into meditation — they worry whether they are “doing it right.”  
Step 2: That worry becomes a form of mental activity that prevents the relaxed, nonjudgmental awareness meditation requires, so it’s a common and primary obstacle.  
Step 3: The other choices are less central: practicing too often is unlikely to be a beginner’s problem, “not focusing enough” is usually a symptom of the worry rather than the root cause, and noisy environments can be managed or avoided but aren’t a universal beginner mistake.  
Therefore the correct answer is a: Worrying about doing it right.

Question:
What is the main focus of meditation according to the text?

Options:
a. To achieve nirvana
b. To clear the mind and focus
c. To impress others
d. To follow religious practices


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the central claim — the text describes the practice and purpose of meditation.  
Step 2: Extract the primary emphasis — the text stresses calming mental chatter and cultivating concentrated attention, i.e., clearing the mind and focusing.  
Step 3: Conclude and rule out alternatives — achieving nirvana is a broader spiritual goal (not the immediate focus described), impressing others is unrelated, and following religious practices may be incidental but not the main point.  
Therefore the correct answer is (b) To clear the mind and focus.

Question:
What is the recommended approach when served food you dislike?

Options:
a. Refuse to eat it
b. Eat as much as you can
c. Take a small portion to taste
d. Leave it untouched


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Consider social etiquette and personal comfort — when someone serves you food, a polite response balances respect for the host and your own preferences.  
Step 2: Taking a small portion to taste allows you to show appreciation and avoid offending the host while not forcing yourself to eat a whole serving.  
Therefore the best choice is c. Options a, b, and d are less appropriate because outright refusal can be rude (a), eating as much as you can may make you uncomfortable or wasteful (b), and leaving it untouched can seem disrespectful or wasteful (d).

Question:
What is the significance of the phrase 'fool' in Egyptian cuisine?

Options:
a. It refers to foolish people
b. It means a type of broad bean dish
c. It is a term for a restaurant
d. It is a greeting


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize that "fool" in the context of Egyptian cuisine refers to the Arabic word often transliterated as "ful" or "fuul."  
Step 2: Recall that "ful medames" is a traditional Egyptian dish made from cooked broad (fava) beans and is a staple breakfast/meal in Egypt.  
Step 3: Therefore the phrase denotes a type of broad bean dish, so the correct answer is option b.

Explanation of other options: Option a is incorrect because it is not about foolish people; option c is wrong because it is not a term for a restaurant; option d is incorrect because it is not a greeting.

Question:
What is a common dining practice in Chinese culture?

Options:
a. Making noise while eating
b. Using chopsticks without any rules
c. Not making noise while eating soup
d. Eating with hands


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the cultural norm — Chinese dining etiquette generally values polite, quiet behavior at the table, especially when consuming soups or shared dishes.  
Step 2: Choose the option that matches this norm — c "Not making noise while eating soup" correctly reflects the expectation of eating respectfully and without loud noises.  
Step 3: Briefly rule out the others — a "Making noise while eating" is usually considered rude, b "Using chopsticks without any rules" is incorrect because there are specific chopstick manners, and d "Eating with hands" is not the typical practice in formal Chinese dining.

Question:
What is a common misconception about good manners?

Options:
a. They are universal
b. They are only necessary in formal settings
c. They can vary by culture
d. They are not important


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the claim in b: "They are only necessary in formal settings." This is a misconception because good manners are important in everyday, informal interactions as well — they build respect, trust and smooth communication in all contexts.  
Step 2: Why b is correct here: many people mistakenly limit manners to ceremonies or formal events, but polite behavior matters in casual, work, and family situations too.  
Step 3: Brief note on other options: c ("They can vary by culture") is true (so not a misconception); a ("They are universal") is false but less often the intended answer here; d ("They are not important") is clearly incorrect because manners facilitate positive interactions.

Question:
What is considered a polite way to refuse a gift in some cultures?

Options:
a. Accept it with both hands
b. Politely refuse it
c. Ignore it
d. Return it immediately


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the cultural norm described — in some cultures, refusing a gift politely is a sign of modesty or respect rather than rudeness.  
Step 2: Evaluate the options: accepting with both hands (a) is a way to accept, not refuse; ignoring (c) is rude; returning immediately (d) can offend the giver.  
Step 3: Therefore the best choice is (b) politely refuse it, because this matches the described polite custom and allows the giver to show persistence or insistence appropriately.

Question:
What should you do if you need to leave the table during a meal?

Options:
a. Ask for permission
b. Leave quietly without disturbing others
c. Announce where you are going
d. Wait until everyone else has finished


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Consider basic table etiquette — when you must leave during a meal, the goal is to be polite while minimizing disruption to others.  
Step 2: The best practice is to leave quietly without disturbing others, so option b is correct.  
Step 3: Option a (ask for permission) is usually unnecessary except in very formal settings; option c (announce where you are going) can draw attention and disrupt the meal; option d (wait until everyone has finished) is impractical if you have a pressing reason to leave.

Question:
What is the importance of table manners according to Kyle Ingham?

Options:
a. They are just arbitrary rules
b. They reflect one's upbringing and respect for others
c. They are not important
d. They are only needed at formal events


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the main point of Kyle Ingham’s view — he emphasizes that table manners reveal something about a person’s background and how they treat others.  
Step 2: Match that idea to the options: option b states they “reflect one's upbringing and respect for others,” which directly matches Ingham’s point, so b is correct.  
Step 3: Why the others are wrong: option a (“just arbitrary rules”) and option c (“not important”) contradict the idea that manners convey character and respect; option d (“only needed at formal events”) wrongly limits their significance to special occasions.

Options:
a. Start eating before the host
b. Eat with your left hand
c. Wait for the oldest man to start
d. Use chopsticks


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize common British dining etiquette — guests are expected to wait for the host (or the senior/eldest person present) to begin eating.  
Step 2: Compare options: (a) is incorrect because starting before the host is considered rude; (b) is incorrect because there is no rule to eat with the left hand; (d) is incorrect because chopsticks are used only for specific cuisines, not a general British practice.  
Conclusion: therefore the correct answer is (c) — wait for the oldest man (or host/senior person) to start.

Question:
Which hand is used to eat food in Middle Eastern cultures?

Options:
a. Left hand
b. Right hand
c. Both hands
d. Either hand


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Step 1: Observe cultural practice — in many Middle Eastern societies (influenced by Islamic etiquette and longstanding social customs) people are taught to use the right hand for eating for reasons of hygiene and respect.  
Step 2: Apply that rule to the options — the correct choice is "Right hand."  
Step 3: Why other options are incorrect — "Left hand" is generally avoided for eating because it is traditionally used for cleaning oneself; "Both hands" or "Either hand" do not reflect the prevailing cultural preference for the right hand.

Answer: b (Right hand)

Question:
What should you do before starting to eat at a formal dinner?

Options:
a. Wait for everyone to be served
b. Start eating immediately
c. Ask the host if you can start
d. Serve yourself first


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Solution:
Step 1: Recognize the norm of formal dining etiquette — meals at formal dinners are usually communal and coordinated.  
Step 2: Wait until everyone at the table has been served (or the host gives a signal) before you begin eating; this shows respect and ensures a synchronized, polite start.  
Why (a) is correct: it follows customary etiquette and avoids appearing rude. Options (b), (c), and (d) are inappropriate because starting immediately is inconsiderate, repeatedly asking the host is unnecessary if they signal, and serving yourself first breaks the formal order.

Step 2: Compare options: option b ("Salaam alaykum") is the traditional, region-wide greeting, so it is correct.  
Step 3: Other options are incorrect because "Hello" and "Goodbye" are English words not specific to the region, and "How are you?" is a generic question rather than the customary Arabic greeting.
