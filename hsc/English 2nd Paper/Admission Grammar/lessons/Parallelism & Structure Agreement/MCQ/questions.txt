Question:
She finished her work, locked the door and ____ home.

Options:
a. has gone
b. had gone
c. gone
d. went


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
The sentence lists actions in the simple past (finished, locked), so the final verb must also be in the simple past: 'went home.'

Explanation:
Parallelism requires that verbs in a list share the same tense and form. 'Finished' and 'locked' are simple past verbs, so the correct form for the last action is the simple past 'went' (went home). 'Has gone' is present perfect, 'had gone' is past perfect and would change the time relation, and 'gone' is a past participle needing an auxiliary verb.

Question:
Her daily routine includes cooking dinner, doing laundry and — the baby.

Options:
a. to feed
b. feed
c. feeding
d. having fed


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
c. feeding

Explanation:
The items in the list ('cooking', 'doing') are gerunds. To maintain parallel structure, the third item must also be a gerund: 'feeding'. 'To feed' is an infinitive, 'feed' is the base form and doesn't match the gerund pattern, and 'having fed' is a perfect participle implying completion, so none fit as well as 'feeding'.

Question:
He is interested in painting, sculpting and —

Options:
a. to draw
b. drawing
c. drew
d. draw


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
The correct form is 'drawing' because it is a gerund that matches the other -ing forms 'painting' and 'sculpting' following the preposition 'in'.

Explanation:
After the preposition 'in' a noun or gerund is required. The list shows parallel gerunds ('painting', 'sculpting'), so the final item must also be a gerund ('drawing'). Forms like 'to draw', 'drew', or the base verb 'draw' do not maintain the required grammatical parallelism or the gerund form after 'in'.
