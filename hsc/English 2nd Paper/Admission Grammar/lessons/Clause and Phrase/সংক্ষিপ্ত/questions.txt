Question:
We must buy the tickets next week.

Options:


Correct Answer: C.

Explanation:
"Must" expresses a present obligation, and using "next week" simply gives the time when that obligation should be fulfilled. Therefore option C is correct because it properly combines a strong necessity ("must") with the future time phrase "next week" to show you need to buy the tickets then.
