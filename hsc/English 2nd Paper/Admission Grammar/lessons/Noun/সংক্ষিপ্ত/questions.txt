Question:
I must acknowledge I have ---------- notion of what it means to be pleasant to everyone.

Options:


Correct Answer: C.

Solution:
আমি স্বীকার করছি আমার সামান্য ধারণা আছে অর্থাৎ, I must acknowledge I have little notion

Explanation:
C is correct because "no notion" properly negates "notion" to mean "not at all aware," which fits the sentence. Other choices would require an article or change the meaning, but "no notion of what it means to be pleasant to everyone" is the natural, grammatically correct phrase.
