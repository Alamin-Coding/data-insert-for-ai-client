(e) The idle can do little for society, ----?

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Nobody was present yesterday, were they?
Explanation: "Nobody" is a negative indefinite, so the tag must be positive; we commonly use the plural pronoun "they" with past "were."

(b) I am an SSC examinee, aren't I?
Explanation: After "I am" the usual question tag is "aren't I?" because "amn't I?" is not used in standard English.

(c) Don't tell a lie, will you?
Explanation: Negative imperatives take a positive tag, so "will you?" is used to soften the command.

(d) The widower shut the door, didn't he?
Explanation: Past simple affirmative requires a negative tag with "didn't" and the pronoun "he" for "the widower."

(e) The idle can do little for society, can't they?
Explanation: "The idle" refers to people (plural), and a positive modal "can" takes a negative tag "can't" with "they."
