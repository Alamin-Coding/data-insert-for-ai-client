Question:
Environment implies a healthy natural balance in the air, water, animals, plants, and other natural resources. It contributes to the existence and development of organisms but does the opposite if pollution occures. Pollution is the process of creating the environment dirty by adding harmful substances into it. Industrialization and other anthropogenic activities constantly pollute the environment and harm nature, posing serious threat to the existence of mankind. The increase of world population implies growth of industries, and industrial units release toxic gases and filthy poisonous effluents. Besides, trees are cut down for fuel, various commercial purposes, and building houses, reducing the supply of oxygen. Consequently, the shelter of birds and other animals is destroyed and ultimately the ecological balance is upset. Therefore, environment saving scientific methods should be adopted in development activities and environment protecting rules and regulations need to be, enacted towards reducing emissions of toxic gases and poisonous effluents.

According to the extract, what affects the stock of oxygen?

Options:


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
আলোচ্য passage টির Besides, trees are cut down for fuel, various commercial purposes ------------------ reducing the supply of oxygen অংশে উত্তরটি রয়েছে।

Explanation:
Explanation: The passage says trees are cut down for fuel and other uses, "reducing the supply of oxygen." Trees and plants produce oxygen by photosynthesis, so removing them (deforestation) directly lowers the stock of oxygen in the environment.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
আলোচ্য passage টির Besides, trees are cut down for fuel, various commercial purposes ------------------ reducing the supply of oxygen অংশে উত্তরটি রয়েছে।

Explanation:
Cutting down trees reduces the number of plants that produce oxygen through photosynthesis, so the overall supply of oxygen falls. The passage explicitly says trees are felled for fuel and construction, which destroys forests and thus decreases the stock of oxygen.

Question:
Environment refers to the balanced relationship among air, water, animals, plants and other natural resources that sustains life. However, this balance is disturbed when pollution occurs. Rapid industrial growth, expanded transportation, and population increase have intensified the discharge of poisonous gases and contaminated effluents into nature. Vehicles and industrial units contribute to air pollution, while untreated waste contaminates water bodies. Large-scale felling of trees for fuel, commerce and construction reduces oxygen production and destroys habitats of birds and animals. Consequently, ecological harmony is upset. The passage recommends adopting scientific, environment-friendly methods in development and enforcing strict rules to curb emissions and effluents.

Options:
a. According to the passage, which human activity most directly reduces the production of oxygen?
b. Which source is identified as a primary emitter of toxic gases in the passage?
c. What immediate effect on wildlife is mentioned as a consequence of human activities?
d. What two broad measures does the passage recommend to control pollution?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Answer: Large-scale cutting down of trees (deforestation) — The passage states that trees are cut down for fuel, commercial purposes and building houses, which reduces the supply of oxygen.
b Answer: Industrial units/factories — The passage specifically mentions industrialization and industrial units releasing toxic gases and poisonous effluents.
c Answer: Destruction of shelter/habitats for birds and other animals — The passage explains that cutting trees destroys shelter and ultimately upsets ecological balance.
d Answer: (1) Adopt environment-saving scientific methods in development activities, and (2) Enact and enforce environment-protecting rules and regulations to reduce emissions and effluents.

Explanation:
a: Trees perform photosynthesis and are the primary large-scale producers of atmospheric oxygen; felling them reduces overall oxygen production, as the passage indicates.

b: The passage links industrialization and industrial units with the release of toxic gases and filthy effluents, identifying industry as a main pollution source.

c: Removal of trees and habitat destruction lead to loss of shelter for birds and other animals; this immediate effect is highlighted and connected to broader ecological imbalance.

d: The passage recommends a twofold approach — using scientific, environment-friendly methods during development (to reduce harmful outputs) and creating/enforcing legal regulations to limit emissions and effluent discharge. These measures together aim to control pollution and protect ecological balance.

Question #4 (ID: 582727)

Type: CQ | Book: English 2nd Paper | Years:  | Boards:  | Tags:

Question:
The natural environment comprises the air we breathe, rivers and oceans, forests, wildlife, and the minerals and soils that sustain life. However, human actions increasingly degrade these components: factories discharge untreated waste into waterways, vehicles emit exhaust fumes, agricultural runoff carries pesticides into ecosystems, and forests are cleared for farming and construction. These processes pollute air and water, destroy habitats, reduce biodiversity, and disrupt cycles that maintain life on Earth. To prevent further deterioration, it is proposed that cleaner technologies be adopted in production, strict pollution controls be enforced, and reforestation and conservation programs be promoted alongside public awareness campaigns.

Options:
a. According to the passage, which human action directly contaminates rivers and harms aquatic life?
b. Which activity mentioned in the passage most directly leads to loss of animal shelter and reduced biodiversity?
c. What is the passage’s stated outcome when air and water become polluted?
d. Which solution does the passage recommend to reduce harmful emissions from industries?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Discharging untreated waste (industrial effluents) into waterways directly contaminates rivers and harms aquatic life.

b Clearing forests (deforestation for farming and construction) most directly leads to loss of animal shelter and reduced biodiversity.

c The passage states that pollution of air and water destroys habitats, reduces biodiversity, and disrupts life-supporting cycles — ultimately degrading the environment and threatening life.

d The passage recommends adopting cleaner technologies in production and enforcing strict pollution controls to reduce harmful industrial emissions.

Explanation:
a) The passage explicitly cites factories discharging untreated waste into waterways as an example of pollution that contaminates rivers; such effluents contain chemicals and toxins that kill or impair aquatic organisms. b) It mentions forests being cleared for farming and construction; removing trees destroys shelter and food sources for animals, leading to reduced biodiversity. c) When air and water are polluted, the passage explains that habitats are destroyed and ecological cycles are disrupted, which harms organisms and threatens human existence. d) Among the proposed remedies, the passage highlights adopting cleaner technologies and enforcing strict pollution controls as ways to reduce toxic emissions from industries; these measures directly target the source of pollutants.
