Question:
Napoleon Bonaparte's ambition to control all the area around the Mediterranean Sea led him and his French soldiers to Egypt. After losing a naval battle, they were forced to remain there for three years. In 1799, while constructing a fort, a soldier discovered a piece of steel (stone pillar bearing an inscription) know as the Rosetta stone. This famous stone, which would eventually lead to the deciphering of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics dating to 3100 B. C., was written in three languages : hieroglyphics (picture writting), demotic ( a shorthand version of hieroglyphics), and Greek, Scientists discovered that the characters, unlike those in English, could be written from right to left and in other directions as well.

Twenty-three years after discovery of the Rosetta stone, Jean Francois Champollion, a French philologist, fluent in several languages, was able to decipher the fast word --------- Ptolemy --- name of an Egyption ruler. This name was written inside an oval called a "cartouche". Further investigation revealed that cartouches contained names of important people of that period. Champollion painstakingly continued his search and was able to increase his growing list of known phonetic signs. He and an Englishman Thomas Young, worked independently to each other to unravel the deeply hidden mysteries of this strange language; Young believed that sound values could be assigned to the symbols, while Champollion insisted the pictures represented words.

How many years elapsed between the date of the oldest hieroglyphics deciphered by means of the Rosetta stone and the stone's discovery?

Options:
A. 1301
B. 1799
C. 3100
D. 4899
E. 1300

Question:
Environment implies a healthy natural balance in the air, water, animals, plants, and other natural resources. It contributes to the existence and development of organisms but does the opposite if pollution occures. Pollution is the process of creating the environment dirty by adding harmful substances into it. Industrialization and other anthropogenic activities constantly pollute the environment and harm nature, posing serious threat to the existence of mankind. The increase of world population implies growth of industries, and industrial units release toxic gases and filthy poisonous effluents. Besides, trees are cut down for fuel, various commercial purposes, and building houses, reducing the supply of oxygen. Consequently, the shelter of birds and other animals is destroyed and ultimately the ecological balance is upset. Therefore, environment saving scientific methods should be adopted in development activities and environment protecting rules and regulations need to be, enacted towards reducing emissions of toxic gases and poisonous effluents.

The easy way to save the environment is:

Options:
A. planting trees and curbing industrial emissions
B. controlling industrial growth
C. implementing existing laws and regulations
D. developing shelters for birds and other animals

Question:
Children must pass through several stages in their lives to become adults. World Health Organisation (WHO) identifies adolescence as the period in human growth and development that occurs after childhood and before adulthood. This phase represents one of the critical transitions in one's life span and is characterized by fast paced growth and change which are second only to those at infancy. Biological processes drive many aspects of this growth aand development with the onset of puberty marking the passage from childhood to adolescence. The biological determinants of adolescence are fairly universal; however, the duration and defining characteristics of the period may very across time, cultures and socio-economic situations. this period has seen many changes over the past century-puberty for example, comes earlier than before, people marry late, and their sexual attitudes and behaviours are different from their grandparents, or even parents. Among the factors responsible for the change are education, urbanization and spread of global communication.

The time of adolescence is a period of preparation for adulthood during which one experiences several key developments. Besides physical and sexual maturation, these experiences include movement toward social and economic independence, development of indentity, the acquisition of skills needed to carry out adult relationships and roles and the capacity for abstract reasoning. While adolescence is a time of tremendous growth and potential, it is also a time of considerable risks during which social contexts exert powerful influences. Adolescents depend on their families, their communities, schools, health services and their workplaces to learn a wide range of skills that can help them to cope with the pressures they face and make a successful transition from childhood to adulthood.

Which one of the following statements is not true?

Options:
A. In past puberty would come in early stage of life
B. The features of adolescence may vary from society to society
C. Family can help an adolescent person to transit from childhood to adulthood
D. Adolescence is a period of great potentials

Question:
Environment implies a healthy natural balance in the air, water, animals, plants, and other natural resources. It contributes to the existence and development of organisms but does the opposite if pollution occures. Pollution is the process of creating the environment dirty by adding harmful substances into it. Industrialization and other anthropogenic activities constantly pollute the environment and harm nature, posing serious threat to the existence of mankind. The increase of world population implies growth of industries, and industrial units release toxic gases and filthy poisonous effluents. Besides, trees are cut down for fuel, various commercial purposes, and building houses, reducing the supply of oxygen. Consequently, the shelter of birds and other animals is destroyed and ultimately the ecological balance is upset. Therefore, environment saving scientific methods should be adopted in development activities and environment protecting rules and regulations need to be, enacted towards reducing emissions of toxic gases and poisonous effluents.

Question:
Napoleon Bonaparte's ambition to control all the area around the Mediterranean Sea led him and his French soldiers to Egypt. After losing a naval battle, they were forced to remain there for three years. In 1799, while constructing a fort, a soldier discovered a piece of steel (stone pillar bearing an inscription) know as the Rosetta stone. This famous stone, which would eventually lead to the deciphering of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics dating to 3100 B. C., was written in three languages : hieroglyphics (picture writting), demotic ( a shorthand version of hieroglyphics), and Greek, Scientists discovered that the characters, unlike those in English, could be written from right to left and in other directions as well.

Twenty-three years after discovery of the Rosetta stone, Jean Francois Champollion, a French philologist, fluent in several languages, was able to decipher the fast word --------- Ptolemy --- name of an Egyption ruler. This name was written inside an oval called a "cartouche". Further investigation revealed that cartouches contained names of important people of that period. Champollion painstakingly continued his search and was able to increase his growing list of known phonetic signs. He and an Englishman Thomas Young, worked independently to each other to unravel the deeply hidden mysteries of this strange language; Young believed that sound values could be assigned to the symbols, while Champollion insisted the pictures represented words.

Question:
Napoleon Bonaparte's ambition to control all the area around the Mediterranean Sea led him and his French soldiers to Egypt. After losing a naval battle, they were forced to remain there for three years. In 1799, while constructing a fort, a soldier discovered a piece of steel (stone pillar bearing an inscription) know as the Rosetta stone. This famous stone, which would eventually lead to the deciphering of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics dating to 3100 B. C., was written in three languages : hieroglyphics (picture writting), demotic ( a shorthand version of hieroglyphics), and Greek, Scientists discovered that the characters, unlike those in English, could be written from right to left and in other directions as well.

Twenty-three years after discovery of the Rosetta stone, Jean Francois Champollion, a French philologist, fluent in several languages, was able to decipher the fast word --------- Ptolemy --- name of an Egyption ruler. This name was written inside an oval called a "cartouche". Further investigation revealed that cartouches contained names of important people of that period. Champollion painstakingly continued his search and was able to increase his growing list of known phonetic signs. He and an Englishman Thomas Young, worked independently to each other to unravel the deeply hidden mysteries of this strange language; Young believed that sound values could be assigned to the symbols, while Champollion insisted the pictures represented words.

Question:
Adolescence is commonly described as the stage between childhood and adulthood during which individuals undergo rapid and wide-ranging changes. This period is characterized by marked physical growth, sexual maturation with the onset of puberty, and important psychosocial developments such as identity formation and increasing responsibility. Although the biological basis of puberty is broadly similar worldwide, the length and expression of adolescence vary across cultures, historical periods and socio-economic contexts. Adolescence also brings heightened vulnerability to health and social risks, and young people typically rely on families, schools, health services and communities to acquire the skills and support needed to navigate these challenges and to prepare for adult roles.

Which of the following is NOT conveyed by the passage?

Options:
ক/a/ا. Adolescence involves rapid physical, sexual and psychosocial changes.
খ/b/ب. Young people depend on family and community supports to develop coping skills.
গ/c/ج. Adolescents are fully self-reliant in learning how to cope with pressures without external help.
ঘ/d/ث. Puberty is a biological marker that signals the start of adolescence.


Correct Answer: গ/c/ج

Solution:
The passage emphasizes that adolescents rely on families, schools and communities to acquire skills; it does not claim they are fully self-reliant.

Explanation:
The passage highlights that adolescence is a time of increased risks and that young people depend on external supports (family, schools, health services, communities) to learn skills to cope and prepare for adulthood. Therefore the statement that adolescents are fully self-reliant contradicts the passage and is not conveyed by it.

Question:
The Behistun Inscription, a multilingual relief that proved crucial to deciphering cuneiform, was carved around 520 B.C. An English officer, Henry Rawlinson, copied its text in 1835, which allowed scholars to begin unlocking the script. How many years elapsed between the carving of the inscription and Rawlinson's copying of it?

Options:
a. 1315
b. 2355
c. 1365
d. 2365


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Add the years since 520 B.C. and 1835 A.D.: [math]520 + 1835 = 2355[/math] years.

Explanation:
Because the inscription date is given in B.C. (before Christ) and the copying took place in A.D., the elapsed time equals the sum of the two numbers. Thus [math]520\ (B.C.) + 1835\ (A.D.) = 2355[/math] years elapsed between carving and copying.

Question:
Scholars used one of the languages inscribed on the Rosetta Stone—because it was already known—to help decode Egyptian hieroglyphs. Which language on the stone provided this crucial reference?

Options:
a. Greek
b. Demotic
c. Latin
d. Coptic


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Greek

Explanation:
The Rosetta Stone contains the same decree written in three scripts: hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek. Because Greek was a well-understood language for European scholars, they could read the Greek text and use it as a key to identify names and phrases in the other scripts. This comparison allowed researchers like Champollion and Young to begin assigning phonetic values and meanings to hieroglyphic signs. Demotic and hieroglyphic were the Egyptian scripts on the stone; Coptic is a later stage of Egyptian used by scholars as background knowledge but is not one of the known languages that provided the direct readable comparison on the stone.

Question:
The Rosetta Stone bears the same decree in three scripts: hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek. Which of these provided scholars with a directly readable text that enabled them to identify names found in cartouches (such as 'Ptolemy') and thereby begin deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs?

Options:
a. Hieroglyphic
b. Demotic
c. Latin
d. Greek


Correct Answer: ঘ

Solution:
Greek

Explanation:
The Greek inscription was a known language to scholars, so they could read the content and match proper names and phrases to the unknown scripts. By finding names in the Greek text corresponding to names enclosed in cartouches on the hieroglyphic and demotic sections (for example the name 'Ptolemy'), scholars were able to link symbols to phonetic values. This bilingual/multiscript match-up was the crucial step that allowed Champollion and others to unravel Egyptian hieroglyphs.

According to the passage, the prevalent education system in these parts of the world most discourages students from-

Options:
a. participating actively in class
b. being obedient to their teachers
c. memorizing lessons
d. receiving special attention


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
The passage says children remain silent in class unless asked a question and cannot take charge of their education; they are encouraged to be obedient listeners, which indicates active participation is discouraged.

Explanation:
The passage describes a system that restricts freedom, promotes silence and obedience, and relies on rote memorization. These points show students are discouraged from speaking up or engaging actively in class (option a). Options b and c are actually promoted by the system, and option d is contradicted when the passage notes special needs are often ignored.

Question:
Adolescence is recognized by health organizations as the transitional phase between childhood and adulthood marked by rapid biological, psychological and social changes. While biological processes such as puberty are largely universal, the length and social meaning of this stage vary across cultures and historical periods; for instance, puberty now often begins earlier, while many societies see later age at marriage and changing sexual norms. Education, urbanization and global communication have all contributed to these shifts.

The adolescent years are also a time for gaining abilities and social roles: besides bodily maturation, young people move toward economic independence, develop a sense of identity, and learn the interpersonal and thinking skills needed for adult relationships and responsibilities. During adolescence, an adolescent __________ a range of skills and competencies necessary for adult life.

Options:
a. relinquishes
b. acquires
c. evades
d. monopolizes


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
The correct verb is "acquires" because adolescence is the period when young people obtain or gain skills and capacities required for adult roles.

Explanation:
The sentence describes adolescence as a time when individuals gain skills and competencies. "Acquires" means to obtain or gain, which fits this meaning. The other options are inappropriate: "relinquishes" means gives up, "evades" means avoids, and "monopolizes" means takes exclusive control — none convey gaining necessary skills.

Question:
After the Rosetta Stone was found in 1799 and shown to contain the same text in Greek, demotic and hieroglyphs, which scholar announced the decisive breakthrough in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs in 1822 by identifying phonetic signs in royal cartouches and comparing them with the Greek inscriptions?

Options:
a. Jean-François Champollion
b. Thomas Young
c. Napoleon Bonaparte
d. Horatio Nelson


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Jean-François Champollion announced the major breakthrough in 1822, establishing the phonetic values of many hieroglyphic signs—especially by studying names written in cartouches on the Rosetta Stone and comparing them with the known Greek text.

Explanation:
Although Thomas Young made important early contributions (noting some phonetic elements), it was Champollion who in 1822 published the decisive work identifying more phonetic signs and demonstrating that hieroglyphs could represent sounds as well as ideas. He used the Greek inscription on the Rosetta Stone and the occurrence of royal names within cartouches (such as Ptolemy) to assign sound values and unlock the script.

Question:
How did Jean-François Champollion first identify that some hieroglyphic groups were the names of kings?

Options:
a. He matched them with Greek names found on the Rosetta Stone
b. He noticed they were enclosed in an oval shape called a cartouche
c. They appeared in longer inscriptions than ordinary words
d. They were written using only picture signs, not phonetic signs


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Champollion observed that certain groups of hieroglyphs were set off inside an oval (a cartouche), and by comparing these with known Greek names he identified them as royal names.

Explanation:
Champollion used bilingual texts (like the Rosetta Stone) and knowledge of Coptic to compare inscriptions. He noticed that names of important people—especially rulers—were frequently placed inside an oval border called a cartouche. By matching cartouche contents with Greek names (for example Ptolemy), he could assign phonetic values to signs and begin deciphering hieroglyphs. The other options are incorrect: although Greek comparisons helped, the distinctive clue that marked royal names was the cartouche (not merely length or exclusive use of pictures).

Question:
A balanced environment maintains the quality of air, water, soil, flora and fauna, ensuring sustainable life on Earth. However, rapid urbanization, deforestation, improper waste disposal and unchecked industrial emissions upset this balance and lead to ecological degradation. Many of these changes are driven directly by people’s development projects, increased consumption and land-use changes. To protect biodiversity and human health, policies must target the sources of damage and promote cleaner technologies and conservation practices.

In the passage, the word 'anthropogenic' would best be interpreted as-

Options:
ক/a/ا. actions or changes produced by human beings that harm the natural environment
খ/b/ب. natural processes occurring without human intervention
গ/c/ج. long-term geological shifts in Earth’s crust
ঘ/d/ث. policies and laws created by governments


Correct Answer: ক/a/ا

Solution:
The passage links environmental degradation to human-driven factors like urbanization, deforestation and industrial emissions. 'Anthropogenic' refers to those human-caused actions or changes affecting the environment; thus option ক/a/ا is correct.

Explanation:
Anthropogenic literally means 'originating in human activity.' The context discusses harm caused by people’s projects, consumption and waste, so the term denotes human-produced impacts on nature. Options খ/b/ب and গ/c/ج describe natural or geological phenomena, and ঘ/d/ث focuses only on governance rather than the broader human activities mentioned, so they are incorrect.

Question:
After the Rosetta Stone was found, scholars used its known-language inscription to unlock ancient Egyptian writing. Which scholar is credited with finally deciphering the hieroglyphs by comparing the inscriptions and identifying names in cartouches?

Options:
a. Thomas Young
b. Jean-François Champollion
c. Napoleon Bonaparte
d. Howard Carter


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Jean-François Champollion is credited with the final breakthrough. Building on earlier work (including contributions by Thomas Young), Champollion used the Greek inscription on the Rosetta Stone and the occurrence of royal names inside cartouches to determine phonetic values of many hieroglyphic signs and published his decipherment in 1822.

Explanation:
The Rosetta Stone carried the same text in Greek, demotic and hieroglyphs; the Greek provided a known reference. Thomas Young made important initial progress by identifying some phonetic characters, but Champollion compared the texts more extensively, recognized cartouches containing royal names (like Ptolemy and Cleopatra), and established a larger set of phonetic signs, leading to full decipherment.

Question:
During Napoleon's Egyptian campaign a stone slab discovered in 1799 bore the same royal decree written in three scripts: hieroglyphic (used for religious texts), demotic (a cursive native script), and ancient Greek. Because scholars could read Greek, the Rosetta Stone became the key to unlocking hieroglyphs. Later, Jean-François Champollion compared the signs with Coptic and cartouches (oval rings around royal names) to identify phonetic characters. Thomas Young also contributed by showing that some hieroglyphs had phonetic values, but he did not complete the decipherment.

Which of the following statements is NOT true?

Options:
a. The Greek inscription on the Rosetta Stone allowed scholars to compare and begin translating the hieroglyphic text.
b. Champollion used his knowledge of Coptic and the cartouche names to establish phonetic values for many hieroglyphs.
c. Thomas Young and Champollion jointly published a complete and agreed-upon decipherment of hieroglyphs in 1805.
d. Cartouches were crucial because they often enclosed names of rulers, providing footholds for identifying phonetic signs.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Option c is NOT true. Thomas Young and Champollion did not jointly publish a complete, agreed-upon decipherment in 1805.

Explanation:
The Rosetta Stone’s Greek text did enable comparison with the hieroglyphic and demotic inscriptions (true). Champollion drew on Coptic and the identification of royal names in cartouches to deduce many phonetic values (true). Thomas Young contributed important insights into phonetic signs but stopped short of a full decipherment; Champollion published his breakthrough work later (not as a joint 1805 publication). Thus statement c is incorrect.

Question:
A good education should encourage curiosity, provide a safe and supportive atmosphere, and cater to individual needs so children can think for themselves. However, many classrooms in some regions remain rigid and authoritarian. Pupils seldom speak unless called upon, are trained to reproduce facts by rote, and are expected to obey without questioning. Teachers rarely adapt to children with learning difficulties.

According to the passage-

Options:
a. students are encouraged to challenge their teachers
b. teachers expect students to be obedient listeners
c. learning focuses mainly on developing critical thinking
d. schools universally provide special support for disabled children


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
The passage states that pupils are trained to reproduce facts by rote and are expected to obey without questioning, which means teachers expect obedient listeners.

Explanation:
The passage contrasts an ideal, supportive education with the reality in many classrooms where rigidity prevails. It explicitly says pupils seldom speak unless called upon and are expected to obey without questioning, indicating that teachers enforce obedience rather than fostering inquiry or critical thinking. This rules out the other options, which contradict the passage.

Question:
Human activities such as rapid urbanization, industrial discharge, and excessive use of fossil fuels have severely affected the quality of air, water, and soil. Untreated industrial effluents contaminate rivers and groundwater, while vehicular emissions and factory smoke increase air pollutants, causing health problems. Large-scale clearing of forests for agriculture and construction reduces biodiversity and contributes to soil erosion and climate imbalance. To address these problems, wastewater treatment, clean energy adoption, strict emission controls, and reforestation programs are recommended. Choose a suitable title for the above passage.

Options:
a. Environmental Hazards
b. Environmental Conservation
c. Urban Development Benefits
d. Industrial Expansion


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
The passage describes causes of pollution and degradation (industrial effluents, emissions, deforestation) and then recommends solutions (wastewater treatment, clean energy, emission controls, reforestation). Therefore the best title is 'Environmental Conservation'.

Explanation:
Options a, c, and d focus on problems or a single aspect: 'Environmental Hazards' emphasizes hazards but does not capture the recommended remedies; 'Urban Development Benefits' and 'Industrial Expansion' are inappropriate. The passage both identifies environmental problems and proposes measures to protect natural resources, so 'Environmental Conservation' accurately summarizes its main idea.

The onset of puberty, development of identity, and the acquisition of skills needed for adult roles most typically take place in which stage of human development?

Options:
a. childhood
b. adolescence
c. both childhood and adolescence
d. neither childhood nor adolescence


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Adolescence (b).

Explanation:
According to WHO and standard developmental theory, adolescence is the period after childhood and before adulthood marked by the onset of puberty, rapid physical growth, identity formation, increasing independence, and the development of cognitive abilities such as abstract reasoning. Childhood precedes these changes, so childhood alone (a) is incorrect; while some growth occurs in childhood, the combination of puberty, identity work and preparation for adult roles is characteristic of adolescence, so (c) and (d) are not correct.

Question:
A child's right to education implies schools should provide a warm, supportive and learning-friendly atmosphere where teachers are encouraging, harsh treatment is absent, and special arrangements are made for children with learning difficulties.

However, this ideal is often not reflected in reality. In many schools the system is authoritarian, students speak only when questioned, independent thinking is discouraged, and teaching relies heavily on memorization. Special needs are frequently neglected and children are expected to be obedient listeners rather than active learners.

The passage most strongly suggests that—

Options:
a. the education provided in many schools falls short of protecting children's right to a proper learning environment
b. teachers in these schools regularly foster students' creativity and independent thought
c. students generally have full control over how their education is shaped
d. schools have eliminated rote learning and prioritize critical thinking


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
The passage describes restrictive school systems, ignored special needs, and reliance on rote memorization, indicating that many schools do not uphold children's right to a supportive educational environment. Thus option a is correct.

Explanation:
The paragraph contrasts the ideal right to education (pleasant, supportive schools, attention to learning disabilities, freedom to think) with the reality (authoritarian systems, silence unless asked, rote memorization, ignored special needs). These facts show schools often fail to provide the environment implied by children's rights, which directly supports option a and contradicts options b, c and d.

Question:
Adolescence is a distinct phase of human development marked by rapid changes. While biological changes such as puberty play a central role, the timing, duration and social meanings of adolescence can differ widely between societies and historical periods. Which one of the following statements is NOT true?

Options:
a. The exact age at which adolescence begins and ends is the same across all cultures
b. Puberty is a biological event that signals the transition from childhood toward adolescence
c. Education, urbanization and changing social norms can alter adolescent experiences over time
d. Adolescents depend on families, schools and communities for guidance to manage risks and develop skills


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Option (a) is not true because the start and end ages of adolescence vary between cultures and over historical time.

Explanation:
Biological processes like puberty are central to adolescence, but cultural, social and economic factors influence when adolescence is considered to start and finish. Nutritional status, health care, cultural rites, legal definitions and social roles can shift the timing and characteristics of adolescence. Therefore it is incorrect to state that the exact age boundaries are identical across all societies. The other options correctly describe the biological marker (puberty), the influence of social change, and the need for support systems during adolescence.

Question:
Education is recognized as a basic right for every child, and ideally schools should be safe, encouraging places where pupils can ask questions, explore ideas and receive individual attention when needed. Unfortunately, many institutions do not live up to this ideal. In several regions the classroom atmosphere is strict and disciplined to the point that students hardly speak unless called upon. Individual learning difficulties are overlooked, and instruction often focuses on memorizing facts to pass exams rather than understanding concepts.

The passage is mainly about-

Options:
a. children's legal rights
b. the common condition of many schools
c. the issues teachers encounter
d. exam-centered rote learning


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
The passage describes the reality in many schools — strict atmosphere, lack of attention to special needs, and emphasis on memorization — so it outlines the common condition or general picture of many schools.

Explanation:
While the passage mentions children's rights and rote learning, its primary focus is to portray how many schools actually operate (strict classrooms, silence, ignored special needs). Therefore the best summary is the general condition of many schools rather than only rights, teachers' problems, or just rote memorization.

Question:
A healthy environment requires clean air, water, balanced flora and fauna, and sustainable natural resources. Human activities such as industrial discharges, vehicular emissions and large-scale deforestation contaminate these elements, upsetting ecological balance and threatening human survival. To counteract these harms, practical steps must be taken that both reduce pollutants and restore natural systems. The most practical single action to protect and improve the environment is:

Options:
a. increasing tree cover while enforcing limits on industrial pollution
b. shutting down all factories immediately
c. relying solely on natural recovery without human intervention
d. building artificial habitats for wild animals


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
The passage emphasizes both reducing industrial pollution and restoring nature (e.g., planting trees) as practical measures. Therefore the combined action of increasing tree cover and enforcing limits on pollution is the most effective single choice.

Explanation:
Option (a) addresses the two primary problems mentioned: emissions from industries and loss of trees. Planting trees helps restore oxygen supply, soil stability and habitats, while controlling industrial pollution reduces toxic gases and effluents. Options (b) and (c) are unrealistic or ineffective, and (d) treats symptoms rather than preventing pollution and deforestation, so they are inferior.

Question:
Adolescence is the transitional phase between childhood and adulthood marked by rapid physical, cognitive and psychosocial changes. While societal factors like education, urbanization and cultural norms influence how adolescence is experienced, which of the following primarily signals the biological beginning of adolescence?

Options:
a. Onset of puberty and related biological changes
b. Level of formal education attained
c. Household socio-economic status
d. Prevailing cultural attitudes toward marriage


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
The onset of puberty and accompanying biological changes (hormonal, physical sexual maturation) primarily mark the biological start of adolescence.

Explanation:
Adolescence is defined biologically by puberty—the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis leading to secondary sexual characteristics and reproductive maturation. Although education, socio-economic conditions and cultural norms shape the duration, opportunities and behaviours during adolescence, they do not constitute the primary biological marker that initiates the adolescent period. Therefore the correct answer is the onset of puberty and related biological changes.

Question:
In many classrooms today, students are encouraged to memorize facts and recite answers to exams rather than explore ideas. The emphasis is on repetition, strict discipline, and producing the 'right' answer, which leaves little room for curiosity or problem-solving. Such an approach values recall over understanding.

In this context, the word 'rote' most nearly means-

Options:
a. learning by mechanical repetition without real understanding
b. acquiring knowledge through critical discussion
c. gradual forgetting of unimportant details
d. applying lessons to practical situations


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Rote refers to memorizing or learning something by repeated practice or repetition, often without understanding the underlying meaning.

Explanation:
Option (a) correctly captures the idea of mechanical repetition without comprehension, which is the definition of 'rote.' Option (b) describes critical, discussion-based learning (opposite of rote). Option (c) refers to forgetting, not memorizing. Option (d) describes applied learning, which requires understanding and is not rote.

Question:
During Napoleon's Egyptian expedition the Rosetta Stone was uncovered in 1799. The inscriptions included hieroglyphics that modern scholars date to about 3300 B.C. Using these dates, how many years passed between the time those earliest hieroglyphics were created and the stone's discovery?

Options:
a. 5099
b. 1499
c. 5100
d. 3301


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Add the absolute value of the BC date to the discovery year: [math]3300 + 1799 = 5099[/math] years.

Explanation:
A date given as 3300 B.C. is 3300 years before year 1 A.D., so the interval from 3300 B.C. to 1799 A.D. equals 3300 + 1799 years. Therefore the elapsed time between the earliest hieroglyphics (c. 3300 B.C.) and the stone's discovery in 1799 is [math]5099[/math] years.

Question:
According to WHO, adolescence is the period between childhood and adulthood marked by rapid physical, sexual and psychosocial development. While biological changes like puberty are fairly universal, the exact timing and length of adolescence vary across cultures, times and socio-economic settings. Over the past century puberty has tended to occur earlier, marriage is often later, and social attitudes and behaviours around sexuality have changed. Adolescence involves growth in abstract reasoning, identity formation, and movement toward social and economic independence, but adolescents continue to rely on families, schools, health services and communities to learn skills and cope with risks. 

Which of the following is NOT a message given in the passage?

Options:
ক/a/ا. Adolescence involves rapid biological and psychosocial change that is important in the transition to adulthood.
খ/b/ب. Adolescents typically achieve full economic independence and no longer rely on family or institutions during this period.
গ/c/ج. The onset of puberty marks the biological transition from childhood to adolescence, but social factors shape its duration and features.
ঘ/d/ث. Adolescents need support from families, schools and communities to acquire skills and manage the risks of this period.


Correct Answer: খ/b/ب

Solution:
The passage states that adolescence is a time of movement toward independence but also emphasizes that adolescents continue to depend on families, schools and communities to learn skills and cope with risks, so the claim that they achieve full economic independence is not presented.

Explanation:
Options ক/a/ا, গ/c/ج and ঘ/d/ث are supported by the passage: it describes rapid biological and psychosocial change (ক/a/ا), notes puberty as a biological marker while social factors influence the period (গ/c/ج), and stresses adolescents' reliance on social supports to gain skills and manage risks (ঘ/d/ث). Option খ/b/ب contradicts the passage by asserting full economic independence, which the text does not claim; instead it mentions only a movement toward independence while still relying on external supports.

Question:
A balanced environment depends on clean air, freshwater, fertile soil, vegetation, and wildlife. Yet, rapid industrial growth, urban sprawl, and intensive farming have introduced pollutants and altered natural habitats. Factories release toxic emissions and untreated wastes into rivers and the atmosphere; forests are cleared for timber and agriculture, reducing carbon sinks and displacing species. Many environmental problems—rising temperatures, ocean acidification, and biodiversity loss—are largely the result of activities initiated by humans. To protect ecosystems, governments and industries must control these sources and adopt sustainable practices.

In the passage, the term 'anthropogenic' would most nearly mean-

Options:
a. natural environmental cycles beyond human influence
b. random events caused by geological processes
c. processes or changes caused directly by human activities
d. technological advances that always benefit nature


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
The passage describes environmental changes resulting from human actions like industrial emissions, deforestation, and urbanization. 'Anthropogenic' refers to causes originating with humans, so option c is correct.

Explanation:
Anthropogenic literally means 'originating in human activity.' The passage links pollution, habitat loss, and climate impacts to human-driven activities (factories, farming, deforestation). Options a and b describe natural causes (not human), and option d incorrectly claims these advances always benefit nature, which contradicts the passage.

Question:
Education is recognized as a basic right, but in practice many schools fail to provide a nurturing environment. In several institutions teachers focus mainly on preparing pupils for exams, enforce strict discipline, and discourage questions or creative activities. Children with special needs often receive little support, and classrooms emphasize memorizing facts rather than understanding ideas. As a result, students rarely learn to analyze or express their own views.

The passage is primarily about-

Options:
a. the universal recognition of the right to education
b. the lack of student-centered and inclusive practices in many schools
c. the advantages of strict discipline in classrooms
d. how teachers are trained for special needs education


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
The passage describes problems found in many schools—exam-focused teaching, strict discipline, neglect of special needs, and reliance on memorization—which together indicate a lack of student-centered and inclusive practices.

Explanation:
Option b matches the overall theme: the passage criticizes prevailing school practices that ignore students' individual needs and discourage critical thinking. Option a is only a background statement, not the main focus. Option c is incorrect because the passage presents strict discipline negatively, not as an advantage. Option d is too specific and not supported; the passage says teachers often fail to support special needs, but it does not discuss training programs.

Question:
The Rosetta Stone was discovered by French soldiers in 1799 and later enabled the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Jean-François Champollion published his major breakthrough in 1822. How many years passed between the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and Champollion's decipherment?

Options:
a. 13 years
b. 23 years
c. 33 years
d. 43 years


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
1822 − 1799 = 23 years elapsed between the discovery and Champollion's decipherment.

Explanation:
The Rosetta Stone was found in 1799. Champollion announced his decipherment in 1822. Subtracting the years gives 1822 − 1799 = 23, so 23 years passed between discovery and the breakthrough.

Question:
The Rosetta Stone bore the same decree in three scripts. Which language on the stone — already understood by scholars at the time — provided the crucial translation that allowed early researchers to identify royal names in the hieroglyphic cartouches?

Options:
a. Greek
b. Demotic
c. Coptic
d. Hieroglyphics


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Greek. Scholars could read the Greek inscription, and by comparing Greek names of rulers (like Ptolemy) with names enclosed in hieroglyphic cartouches, they began to deduce phonetic values for the hieroglyphic signs.

Explanation:
The Rosetta Stone contained the same text in hieroglyphics, demotic, and Greek. Because Greek was a known language, early Egyptologists used the Greek text as a key to identify proper names and phrases. By matching the Greek names of rulers to the sequences of signs inside the oval cartouches in the hieroglyphic portion, researchers (notably Thomas Young and later Champollion) were able to assign phonetic values to some hieroglyphs and make the crucial breakthroughs that led to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics. Demotic was an intermediate script and Coptic is a later stage of Egyptian language, but neither provided the immediate readable translation that Greek did.

Which of the following statements is NOT true regarding the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and the early decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs?

Options:
a. The Rosetta Stone contained the same decree written in hieroglyphics, demotic, and Greek, which allowed scholars to compare scripts.
b. Champollion used cartouches—ovals enclosing royal names—to help identify phonetic signs and eventually read many names and words.
c. Thomas Young demonstrated that every Egyptian hieroglyph corresponded directly to single letters identical to the Greek alphabet.
d. Napoleon's expedition to Egypt and the scholars accompanying it stimulated European interest in studying ancient Egyptian language and monuments.


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Option c is not true.

Explanation:
Thomas Young did show that some hieroglyphs, especially in foreign names, had phonetic values, but he did not claim that every hieroglyph corresponded directly to single letters identical to the Greek alphabet. Champollion later established a more complex system showing hieroglyphs could be phonetic, ideographic, or determinative, rather than a simple one-to-one match with Greek letters.

Thomas Young proposed that certain hieroglyphic signs had phonetic values.

Explanation:
The English polymath Thomas Young studied the Rosetta Stone and argued that some hieroglyphs represented sounds (phonetic signs), especially within cartouches containing royal names. This insight complemented Champollion's later, more complete decipherment; Champollion used Young's work and additional evidence (including Coptic) to establish a fuller phonetic alphabet for Egyptian hieroglyphs.

Question:
Natural resources such as forests, rivers, soil and wildlife provide food, water, oxygen and shelter that sustain life. Yet rapid urban growth, unchecked logging, industrial discharge and heavy reliance on fossil fuels are depleting these assets and damaging ecosystems. Soil becomes infertile through erosion and contamination, water bodies receive toxic wastes, and many species lose their natural homes. Implementing sustainable measures like reforestation, wastewater treatment, water-saving techniques, use of renewable energy and strict environmental laws is essential. Public awareness and responsible consumption also help protect these resources for future generations.

Choose a suitable title for the above passage?

Options:
a. Environmental Pollution
b. Impact of Urbanization
c. Conserving Natural Resources
d. Wildlife Habitats


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
The passage focuses on depletion and degradation of forests, water, soil and wildlife due to human activities and emphasizes sustainable practices (reforestation, wastewater treatment, conservation, renewables, laws, awareness) to protect these assets. Therefore the most appropriate title is 'Conserving Natural Resources'.

Explanation:
'Environmental Pollution' (a) and 'Impact of Urbanization' (b) address parts of the passage but are too narrow, since the passage discusses both causes and solutions for resource depletion. 'Wildlife Habitats' (d) is related but only addresses one aspect. 'Conserving Natural Resources' (c) best captures the overall theme of protecting forests, water, soil and biodiversity through sustainable actions.

Question:
Which feature of the Rosetta Stone most directly enabled scholars to decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics?

Options:
a. It contained an illustrated history of Egyptian kings
b. It preserved the same decree written in three scripts, including known Greek
c. It listed the pronunciation of hieroglyphic signs in Latin letters
d. It was discovered by Jean-François Champollion himself


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
The Rosetta Stone carried the same text in three scripts — hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek — allowing scholars to compare the unknown scripts with the known Greek text.

Explanation:
The Rosetta Stone's crucial value lay in its trilingual inscription. Because one of the three versions was written in ancient Greek, a language scholars could read, they could use it as a key to identify names and phrases in the hieroglyphic and demotic texts. This comparative method allowed researchers like Thomas Young and especially Jean-François Champollion to determine phonetic values and meanings of signs, eventually leading to the decipherment of hieroglyphs. The other options are incorrect: the stone did not provide a Latin pronunciation (c), Champollion did not discover the stone (d), and it was not merely an illustrated list of kings (a).

Question:
Adolescence is the phase between childhood and adulthood characterized by rapid biological, psychological and social changes. Although biological processes such as puberty initiate many of the physical changes, the timing, duration and experiences of adolescence are shaped by cultural, economic and environmental factors. Over the past century, factors like improved nutrition, urbanization, wider access to education and global media have altered the age of puberty, patterns of leaving the parental home, marriage timing and sexual attitudes. This period also involves cognitive development, formation of identity, increasing independence and acquisition of skills needed for adult roles. Families, schools, health services and communities therefore influence adolescents' ability to cope with risks and make a successful transition to adulthood.

Which one of the following statements is not true?

Options:
a. Puberty marks the biological beginning of adolescence.
b. Adolescence is determined solely by biological factors and does not vary with culture or environment.
c. Social institutions like families and schools help adolescents develop skills for adult roles.
d. Changes in nutrition, education and urban living have contributed to shifts in adolescent experiences over time.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Option b is incorrect because adolescence is influenced by a combination of biological, psychological and social factors; its timing and characteristics vary across cultures, socio-economic contexts and historical periods.

Explanation:
The passage states that biological processes drive many aspects of adolescent growth but that the duration and defining characteristics vary across time, cultures and socio-economic situations. Factors such as education, urbanization and global communication have changed adolescent experiences (e.g., earlier puberty, later marriage). Therefore adolescence is not solely biologically determined; social and environmental factors play major roles, making option b untrue.

The Rosetta Stone contained the same decree in three scripts, which allowed scholars to unlock ancient Egyptian writing. Which of the following scripts on the Rosetta Stone was the formal pictorial system used mainly for religious texts and inscriptions on monuments?

Options:
a. Demotic
b. Hieroglyphics
c. Greek
d. French


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Hieroglyphics were the formal pictorial script used on temples and monuments; demotic was the cursive/ordinary Egyptian script, Greek was the Hellenistic administrative language on the stone, and French was not written on the Rosetta Stone.

Explanation:
The Rosetta Stone presents the same decree in three forms: hieroglyphics (the formal, pictorial script used for religious and monumental inscriptions), demotic (the everyday Egyptian cursive script), and Ancient Greek (the language of administration under the Ptolemies). French never appeared on the stone. Because hieroglyphics were used for sacred and monumental contexts, option b is correct.

c. Legal age of marriage
d. Completion of higher education


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Onset of puberty is the biological event that marks the passage from childhood to adolescence.

Explanation:
Biological processes drive much of the growth that defines adolescence. The onset of puberty—characterized by hormonal changes and the development of secondary sexual characteristics—is widely recognized (including by WHO) as the biological marker signaling the transition from childhood to adolescence. Social milestones like starting school, marriage laws, or finishing education vary across cultures and are not biological markers.

Adolescence is a developmental phase characterized by rapid physical growth and psychosocial changes. Although social, economic and cultural conditions shape how adolescence is experienced, which of the following primarily initiates the biological transition from childhood to adolescence?

Options:
a. Hormonal changes associated with puberty
b. Level of formal education achieved
c. Degree of urbanization in one's environment
d. Household socio-economic status


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Hormonal changes associated with puberty are the primary biological trigger marking the start of adolescence.

Explanation:
The onset of adolescence is biologically driven by endocrine changes — activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis leads to increased sex hormones and the physical signs of puberty. While education, urbanization and socio-economic status influence the timing, duration and social experience of adolescence (for example through nutrition or stress), they do not themselves constitute the core biological mechanism that initiates the transition.

Question:
Rapid urban growth and expanding industries have led to increased air and water pollution. Factories discharge poisonous effluents, and large-scale tree felling for timber and fuel reduces oxygen supply and destroys habitats of animals and birds. Such activities upset the ecological balance and threaten human survival. To protect the environment in the simplest and most effective way, we should:

Options:
ক/a/ا. promote large-scale tree planting and reduce factory emissions
খ/b/ب. completely halt industrialization
গ/c/ج. only enact stricter environmental laws
ঘ/d/ث. focus solely on building shelters for displaced wildlife


Correct Answer: ক/a/ا

Solution:
The passage emphasizes that planting more trees and curbing industrial pollutants are straightforward measures to restore oxygen supply, preserve habitats, and lower toxic emissions; therefore promoting afforestation and reducing factory emissions is the simplest effective action.

Explanation:
Industries release toxic gases and effluents while deforestation cuts oxygen supply and destroys animal shelters, both disrupting ecological balance. While laws, halting industry, or building shelters may help, the immediate, practical approach described in the passage is increasing tree cover and controlling industrial emissions—this directly addresses both oxygen loss and pollution sources.

Question:
Today children's entitlement to education is widely accepted, which also means schools should provide a welcoming, supportive atmosphere where all pupils learn without fear. Teachers should be encouraging and attentive to individual needs, especially for those with learning difficulties.

However, in many places the reality is different. Classrooms are dominated by strict rules, harsh criticism, and a focus on memorizing facts. Students rarely express opinions, take initiative in learning, or receive accommodations for special needs. The system values obedience over inquiry.

The passage most strongly indicates that-

Options:
a. many schools do not offer the supportive, inclusive learning environment that children's right to education requires
b. current education policies successfully promote student-centered learning and critical inquiry
c. teachers generally adapt lessons to suit the needs of students with learning disabilities
d. memorization-based instruction helps students become independent thinkers


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
The passage contrasts the ideal (supportive, inclusive schools that respect children's rights) with the reality (strict, memorization-focused classrooms that ignore special needs). Option a directly summarizes this contrast.

Explanation:
The paragraph describes how schools are often harsh, suppress student participation, focus on rote learning, and neglect learners with disabilities. Options b, c, and d contradict these descriptions, so the best choice is a, which states that many schools fail to provide the required supportive and inclusive environment.

Question:
Education is accepted today as a basic right, which implies schools should be welcoming places where children feel safe, encouraged and able to learn. Ideally teachers would support curiosity, use kind words and pay attention to children who struggle.

But in many places this is not the reality. The prevailing school system is rigid and does not allow pupils much independence. Children remain quiet in class unless the teacher calls on them. Learning is dominated by rote memorization, and students are trained to obey rather than to question or think independently.

According to the passage-

Options:
a. students freely challenge their teachers
b. teachers value obedience and rote learning over questioning
c. schools always give special help to weak students
d. children control the pace and content of their education


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
The passage states that students stay silent unless asked, learning is based on rote memorization, and students are encouraged to be obedient listeners, which shows teachers value obedience and rote learning over questioning.

Explanation:
Key lines in the passage describe a rigid system where 'children remain quiet in class unless the teacher calls on them' and 'learning is dominated by rote memorization.' These details indicate that questioning and independent thinking are discouraged and obedience is emphasized, making option (b) the correct interpretation.
