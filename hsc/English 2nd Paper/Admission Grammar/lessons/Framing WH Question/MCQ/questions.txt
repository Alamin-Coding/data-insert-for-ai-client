Question:
Which of the students ----- top marks in the exam?

Options:
ক. you said
খ. did you say
গ. did you say that
ঘ. you did say


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Fill the blank with 'did you say' to form: 'Which of the students did you say got top marks in the exam?'

Explanation:
This is an embedded wh-question. The correct structure is 'Which ... did you say ...' — the auxiliary 'did' is required for the reported question. 'Did you say that' would produce 'Which of the students did you say that got ...', which is ungrammatical with the fronted wh-phrase. 'You said' and 'you did say' do not create the necessary interrogative embedding.

Question:
Who ----- been appointed as the new manager?

Options:
ক. you said
খ. did you say
গ. did you say that
ঘ. you did say


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Use 'did you say' to make: 'Who did you say had been appointed as the new manager?'

Explanation:
When reporting a wh-question about a subject (Who ...), English uses 'Who did you say ...' followed by the clause. Inserting 'that' ('did you say that') before the subject creates an ungrammatical sequence ('Who did you say that had been...'). Simple statements ('you said' / 'you did say') don't form the embedded question structure needed here.

Options:

ঘ. you did say


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
The correct completion is 'did you say': 'Who did you say was responsible for organizing the event?'

Explanation:
This is an embedded wh-question requiring the auxiliary 'did' to introduce the reported clause. 'Did you say that' would incorrectly insert 'that' before the wh-subject ('Who did you say that was...'), which is not acceptable. The plain past forms 'you said' or 'you did say' do not create the embedded question structure.

Options:
ক. বইটি কে ধার করেছে?
খ. রাম বইটি কবে ধার নিয়েছে?
গ. রাম বইটি কোথা থেকে ধার নিয়েছে?
ঘ. রাম বইটি কেন ধার নিয়েছে?


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
রাম বইটি কোথা থেকে ধার নিয়েছে? কারণ বাক্যে ধার নেয়ার স্থান (লাইব্রেরি) উল্লেখ আছে, তাই স্থান জানতে ‘কোথা থেকে’ ব্যবহার করতে হবে।

Explanation:
WH প্রশ্ন বানাতে বাক্যে যেটি জানতে চাওয়া হবে তার উপর নির্ভর করে উপযুক্ত প্রশ্নবোধক শব্দ বেছে নিতে হয়। ব্যক্তি জানার জন্য 'কে/কাকে', সময় জানার জন্য 'কবে/কখন', স্থান জানার জন্য 'কোথায়/কোথা থেকে', কারণ জানতে 'কেন' ইত্যাদি ব্যবহার করা হয়। এখানে লাইব্রেরি—এটি স্থান, তাই 'কোথা থেকে' সঠিক।

খ. মমতাজ নতুন চাকরি কোথায় শুরু করবেন?
গ. মমতাজ কখন নতুন চাকরি শুরু করবেন?
ঘ. মমতাজ কেন নতুন চাকরি নেবেন?


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
মমতাজ কখন নতুন চাকরি শুরু করবেন? কারণ বাক্যে ‘আগামী মাসে’—যা সময় নির্দেশ করে—অতএব সময় জানতে 'কখন/কবে' প্রশ্নবোধক ব্যবহার করতে হবে।

Explanation:
কোনো ক әрек্যের সময় জানতে বাংলা প্রশ্নে সাধারণত 'কখন' বা 'কবে' ব্যবহার করা হয়। বাক্যে স্পষ্টত একটি সময় পরিভাষা ('আগামী মাসে') আছে, তাই সঠিক WH প্রশ্ন হল সময় সম্পর্কে: 'মমতাজ কখন নতুন চাকরি শুরু করবেন?'

Options:
ক. গতকাল কে বিনামূল্যে চিকিৎসা পেয়েছেন?
খ. ডা. হাসান কেন বিনামূল্যে চিকিৎসা দিয়েছেন?
গ. ডা. হাসান কোথায় চিকিৎসা দিয়েছেন?
ঘ. ডা. হাসান কখন চিকিৎসা দিয়েছেন?


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
গতকাল কে বিনামূল্যে চিকিৎসা পেয়েছেন? কারণ বাক্যে কার জন্য/কার প্রতি চিকিৎসা হয়েছে—অর্থাৎ রোগী (অনাহিতা)—সেজন্য গ্রাহক/প্রাপকের পরিচয় জানতে 'কে' ব্যবহার করা উচিত।

Explanation:
যখন বাক্যে কেউ কাউকে কিছু করেছে, তখন প্রাপক বা যাকে ক্রিয়া প্রযোজ্য হয়েছে তাকে জানতে 'কে/কাকে/কাদের' ব্যবহার করা হয়। এখানে অনাহিতা হচ্ছেন চিকিৎসার প্রাপক, তাই সঠিক WH প্রশ্ন হলো 'কে বিনামূল্যে চিকিৎসা পেয়েছেন?' (অথবা বাক্যবিন্যাস রেখে 'ডা. হাসান গতকাল কাকে বিনামূল্যে চিকিৎসা দিয়েছেন?')

Question:
How ----------------- living here?

Options:
ক. long have you been
খ. how long you have been
গ. long are you living
ঘ. many months have you been


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
কথ্যটি কোনো স্থানে কতক্ষণ সময় ধরে থাকার ব্যাপার জিজ্ঞেস করছে, তাই WH-word হবে "how long" এবং টেন্স হিসেবে present perfect continuous ব্যবহার করলে বাক্য হবে "have you been living"। ফলে সঠিক অংশ হবে "long have you been"।

Explanation:
Duration জানতে 'how long' ব্যবহার করি। পূর্ণ বাক্য: "How long have you been living here?"। অপশন খ-এর ক্রম (how long you have been) প্রশ্নবোধক বিন্যাস না থাকা; গ-ও ওখানে auxiliary ভুল (are) এবং ঘ-তে মাত্রাগুলো লিখলেও বাক্যগতভাবে অনুপযুক্তভাবে বিন্যস্ত।

Question:

Options:

খ. long have you been working
গ. long you have worked
ঘ. many years do you work


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
কোম্পানিতে কাজ করার সময়কাল জিজ্ঞেস করতে 'how long' ও present perfect continuous (have you been working) ব্যবহার করা উপযুক্ত। তাই সঠিক অংশটি "long have you been working"।

Explanation:
সময়কাল বা অব্যাহত কাজ বোঝাতে সাধারণত "How long have you been working at this company?" বলি। অপশন ক-তে শব্দচার ভুল ('much time' ব্যবহার করলে বাক্যটি অস্বাভাবিক এবং ক্রমিক সাজায় সমস্যা), গ-তে auxiliary ও word order ভুল, ঘ-তে সাধারণ present simple দিয়ে প্রশ্নটি অপ্রাসঙ্গিক এবং 'many years do you work' ব্যাকরণগতভাবে সঠিক নয়।

Question:

Options:
ক. much does this cost
খ. many does this cost
গ. much is this costing
ঘ. how much is this


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
দামের জন্য 'how much' ব্যবহার করা হয় এবং present simple প্রশ্নে ক্রিয়া 'cost' হওয়ায় সাহায্যকারী 'does' পূর্বে আসে: "How much does this cost?" তাই সঠিক অংশ "much does this cost"।

Explanation:
'How much' অনির্দিষ্ট পরিমাণ বা মূল্য জিজ্ঞেস করতে ব্যবহৃত হয়। ফুল প্রশ্ন: "How much does this pen cost?" অপশন খ-তে 'many' ব্যবহার ভুল (গণনাযোগ্যদের জন্য), গ-তে continuous ফর্ম ('is this costing') অস্বাভাবিক এবং ঘ-তে দেওয়া অংশ বাক্যটিতে প্লেস করলে পুনরাবৃত্তি হবে (How how much...), ফলে ক একমাত্র সঠিক।

ক. does the meeting start?
খ. do the meeting start?
গ. is the meeting starts?
ঘ. does meeting starts?


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Use the auxiliary 'does' for a singular third-person subject ('the meeting') and the base verb form 'start'. The correct word order for a Wh-question is: When + auxiliary + subject + base verb → When + does + the meeting + start?

Explanation:
'The meeting' is a singular noun (third person), so we use 'does' as the auxiliary. After 'does' the main verb takes its base form ('start', not 'starts'). Options খ and ঘ have wrong auxiliary or missing article; গ uses the auxiliary incorrectly and the verb is not in base form.

Question:
How often --------------- your brother visit you?

Options:
ক. do your brother visit you?
খ. does your brother visits you?
গ. does your brother visit you?
ঘ. is your brother visiting you?


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
For frequency questions with a third-person singular subject ('your brother'), use 'does' + subject + base verb. So: How often + does + your brother + visit + you?

Explanation:
Option গ correctly uses 'does' (appropriate for third-person singular) and the base verb 'visit'. Option ক uses 'do' which doesn't agree with the singular subject; খ incorrectly keeps 'visits' after 'does'; ঘ uses present continuous which changes meaning (ongoing action) and doesn't match the general-frequency sense of 'how often'.

Why --------------- she complain about everything?

Options:

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Form a Wh-question with third-person singular 'she': Why + does + she + complain + about everything? Use 'does' and the base verb 'complain'.

Explanation:
Option গ has correct auxiliary-subject inversion and the base verb form. Option ক uses 'do' (wrong agreement), খ mixes 'is' with the third-person '-s' verb (incorrect structure), and ঘ fails to invert subject and auxiliary, so it's not a proper question form.

Question:
নিম্নলিখিত প্রশ্নের সঠিক গ্রাম্যাটিক্যাল উত্তর কোনটি হবে - Have you ever flown abroad?

Options:
ক. Yes, I flew.
খ. Yes, I have.
গ. Yes, I had.
ঘ. Yes, I do.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Present perfect প্রশ্নে (Have you ever ... ?) সাহায্যকারী ক্রিয়া 'have' ব্যবহার করা হয়। সংক্ষিপ্ত জবাবের কাঠামো: Yes + subject + helping verb → Yes, I have.

Explanation:
প্রশ্নে 'Have you ever' দেখে বোঝা যায় ক্রিয়ার সম্পন্নতার উপর জিজ্ঞাসা করা হচ্ছে, তাই 'I have' ব্যবহার করে সংক্ষিপ্ত সঠিক উত্তর দেয়া হবে। 'I flew' বা 'I had' ভুল কারণ ওগুলো সরাসরি past simple বা past perfect ইঙ্গিত করে, এবং সংক্ষিপ্ত জবাবে সাহায্যকারী ক্রিয়া ব্যবহার করা প্রয়োজন।

Explanation:
প্রশ্ন 'Has she finished...?' হওয়ায় সঠিক সংক্ষিপ্ত উত্তর হবে 'Yes, she has.' 'Yes, she finished' ভুল কারণ তা past simple প্রকাশ করে এবং সংক্ষিপ্ত জবাবে সাহায্যকারী ক্রিয়া প্রয়োজন। 'She do' ও 'she had' সঙ্গত নয় এই প্রশ্নের সাথে।

তারা চায় ------- আগামীকাল সভায় উপস্থিত থাকতে।

Options:
ক. we attend
খ. us to attend
গ. that we attend
ঘ. we will attend


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Want + object + to + verb কাঠামো অনুসারে সঠিক বিকল্প হলো "us to attend"। পূর্ণ বাক্য: "They want us to attend the meeting tomorrow."

Explanation:
ক্রিয়াপদ 'want' পর সাধারণত একটি বস্তু (object) ও তারপর 'to' + মূলক্রিয়া আসে। এখানে 'they' হলো ক্রিয়াতার, 'us' হলো বস্তু (object) এবং 'to attend' হলো infinitive। অন্যান্য অপশনগুলো ভুল কারণ (ক) সরাসরি 'we attend' ব্যবহার করলে grammar সঠিক নয়, (গ) 'that we attend' ব্যবহৃত হলে তা আরও formal বা subordinate clause হয় এবং এখানে 'want' এর পর এই কাঠামো প্রযোজ্য নয়, (ঘ) 'we will attend' ভবিষ্যতকাল নির্দেশ করে কিন্তু কাঠামোর সাথে মিল নেই।

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Want + object + to + verb ফর্মে সঠিক উত্তর হলো "students to finish"। সম্পূর্ণ বাক্য: "The teacher wants students to finish all the questions before the exam starts."

Explanation:
এখানে 'wants' এর পরে বস্তু ('students') এবং infinitive ('to finish') থাকা আবশ্যক। (ক) সরাসরি 'the students finish' ব্যবহারে grammar সঠিক নয়, (গ) 'that students finish' subordinate clause সৃষ্টি করে এবং সাধারণ 'want' কাঠামোর সাথে মিলছে না, (ঘ) 'students finished' past participle/adjunct নয় এবং কাঠামোর সাথে খাপ খায় না।

Question:

Options:

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
প্রশ্নে 'How often' বা 반복 ঘটনার কথা বলছে; তাই present perfect (have/has + past participle) ব্যবহার করা উচিত: 'have I told you'. প্রশ্নবোধক সর্বাধিকার অনুসারে auxiliary + subject + past participle হয়।

Explanation:
‘How often’ দিয়ে বারবার হওয়া কাজ বোঝানো হলে সাধারণত present perfect ব্যবহার করা হয় কারণ অতীত থেকে বর্তমান পর্যন্ত বারবার হয়ে আসার দিকে ইঙ্গিত করে। প্রশ্ন রূপে auxiliary (have) আগে আসে, তাই সঠিক বাক্য হবে 'How often have I told you about the meeting?'।

Explanation:
Duration বা সময়কাল জানতে চাইলে structure: 'How long + has/have + subject + been + since ...' ব্যবহার হয়। ‘You left the office’ এখানে ঘটনার শুরু; তাই সঠিক প্রশ্ন হবে 'How long has it been since you left the office?' ซึ่ง اختيار ক ('has it been') সঠিক।

Options:

খ. do/leaves

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
What time does the last train leave?

Explanation:
Timetabled events (trains, buses, flights) normally use the simple present. The subject 'the last train' is third person singular, so we use the auxiliary 'does' plus the base form of the verb 'leave'. Other options are ungrammatical: 'do/leaves' mixes plural auxiliary with singular verb form; 'will/leave' uses future but the simple present is preferred for schedules; 'is/leaving' (present continuous) could imply a planned arrangement but is not the standard form for timetables.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
When does the workshop start?

Explanation:
For scheduled events we use the simple present. 'Workshop' is third person singular, so the correct auxiliary is 'does' followed by the base verb 'start'. 'Will/start' is future tense (less appropriate for published schedules), 'is/starts' is ungrammatical (mixing 'is' with an -s form), and 'do/start' uses the wrong auxiliary for third person singular.

Options:

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
What time do we leave for the trip?

Explanation:
When asking about a scheduled departure, the simple present is used with the appropriate auxiliary for the subject. Here the subject is 'we', so we use 'do' + base verb 'leave'. 'Will/leave' is grammatically correct but refers to future prediction rather than a schedule; 'does/leaves' is wrong because 'does' doesn't agree with 'we'; 'are/leaving' (present continuous) could be used if describing a planned arrangement, but the target form for timetabled/scheduled questions is the simple present 'do/leave'.

Explanation:
‘How long’ দিয়ে ভবিষ্যৎকাল বা নির্ধারিত প্রত্যাশিত সময় জানতে হলে সহায়ক ক্রিয়া 'will' লাগে এবং মূল ক্রিয়া বেস ফর্মে থাকে। অপশন ক ও গ-তে 'does' ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে যা এখানে অপ্রযোজ্য, এবং অপশন ঘ-তে 'takes' ভুল ফর্ম।

Question:
Please tell me why ------ the meeting yesterday.

Options:

খ. didn't he come

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
embedded (indirect) question–এর ক্ষেত্রে সরাসরি প্রশ্নের মতো inversion হয় না; তাই subject + verb (negative হিসেবে did not/didn't + base verb) ব্যবহার হবে: 'he didn't come'।

Explanation:
"Please tell me why" একটি indirect question clause শুরু করে, তাই আমাদেরকে statement-আদেশিত word order ব্যবহার করতে হবে: subject + verb। "didn't he come" বা "did he not come" হল direct question forms এবং "he didn't came" ভুল কারণ past tense এ already 'did' থাকলে verb-এর base form থাকতে হবে।

Solution:
Indirect question-এ subject + verb ব্যবহৃত হবে: 'she resigned from the company last year'। এছাড়া 'resign' ক্রিয়ার সঙ্গে কোম্পানির ক্ষেত্রে preposition 'from' লাগে।

Explanation:
"Can you explain why" পরের clause-টি indirect হওয়ায় প্রশ্ন inversion (Did she resign...) ব্যবহার করা ঠিক নয়। 'resigned she from' অসামঞ্জস্যপূর্ণ word order এবং 'she didn't resign from' অর্থত ভিন্ন (তিনি ছাড়েননি)। তাই সঠিক পূরণ: 'she resigned from'।

Choose the correct question tag to complete the sentence: "You have finished your homework, _____?"

Options:
ক. Aren't you?
খ. Haven't you?
গ. Didn't you?
ঘ. Don't you?


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
খ. Haven't you?
The main clause uses the auxiliary verb 'have' (present perfect). For a positive statement we use a negative tag with the same auxiliary and the pronoun 'you' → haven't you?

Explanation:
Rule: When the main clause is positive and contains an auxiliary verb (here 'have'), the tag is negative and repeats that auxiliary with the subject pronoun. 'You have finished' → tag: 'haven't you?'. Other options use incorrect auxiliaries or wrong polarity.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
খ. Can they?
The main clause is negative ('can't'), so the tag must be positive and use the same modal verb 'can' with the subject 'they' → can they?

Explanation:
Rule: A negative statement takes a positive tag using the same auxiliary/modal. Since 'can't' is negative, the tag is 'can they?'. 'Can't they?' would double the negation; 'Don't they?' and 'Couldn't they?' use wrong auxiliaries/forms.

Options:

খ. Didn't she?
গ. Didn't they?
ঘ. Did they?


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
গ. Didn't they?
The sentence is positive in the past tense ('enjoyed'), so the tag is negative with the auxiliary 'did' and a subject pronoun. For indefinite pronouns like 'everyone' we commonly use the singular 'didn't he/she?', but modern English prefers the gender-neutral plural tag 'didn't they?'.

Explanation:
Rule: Positive past-tense statements use a negative tag with 'didn't' plus an appropriate pronoun. 'Everyone' is formally singular, but in everyday and standard usage the gender-neutral tag 'didn't they?' is preferred. 'Did they?' is positive and therefore incorrect.

২) বাক্যটি past simple তাই WH + did + subject + base verb ব্যবহার করতে হবে: When + did + Rohit + leave + the meeting?
৩) সঠিক প্রশ্ন: "When did Rohit leave the meeting?"

Explanation:
সঠিক WH শব্দ হচ্ছে 'When' কারণ বাক্যে সময় জানানো হয়েছে। ইংরেজিতে past simple প্রশ্নে সহায়ক ক্রিয়া 'did' লাগবে এবং মূল ক্রিয়ার base form (leave) ব্যবহার হবে। বিকল্প ক তে সহায়ক ক্রিয়া নেই (অশুদ্ধ প্রশ্ন গঠন), গ তে শব্দের বিন্যাস অশুদ্ধ ও auxiliary নেই, ঘ তে 'why' ভুল WH শব্দ এবং 'leaving' ভুল verb form।

Question:
নিচের বাক্যের জন্য সঠিক WH প্রশ্নটি নির্বাচন করুন: "She was born in 1990."

Options:
ক. When was she born?
খ. Where was she born 1990?
গ. What was she born?
ঘ. When did she born?


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
১) জানতে চাওয়া বিষয় — জন্মের সময় (When).
২) বাক্যটি passive past tense (was born), তাই WH + was + subject + born ব্যবহার হবে: When + was + she + born?
৩) সঠিক প্রশ্ন: "When was she born?"

Explanation:
এই বাক্য passive voice-এ আছে ('was born'), তাই প্রশ্ন গঠনে 'was' অপরিহার্য। ক-ই সঠিক কারণ এটি সঠিক WH শব্দ (When) ও উপযুক্ত auxiliary ব্যবহার করেছে। খ তে শব্দক্রম ও প্রিপোজিশন ভুল, গ অনর্থক (born কী—এ ধরনের প্রশ্ন অপ্রাসঙ্গিক), ঘ-তে 'did' ব্যবহার করে ভুল verb form হয়েছে ('born' passive, 'did she born' ভুল)।

Question:
নিচের বাক্যের জন্য সঠিক WH প্রশ্নটি নির্বাচন করুন: "The museum opens at nine every morning."

Options:
ক. When the museum opens every morning?
খ. What time does the museum open every morning?
গ. At what time opens the museum every morning?
ঘ. Why does the museum open at nine every morning?


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
১) জানতে চাওয়া বিষয় — সময় (specific clock time) তাই 'What time' উপযুক্ত।
২) বাক্যটি present simple; প্রশ্ন গঠনে: What time + does + the museum + open + every morning?
৩) সঠিক প্রশ্ন: "What time does the museum open every morning?"

Explanation:
'What time' ব্যবহার করে নির্দিষ্ট সময় জানতে চাইলে present simple প্রশ্নে 'does' লাগবে কারণ subject singular (the museum)। ক তে auxiliary (does) নেই এবং শব্দক্রম ভুল, গ তে auxiliary ও subject inversion সঠিক হয়নি (সঠিক হবে 'At what time does the museum open every morning?'), কিন্তু সাধারণ বা স্বাভাবিক প্রশ্ন হিসেবে 'What time does...' সবচেয়ে প্রাকৃতিক ও সঠিক। ঘ তে 'why' প্রশ্ন করলে কারণ জানতে চাওয়া হবে, যা এখানে উদ্দেশ্য নয়।

Question:
When ---------- the telephone?

Options:
ক. did Bell invent
খ. Bell invented
গ. does Bell invent
ঘ. has Bell invented


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Correct option: ক — 'did Bell invent'.
Structure: When + did + subject + base verb (invent) is used to form a past simple question.

Explanation:
We ask about a past event, so we use the auxiliary 'did' + base form of the verb: 'When did Bell invent the telephone?' Option খ ('Bell invented') is a statement order, not a question. গ ('does Bell invent') uses present tense and wrong auxiliary for a past event. ঘ ('has Bell invented') is present perfect and doesn't fit the simple past time query.

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Correct option: ক — 'did Edison invent'.

Explanation:
The question asks about when something happened in the past, so the correct interrogative form is 'When did Edison invent the light bulb?' Option খ is a declarative clause, গ is present simple (wrong tense), and ঘ uses present perfect which is not the appropriate form for a simple past time question.

Identify the correct sentence:

Options:
ক. We waited for him, he never arrived.
খ. We waited for him; he never arrived.
গ. We waited for him, he never arrived?
ঘ. We waited for him. he never arrived.


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Choose the sentence that correctly joins two independent clauses: "We waited for him; he never arrived."

Explanation:
Two independent clauses ('We waited for him' and 'he never arrived') cannot be joined by a comma alone (that creates a comma splice). A semicolon correctly links closely related independent clauses without a conjunction. A period would be acceptable only if the following clause begins with a capital letter ('We waited for him. He never arrived.'), but option ঘ uses a lowercase 'he', so it is incorrect. Option গ incorrectly uses a question mark.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Select the form that correctly punctuates a direct question followed by a dialogue tag: "Is the door locked?" he asked.

Explanation:
When the quoted material is a direct question, the question mark belongs inside the quotation marks. The dialogue tag that follows (he asked) is not a question itself and therefore is not followed by an additional question mark. Option ঘ wrongly uses a comma inside the quotes instead of the question mark; options ক and খ omit the required question mark inside the quotation.

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Pick the sentence that properly introduces a list: "List the supplies as follows: pencils, notebooks, and glue."

Explanation:
A colon is used to introduce a list after an independent clause. Option গ correctly places a colon after 'as follows' and includes commas between list items (including the optional Oxford comma before 'and glue'). Option ক omits the colon. Option খ uses an unnecessary comma before 'as follows' and omits the Oxford comma (though omission is stylistic, the comma before 'as follows' is incorrect). Option ঘ uses a semicolon, which is not the standard punctuation for introducing a simple list.

Options:

খ. To whom this book does belong?

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Form the question with auxiliary ‘does’ + subject + main verb, and use the object pronoun 'whom' with the preposition 'to' fronted: 'To whom does this book belong?'.

Explanation:
'Belong' requires the preposition 'to' for the owner. The owner is the object of the preposition, so 'whom' is correct (object form). Option ক uses 'who' (subject form) incorrectly. Option খ has wrong word order (missing auxiliary position). Option ঘ has incorrect subject–verb agreement ('belongs' with auxiliary 'does' is wrong).

Options:
ক. Whom were the letters addressed to?
খ. To whom were the letters addressed?

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
In the passive construction, use auxiliary 'were' + past participle 'addressed' and front the preposition with its object: 'To whom were the letters addressed?'.

Explanation:
The letters are the subject in passive voice; the recipient is the object of the preposition 'to', so 'whom' is correct. Option ক places the preposition at the end (acceptable in informal style) but the formal, fully correct word order is option খ. Option গ uses 'who' (wrong case). Option ঘ has incorrect word order (missing the auxiliary 'were' before the subject).

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Place the preposition 'to' before its object and use the object pronoun 'whom' with the correct auxiliary inversion: 'To whom should I give the keys?'.

Explanation:
Formally, the receiver of 'give' is the object of 'to', so 'whom' is correct. Option ক uses 'who' (subject form) which is informal/colloquial here.

Options:
ক. Why the students study late at night?
খ. Why do the students studies late at night?
গ. Why do students study late at night?
ঘ. Why students do study late at night?


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Interrogative sentence-এর সাধারণ রূপরেখা: W.H. word + auxiliary (do/does) + subject + main verb (base form) + ... । এখানে subject 'students' বহুবচন, তাই auxiliary হবে 'do' এবং main verb হবে base form 'study'। তাই সঠিক বাক্য: 'Why do students study late at night?'

Explanation:
প্রশ্নবোধক বাক্যে প্রধান (auxiliary) ক্রিয়ার পরেেই বিষয় (subject) আসে এবং মূল ক্রিয়া মূলরূপে (base form) থাকে। অপশন ক ও ঘ-তে auxiliary ও subject বিন্যাস ভুল আছে; অপশন খ-তে 'studies' ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে যা তৃতীয় পুরুষ একবচনের জন্য প্রযোজ্য, কিন্তু এখানে subject বহুবচন 'students'।

খ. When she arrived at the station?
গ. When did she arrive at the station?
ঘ. When did arrived she at the station?


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Past simple interrogative-এর কাঠামো: W.H. word + did + subject + main verb (base form) + ... । 'Arrive' এর past form 'arrived' কিন্তু প্রশ্নপদে যখন 'did' ব্যবহার করা হয় তখন মূল ক্রিয়া base form থাকবে। তাই সঠিক: 'When did she arrive at the station?'

Explanation:
অপশন ক-তে 'did' থাকার পরেও 'arrived' ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে (ভুল), অপশন খ-তে auxiliary 'did' অনুপস্থিত, অপশন ঘ-তে শব্দের ক্রমানুসারে ভুল আছে। অতএব গ সঠিক।

খ. How long has Rehana lived in Kolkata?
গ. How long has lived Rehana in Kolkata?
ঘ. How long has Reana lived in Kolkata?


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Present perfect interrogative-এর রীতি: W.H. word + has/have + subject + past participle + ... । এখানে subject 'Rehana' একবচন, তাই 'has' ব্যবহার হবে এবং main verb-এর past participle 'lived' হবে। সুতরাং সঠিক বাক্য: 'How long has Rehana lived in Kolkata?'

Explanation:
অপশন ক-তে auxiliary ও subject-এর স্থান পরিবর্তিত; অপশন গ-তে 'has' ও subject-এর বিন্যাস ভুল; অপশন ঘ-তে 'Reana' নামের বানান ভিন্ন হওয়ায় ভুল। অপশন খ-তেই সঠিক present perfect প্রশ্নগঠন মেনে চলে।

Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
WH word + auxiliary + subject + main verb (past participle-ing) বিন্যাস অনুযায়ী ইন্টারোগেটিভ ক্ষেত্রে অতীত কাল ধারাবাহিকের জন্য 'was/he/she/it + verb-ing' ব্যবহার করা হয়। এখানে 'What' হলো WH word, তাই যথাযথ পূরণ হবে 'was he doing'.

Explanation:
প্রশ্নটি ঘটনার সময়কার ক্রিয়া (past continuous) জানার জন্য। 'When the phone rang' অবস্থানটি অতীতে ধারাবাহিক ক্রিয়া নির্দেশ করে। তাই সঠিক উত্তর 'was he doing' (What was he doing when the phone rang?) কারণ 'did he do' হলো simple past, 'has he done' present perfect, এবং 'was he do' ভুল রূপ।

Explanation:
প্রশ্নে subject হিসেবে 'Who' আছে, তাই auxiliary (was/were) সরাসরি main verb-এর সাথে যায়: 'Who was talking when the teacher entered the classroom?' 'Was he talking' ভুল কারণ 'Who' ইতোমধ্যেই subject; 'are talking' present continuous এবং 'talked' simple past।

Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
Use the past continuous: 'were' + subject + verb-ing → 'were you shouting'.

Explanation:
The clause 'while the baby was sleeping' sets a past continuous time frame (an ongoing action in the past). To ask about another action happening at that same time, use past continuous: 'were you shouting'. Other options are wrong because they use simple past, present continuous, or present perfect, which don't match the simultaneous past action.

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Use past continuous to ask about an action in progress at a specific time in the past: 'was he doing'.

Explanation:
The reference 'at seven last night' indicates a specific past time when something may have been happening. The past continuous ('was he doing') asks about an ongoing activity at that past time. 'Did he do' (simple past) asks about a completed action without emphasizing it was in progress; 'had he done' is past perfect (earlier past), and 'does he do' is present simple, so they are inappropriate here.

Use past continuous for location or activity in progress at a past time: 'were you staying'.

The phrase 'an hour ago when I called' refers to a specific past moment. To ask about someone's location or temporary residence at that moment, use past continuous: 'Where were you staying?' Option b ('were you') is incomplete without a verb; c ('did you stay') is simple past and implies a completed action; d ('had you stayed') is past perfect, implying an action completed before another past event.

Explanation:
'Did' হল past simple auxiliary interrogative‑এ ব্যবহৃত সহায়ক ক্রিয়া; মূল verb‑টি base form 'leave' থাকবে। 'Does' present tense, 'had' past perfect পরিস্থিতি তৈরি করে (পরে participle লাগে), 'will' ভবিষ্যৎ।

The embedded question requires subject–verb order: 'who is responsible'. Option খ ('who') is incomplete, and 'whom' is incorrect because 'who' here is the subject of 'is'. 'That who is' is ungrammatical. Therefore 'who is' is the correct choice.

Question:
Which type of question typically requires more information than a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer?

Options:
ক. Yes/no question
খ. Open (wh-) question
গ. Tag question
ঘ. Rhetorical question that expects no answer


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Open (wh-) questions solicit detailed information rather than a binary yes/no response.

Explanation:
Open or wh- questions begin with words like who, what, where, when, why, or how and invite informative answers. Yes/no and tag questions generally expect brief affirmative or negative replies; rhetorical questions don't require an actual answer.

খ. Who left the keys on the table?
গ. Close the door, please.
ঘ. You will join us, won't you?


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
'Who left the keys on the table?' is a wh-question asking for the identity of a person.

Explanation:
Option খ begins with 'who', a wh-word, and asks for information. Option ক is a yes/no question, ঘ is a tag question expecting confirmation, and গ is an imperative (a command).

Question:
Choose the correct interrogative sentence.

Options:
ক. Where you are working?
খ. Where are you working?
গ. Where working are you?
ঘ. Where do you working?


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Wh-word + auxiliary + subject + main verb (present continuous uses am/are/is + verb-ing). So: Where + are + you + working?

Explanation:
In present continuous questions the structure is 'Wh-word + am/are/is + subject + verb-ing'. Option খ follows this rule. ক has subject and auxiliary reversed, গ has wrong word order, and ঘ uses the auxiliary 'do' which is not used with continuous forms.

Question:
Choose the correct interrogative sentence.

Options:
ক. Why he left early?
খ. Why did he leave early?
গ. Why does he left early?
ঘ. Why has he left early?


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
For simple past questions use 'Wh-word + did + subject + base form of verb'. So: Why + did + he + leave + early?

Explanation:
Option খ uses the correct past-question structure with 'did' + base verb 'leave'. ক lacks the auxiliary 'did' for past tense questions. গ is ungrammatical (mixes 'does' with past form 'left'). ঘ is present perfect and changes meaning (it asks about a present relevance), so it doesn't match the simple past form 'left'.

Question:
Choose the correct interrogative sentence.

Options:
ক. How many books she has?
খ. How many has she books?
গ. How many does she have?
ঘ. How many have she?


Correct Answer: গ

Solution:
For present simple quantity questions use 'Wh-word + do/does + subject + base verb'. With 'she' we use 'does': How many + does + she + have?

Explanation:
Option গ follows the correct structure. ক has subject and auxiliary in the wrong order. খ incorrectly places 'has' before the noun and uses the wrong order for questions. ঘ uses 'have' with 'she' without the correct auxiliary 'does', which is ungrammatical in present simple questions.

Question:
Which one is a grammatically correct short answer to the question - Have you ever been robbed?

Options:
ক. Yes, I have
খ. Yes, I had
গ. Yes, I was
ঘ. Yes, I did


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
ক. Yes, I have

Explanation:
The question uses the present perfect 'Have you ever been...?' to ask about life experience. The appropriate short answer uses the present perfect auxiliary: 'Yes, I have.' 'Yes, I had' is past perfect/simple past and doesn't match the auxiliary in the question. 'Yes, I was' and 'Yes, I did' are ungrammatical as direct short answers to this present perfect question.

Which one is the correct short answer to - Have you ever seen a shooting star?

Options:
ক. Yes, I have
খ. Yes, I did
গ. Yes, I saw
ঘ. Yes, I have seen


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
ক. Yes, I have

Explanation:
For 'Have you ever...?' the natural short answer is 'Yes, I have.' While 'Yes, I have seen' is grammatically complete, it is not the usual short form because it repeats the past participle; short answers normally use just the auxiliary. 'Yes, I did' and 'Yes, I saw' use past tense forms and do not match the present perfect auxiliary in the question.

Which response correctly answers - Have you ever met the president?

Options:
ক. Yes, I have
খ. Yes, I had
গ. Yes, I met
ঘ. Yes, I was meeting


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
ক. Yes, I have

Explanation:
The question asks about an experience using the present perfect. The correct short reply is 'Yes, I have.' 'Yes, I had' is incorrect tense; 'Yes, I met' is simple past (and could answer in full: 'Yes, I met him last year'), but as a short answer to the present perfect question we use 'Yes, I have.' 'Yes, I was meeting' is the past continuous and inappropriate here.

Question:
Did he _____ the letter yesterday?

Options:
ক. wrote
খ. write
গ. writing
ঘ. to write


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
প্রশ্নবাচক বাক্যে যদি 'did' থাকে তবে প্রধান ক্রিয়া(base form) ব্যবহার করতে হয় — এখানে সঠিক হলো 'write'।

Explanation:
‘Did’ ইতিবাচক অতীত সহায়ক হওয়ায় মূল verb-এর অবচেতন(base) রূপ লাগবে। 'wrote' হলো অতীত রূপ (ভুল), 'writing' হলো present participle (ভুল), 'to write' হলো অনির্দিষ্টকারক (ভুল)।

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
যেহেতু প্রশ্নে 'did' আছে, মূল ক্রিয়া(base form) ব্যবহার করতে হবে — সঠিক উত্তর 'enjoy'।

Explanation:
'Enjoyed' অতীত রূপ, 'enjoying' ক্রিয়ার বর্তমান অংশ, 'to enjoy' অনির্দিষ্টকারক; সবই ভুল কারণ সহায়ক 'did' থাকার পর base form ছাড়া অন্য কোনো রূপ ব্যবহার হয় না।

Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
প্রশ্নবাচক বাক্যে 'did' ব্যবহার করলে ক্রিয়ার মূল (base) রূপ লাগে — এখানে সঠিক হলো 'lose'।

Explanation:
'Lost' হল অতীত রূপ (ভুল), 'losing' হলো present participle (ভুল), 'to lose' অনির্দিষ্টকারক (ভুল)। 'Did' থাকার কারণে base form 'lose' ব্যবহার করাই সঠিক।

Question:
Which of the following sentences has the correct question tag?

Options:
ক. You won't forget my birthday, will you?
খ. You won't forget my birthday, don't you?
গ. You won't forget my birthday, will not you?
ঘ. You won't forget my birthday, won't you?


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
Choose the tag that is positive and matches the auxiliary verb and person of the main clause. 'Won't' is a negative auxiliary; the correct positive short tag is 'will you?'.

Explanation:
For tag questions, a negative main clause takes a positive tag using the same auxiliary verb and addressing the same subject. Here the auxiliary is 'will' (contracted as 'won't'), so the correct tag is 'will you?'. Options খ and ঘ are incorrect because they use the wrong auxiliary form; গ is ungrammatical ('will not you?' should be 'will you?').

Select the sentence with the correctly formed question tag:

Options:
ক. She can speak French, can she?
খ. She can speak French, can't she?
গ. She can speak French, doesn't she?
ঘ. She can speak French, isn't she?


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
A positive clause with 'can' requires a negative tag using 'can't' and the appropriate subject pronoun: 'can't she?'.

Explanation:
When the main clause uses the modal 'can' positively, the tag must be negative and use the same modal: 'can't'. Therefore 'She can speak French, can't she?' is correct. Option ক uses a positive tag (wrong polarity), options গ and ঘ use incorrect auxiliaries for the modal 'can'.

Question:
Which option contains the correct tag question?

Options:
ক. There isn't any milk left, isn't there?
খ. There isn't any milk left, is there?
গ. There isn't any milk left, are there?
ঘ. There isn't any milk left, isn't it?


Correct Answer: খ

Solution:
Negative clause with 'isn't' requires a positive tag 'is there?' matching the auxiliary 'is' and the subject 'any milk' (treated as singular/uninflected).

Explanation:
The clause 'There isn't any milk left' is negative (uses 'isn't'), so the tag must be positive and mirror the auxiliary 'is' with the pronoun 'there': 'is there?'. Option ক mistakenly repeats negative polarity; গ uses plural 'are' which doesn't match the singular 'milk'; ঘ incorrectly uses 'isn't it' which doesn't match the existential 'there' construction.

Solution:
Where do you work?

Explanation:
We ask about the place or location of someone's job using 'Where'. 'What do you work?' would ask about the kind of job (e.g., 'I am a doctor'), 'When' asks about time, and 'How' asks about manner—none fit a location question.
