Question:
Love is merely a word.

Options:
a. What is love but a word?
b. Is love anything but a word?
c. What is nothing but a word?
d. Why is love a word?


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Turn the statement into a yes/no question by inverting the subject and verb and replacing 'merely' (or 'nothing but') with the corresponding interrogative form 'anything but'. 'Love is merely a word.' → 'Is love anything but a word?'

Explanation:
The original sentence asserts that love is only a word. To ask this as a direct question preserving meaning, invert 'Love is' to 'Is love' and change 'merely'/'nothing but' to 'anything but' for the interrogative: 'Is love anything but a word?' Option (a) is a different rhetorical phrasing, (c) is ungrammatical in context, and (d) asks for a reason rather than restating the assertion as a question.

Question:
Air pollution is one of the most serious issues in our cities. (Positive)

Options:
ক/a/ا. No other issue in our cities is as serious as air pollution
খ/b/ب. Very few issues in our cities are as serious as air pollution
গ/c/ج. Air pollution is much more serious than any other issue in our cities
ঘ/d/ث. Air pollution is the most serious issue in our cities


Correct Answer: খ/b/ب

Solution:
Change the superlative phrase 'one of the most serious issues' into a positive comparative form: 'one of the most ...' implies that only a small number of issues are equally serious. The positive equivalent is 'Very few issues in our cities are as serious as air pollution.'

Explanation:
'One of the most serious' indicates that only a few items share that high degree of seriousness. To convert to the positive degree, we express this meaning using phrases like 'very few' or 'not many' followed by 'are as ... as'. Thus the correct positive form is 'Very few issues in our cities are as serious as air pollution.' Options A, C and D either use different comparative/superlative structures or change the meaning.

Question:
I remember him. (make it complex)

Options:
ক/a/ا. I remember him.
খ/b/ب. I remember who he is.
গ/c/ج. I remember who is he.
ঘ/d/ث. I remember whom he is.


Correct Answer: খ/b/ب

Solution:
Replace the object pronoun 'him' with an embedded question clause. The correct form is 'who he is' (subject + verb order inside the clause): 'I remember who he is.'

Explanation:
When turning a simple sentence with a pronoun object into a complex (embedded) clause, use an interrogative word and keep normal statement word order inside the clause. 'Who he is' uses the correct subject-verb order. 'Who is he' is a direct question form (inverted) and is incorrect inside an embedded clause. 'Whom he is' is wrong because 'whom' is an object pronoun; after the verb 'is' we need the subject/predicate nominative 'who'. Leaving 'I remember him.' unchanged does not make it complex.

Question:
She heard him singing in the garden. (Compound)

Options:
a. She heard him and he was singing in the garden.
b. She heard who was singing in the garden.
c. She heard him to sing in the garden.
d. She hears in the garden which he was singing.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Correct option: a. Transform the object + present participle structure 'him singing' into a separate clause joined by 'and': 'She heard him and he was singing in the garden.'

Explanation:
The original sentence has a verb of perception ('heard') followed by an object ('him') and a present participle ('singing'). To make a compound sentence, split into two clauses: subject + main verb ('She heard him') and the subordinate action as an independent clause with appropriate tense ('he was singing in the garden'), joined by 'and'. Options b, c and d are ungrammatical or change the intended meaning/structure: b incorrectly uses 'who', c incorrectly uses an infinitive, and d has wrong word order and tense.

Question:
You should study hard for good results (Make it compound).

Options:
a. Study hard for good results.
b. Study hard to get good results.
c. Study hard and you will get good results.
d. You should study hard and you will get good results.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Transform the sentence into two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction. Take the imperative clause 'Study hard' and the result clause 'you will get good results', then join them with 'and' to form: 'Study hard and you will get good results.'

Explanation:
A compound sentence joins two independent clauses (each can stand alone) with a coordinating conjunction like 'and'. Option (c) correctly joins the command 'Study hard' (imperative clause) with the result clause 'you will get good results'. Option (a) is a simple sentence (not compound). Option (b) uses an infinitive of purpose ('to get') and is not a compound sentence. Option (d) is grammatically compound but retains the modal 'You should' before the first clause; the expected concise compound form matching the pattern of the original example is the imperative + result in (c).

Question:
Wisdom is more valuable than wealth. (Negative)

Options:
a. Wealth is not so valuable as wisdom.
b. Wisdom isn't as valuable than wealth.
c. Wealth is less valuable of wisdom.
d. Wealth not so valuable as wisdom.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Transform the comparative 'A is more ADJ than B' into negative form: 'B is not so ADJ as A.' Here A = Wisdom, B = Wealth. So: 'Wealth is not so valuable as wisdom.'

Explanation:
The standard negative form of 'X is more ADJ than Y' is 'Y is not so ADJ as X.' Option (a) correctly follows this structure. Option (b) is ungrammatical because 'as ... than' is incorrect (it should be 'as ... as' or use 'not so ... as'). Option (c) is incorrect because the preposition 'of' is wrong; the correct phrase would be 'less valuable than', but the instruction asked for the negative form. Option (d) is ungrammatical because it omits the auxiliary verb 'is'.

It is certain that she passed the exam. (Simple)

Options:
a. Certainly she passed the exam
b. It is certain that she is passed the exam
c. She is a certain passed the exam
d. She passed the exam and it is certain


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Replace the phrase 'It is certain that...' with the adverb 'Certainly' at the beginning of the sentence: 'Certainly she passed the exam.'

Explanation:
Option a correctly converts the impersonal construction 'It is certain that...' into a simple sentence using the adverb 'Certainly'. Option b is ungrammatical ('is passed' is incorrect here). Option c has wrong word order and is nonsensical. Option d, while conveying the same meaning, is a longer equivalent rather than the requested simple form using a single adverb, so it does not match the targeted transformation.

Options:

খ/b/ب. It is a beautiful painting
গ/c/ج. It is most beautiful painting
ঘ/d/ث. It is a more beautiful painting


Correct Answer: খ/b/ب

Solution:
Convert the exclamatory sentence 'What a beautiful painting!' into an assertive sentence by using 'It is' + adjective + noun: 'It is a beautiful painting.'

Explanation:
'What a + adjective + noun!' exclamations are converted into assertive form as 'It is a + adjective + noun.' Adding words like 'very', 'most' or 'more' changes the meaning or yields ungrammatical forms here ('most beautiful painting' needs 'the' or a different structure). The correct neutral assertive form is 'It is a beautiful painting.'

খ/b/ب. No other boy runs as fast as he does.
গ/c/ج. No other boy run as fast as he.
ঘ/d/ث. No any other boy runs so fast as he.


Correct Answer: খ/b/ب

Solution:
Convert the superlative phrase "the fastest of all the boys" into a positive comparison using the pattern "No other + singular noun + verb + as + adjective/adverb + as + subject." The correct positive form is: "No other boy runs as fast as he does."

Explanation:
Option খ/b/ب is correct because it uses the proper comparative structure and subject pronoun with the appropriate auxiliary verb (does) implied: "as fast as he does." Option ক/a/ا uses the object pronoun "him," which is less formal/grammatically prescriptive here. Option গ/c/ج has incorrect verb agreement ('run' instead of 'runs'). Option ঘ/d/ث is unidiomatic ('No any other' is incorrect and the phrasing is awkward).

Options:
a. No other practices are as harmful as bribery
b. Very few practices are as harmful as bribery
c. No other practice is as harmful as bribery
d. Very few practices is as harmful as bribery


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Transform 'X is one of the most + adjective + plural noun' into a sentence expressing that only a small number share that quality: 'Very few + plural noun + are as + adjective + as + X.' Thus: 'Very few practices are as harmful as bribery.'

Explanation:
'One of the most harmful practices' implies that only a small number of practices are equally harmful. The correct positive form is 'Very few practices are as harmful as bribery.' Option (a) is ungrammatical/unnatural in meaning, (c) is stronger (singular) and changes meaning to 'the single most harmful,' and (d) is grammatically incorrect ('practices is').

Question:
She tried her utmost. (Negative)

Options:
ক/a/ا. She did not make the least effort.
খ/b/ب. She spared no effort
গ/c/ج. She made no attempts
ঘ/d/ث. She held back her efforts


Correct Answer: খ/b/ب

Solution:
Convert the affirmative idea 'tried her utmost' into a negative idiomatic form: 'spare no effort' means to make every possible effort. So the negative-form sentence is 'She spared no effort.'

Explanation:
The original sentence means she made every possible effort. The idiom 'spare no effort' expresses this using a negative word 'no' (i.e., 'She spared no effort' = 'She did everything she could'). The other options change the meaning: 'She did not make the least effort' and 'She made no attempts' imply she made no effort at all (opposite meaning), and 'She held back her efforts' implies she restrained her efforts (also opposite). Therefore option খ/b/ب is correct.

Options:
ক/a/ا. Study hard and you will pass
খ/b/ب. Study hard or you will fail
গ/c/ج. Without studying hard you will pass
ঘ/d/ث. You study hard and will fail


Correct Answer: খ/b/ب

Solution:
The sentence 'Unless you study hard, you will fail.' can be rewritten by replacing 'Unless P, Q' with 'P or Q'. Here P = 'you study hard' and Q = 'you will fail'. So the compound form is: 'Study hard or you will fail.'

Explanation:
‘Unless’ means 'if not'. 'Unless you study hard, you will fail' = 'If you do not study hard, you will fail'. Converting this to a compound sentence uses 'or': 'Study hard or you will fail.' The other options are incorrect: option ক/a/ا changes the consequent to a positive result (pass) which isn't equivalent; গ/c/ج asserts the opposite consequence; ঘ/d/ث contradicts the intended meaning.

He was one of the laziest students in the class. (Make Positive)

Options:
a. Very few students in the class were so lazy as he
b. Very few students in the class was so lazy as he
c. Very few students in the class were as lazy as him
d. Very few students in the class was so lazy so he


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Transform the superlative "one of the laziest" into a positive comparative: "Very few students in the class were so lazy as he." Use plural verb "were" to agree with "students" and formal nominative "he" (ellipsis of "was").

Explanation:
Option (a) is correct because it correctly converts the superlative to a positive sentence: "Very few... were so lazy as he (was)." (b) is wrong due to singular verb "was" with plural subject "students." (c) is colloquially acceptable but less formal because it uses the objective pronoun "him" instead of the nominative "he." (d) is ungrammatical in structure ("was so lazy so he").

Question:
The negative form of "The glass is full" is

Options:
a. The glass is not full
b. The glass is not empty
c. The glass is empty
d. The glass never full


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Take the opposite (antonym) of the predicate "full", which is "empty", and place "not" before it: "The glass is not empty."

Explanation:
In this type of negative transformation the predicate is replaced by its opposite and negated. "Full" and "empty" are opposites, so the negative form of "The glass is full" becomes "The glass is not empty." (Note: the literal logical negation would be "The glass is not full," but the question follows the common pattern of using the antonym plus "not" as in the original example.)

খ/b/ب. No sooner had the bell rung than the students had left the hall
গ/c/ج. No sooner had the bell rung than the students left the hall
ঘ/d/ث. The students left the hall when the bell rang


Correct Answer: গ/c/ج

Solution:
Transform 'As soon as...' into the negative inversion 'No sooner... than...'. Change the first clause to past perfect: 'had + past participle (rung)'. Keep the second clause in simple past. Result: 'No sooner had the bell rung than the students left the hall.'

Explanation:
The negative correlative structure 'No sooner... than...' requires inversion and the use of past perfect in the first clause when referring to a past event. 'Bell rang' (simple past) becomes 'had rung' (past perfect). The action that immediately followed stays in simple past: 'the students left.' Option ক is ungrammatical (no inversion). Option খ incorrectly uses past perfect in the second clause as well. Option ঘ is an affirmative rephrasing, not the required negative structure.

Options:

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Everyone likes a comedian → There is no person who hates a comedian → Nobody hates a comedian.

Explanation:
To name the negative equivalent, express the universal affirmative in terms of the negation of the opposite predicate. Saying 'Everyone likes a comedian' rules out anyone who 'hates a comedian.' Thus the negative form is 'Nobody hates a comedian.'

Options:
a. They always remain silent when they are not questioned.
b. They never remain silent when they are not questioned.
c. They never remain silent when questioned.
d. They always do not remain silent when not questioned.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Change 'always' to 'never' and negate the condition 'when questioned' to 'when they are not questioned' to form the negative: "They never remain silent when they are not questioned."

Explanation:
To form the negative counterpart in this style, replace the universal term 'always' with 'never' and negate the clause introduced by 'when' (questioned → not questioned). Option (b) correctly applies both changes and is grammatically correct. Other options either fail to negate the condition correctly (a), negate the wrong clause (c), or are ungrammatical (d).

b. It is unfortunately that he failed.
c. He failed unfortunately.
d. It is unfortunate that he failed.


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Choose d. 'It is unfortunate that he failed.' is the grammatically correct and natural way to express regret about his failing.

Explanation:
Option d uses the adjective 'unfortunate' with the dummy subject 'It' and a 'that'-clause, which is the correct formal structure. Option a is ungrammatical ('failed' is not used with 'is' as a passive here). Option b incorrectly places the adverb 'unfortunately' between 'is' and the 'that'-clause; the adjective 'unfortunate' is required. Option c ('He failed unfortunately') is understandable but less natural and stylistically inferior to option d; it's also not the best formal expression of regret.

Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Despite the pandemic striking many countries, Bangladesh has sustained a strong rate of economic growth.

Explanation:
Option (d) correctly converts the two clauses into a single simple sentence showing contrast by using 'Despite'. Option (a) is incorrect because it uses a full stop after the subordinate clause, creating a sentence fragment; it should use a comma if 'Though' is chosen. Option (b) is wrong in meaning because 'Since' suggests cause rather than contrast. Option (c) merely links the clauses with 'and', which does not express the contrast implied in the original sentence.

Options:
a. The castle was more old than the church.
b. The church was older than the castle.
c. The castle were older than the church.
d. The church was more older than the castle.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Convert 'X was not so ADJ as Y' into 'Y was ADJ-er than X'. Here ADJ = 'old', so the correct comparative is 'The church was older than the castle.'

Explanation:
The original negative comparison 'was not so old as' is equivalent to saying the other thing is 'older than' it. For short adjectives like 'old' we form the comparative with -er ('older'), not with 'more old'. Also ensure correct subject-verb agreement ('castle' is singular, so 'was', but the transformed sentence makes 'church' the subject: 'The church was older than the castle.'). Options a and d use incorrect comparative forms ('more old', 'more older'), and option c has wrong verb agreement ('were').

Options:
a. She is tired and continues working

Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Combine the two clauses to show contrast. "Although she is tired" expresses contrast with "she continues working". The coordinating conjunction that shows contrast is "but": "She is tired but continues working."

Explanation:
"Although" introduces a contrast. To convert to a compound sentence, use a coordinating conjunction that reflects contrast — "but". Options b and d use "as/since" which indicate reason, changing the meaning, and option a uses "and", which only links ideas without indicating contrast.

Options:
a. What a talented singer she is!

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Transform the sentence into an exclamatory using 'What a/an + adjective + noun + subject + verb'. "She is a very talented singer." → "What a talented singer she is!" (the word "very" is usually omitted in this pattern).

Explanation:
Option (a) follows the correct exclamatory structure: What a + adjective + noun + subject + verb. Option (b) is ungrammatical because it lacks the article 'a' before 'singer'. Option (c) has incorrect word order for an exclamation (the subject and verb are misplaced). Option (d) also has wrong word order and an unnecessary article placement, making it ungrammatical.

It is more than charity. (Make it 'Positive')

Options:
a. Charity is not as much as it
b. Charity are not as much as it
c. Charity is as much as it
d. Charity is less much as it


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Change the sentence by making 'charity' the subject and expressing the comparison in positive form: 'Charity is not as much as it.'

Explanation:
The original sentence compares an unspecified 'it' with 'charity' using 'more than'. To convert into a positive comparison with 'charity' as subject, we use the structure 'X is not as much as Y' (meaning Y is greater). Thus 'It is more than charity.' becomes 'Charity is not as much as it.' Options (b), (c) and (d) are grammatically incorrect or do not preserve the intended comparative meaning.

Correct Answer: খ/b/ب

Solution:
Replace 'only' with its negative equivalent 'not more than' to form the negative sentence: 'She was not more than ten minutes late.'

Explanation:
'Only' in the sentence limits the extent (ten minutes). To express the negative of such a restrictive statement, we say 'not more than' to indicate the lateness did not exceed ten minutes. Other options either invert the meaning ('not less than') or change the structure to exclusivity ('no one/none but'), which do not represent the correct negative transformation.

c. She sent me an important letter
d. She sent me an importantly letter


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
She sent me an important letter.

Explanation:
The clause 'which was important' describes 'letter' and can be reduced by placing the adjective 'important' before the noun. Because 'important' begins with a vowel sound, the correct article is 'an'. Therefore the correct simple sentence is 'She sent me an important letter.' Options a and d are ungrammatical (wrong word order or wrong form), and b uses the wrong article 'a' instead of 'an'.

খ/b/ب. He finished his work so that he could start another.
গ/c/ج. Finishing his work, he took a rest.
ঘ/d/ث. He finished and he will rest.


Correct Answer: ক/a/ا

Solution:
Transform the simple sentence into a compound one by adding a related independent clause and joining them with a coordinating structure. Using 'not only ... but also ...' gives: 'He not only started the work but also finished it.'

Explanation:
Option ক/a/ا correctly creates a compound sentence with two related independent clauses joined by the correlative conjunction 'not only...but also', preserving meaning. Option খ/b/ب introduces a purpose clause ('so that'), making it complex rather than a compound. Option গ/c/ج uses a participial phrase and is a complex/participial construction, not a compound sentence. Option ঘ/d/ث joins two clauses but changes tense/aspect and logical relationship, so it is not the proper compound form that preserves the original meaning.

Question:
What is the comparative form of 'Rehana is the tallest girl in the school'?

Options:
a. Rehana is taller than any other girl in the school.
b. Rehana is taller than most other girls in the school.
c. Rehana is taller than all other girls in the school.
d. Other girls in the school are taller than Rehana.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Change the superlative 'the tallest' into the comparative 'taller' and compare Rehana with the rest using 'than any other'. So: 'Rehana is taller than any other girl in the school.'

Explanation:
A superlative like 'the tallest' becomes a comparative by using 'taller than' plus a phrase to indicate comparison. 'Taller than any other girl...' correctly expresses that she is taller than each of the others. Option b ('most other') changes the meaning (she's taller than many but not necessarily all). Option c ('all other girls') is grammatically possible but the standard and expected comparative parallel to 'the best' is 'than any other'. Option d reverses the meaning.

Question:
We must finish our work now. (Imperative)

Options:
ক/a/ا. Let us finish our work now.
খ/b/ب. Finish our work now.
গ/c/ج. We should finish our work now.
ঘ/d/ث. We must have finished our work now.


Correct Answer: ক/a/ا

Solution:
Convert the first-person plural necessity into an inclusive imperative: replace 'We must' with 'Let us' followed by the base verb. So 'We must finish our work now.' becomes 'Let us finish our work now.'

Explanation:
When giving a command or urging action that includes the speaker and others (first-person plural imperative), English uses 'Let us' (or the contraction 'Let's') + base verb. 'We must' expresses obligation, so the imperative form is 'Let us finish our work now.' Options খ and গ are not correct imperative forms (খ is a direct command to others without 'us', গ retains a modal and is not imperative), and ঘ is incorrect tense/structure.

Question:
What a clever boy he is! (Assertive)

Options:
ক/a/ا. He is cleverly a boy
খ/b/ب. He is a very clever boy
গ/c/ج. He is so clever
ঘ/d/ث. He is clever boy


Correct Answer: খ/b/ب

Solution:
Convert the exclamatory sentence to an assertive form: 'What a clever boy he is!' → 'He is a very clever boy.'

Explanation:
The exclamation 'What a clever boy he is!' follows the pattern 'What a + noun phrase + subject + be'. To make it assertive, rearrange to 'Subject + be + a + (degree word if needed) + adjective + noun'. Here 'very' is used to convey the emphasis of the exclamation, so the correct assertive form is 'He is a very clever boy.'

Question:
Everybody likes chocolate. (Interrogative)

Options:
ক/a/ا. Who does not like chocolate?
খ/b/ب. Who do not like chocolate?
গ/c/ج. Whom does not like chocolate?
ঘ/d/ث. Do all like chocolate?


Correct Answer: ক/a/ا

Solution:
Replace the universal subject 'Everybody' with the interrogative 'Who' and use the singular auxiliary 'does' (because 'everybody' is singular). Form the negative question: 'Who does not like chocolate?'.

Explanation:
'Everybody' is an indefinite singular subject, so when converting to an interrogative that asks for exceptions we use 'Who' plus singular auxiliary 'does' and 'not' for the negative: 'Who does not like chocolate?'. Options with 'do' or 'whom' are grammatically incorrect here; 'Do all like chocolate?' is a different (yes/no) question, not the required negative interrogative.

Sink or swim. (Make it simple)

Options:
a. By sinking you will swim
b. Without swimming you will sink
c. By swimming you will sink
d. Without sinking you will swim


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
The phrase 'Sink or swim' means either you swim (succeed) or you sink (fail). Restated simply: if you do not swim, you will sink — option b.

Explanation:
This idiom presents two outcomes: swimming (surviving/succeeding) or sinking (failing). The simplest equivalent sentence is 'Without swimming you will sink,' which directly captures the contrast in the original phrase.

Question:
Choose the answer that is closest in meaning to the following sentence : Even though liver cells and skin cells perform different tasks and look different, they carry the same genetic instructions in their DNA.

Options:
a. Because they perform different tasks, liver and skin cells contain different DNA.
b. Liver cells and skin cells differ in appearance and function, yet they contain identical genetic information in their DNA.
c. All body cells look alike since they share identical DNA.
d. Although their DNA is different, liver and skin cells perform similar functions.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Option b correctly restates that despite differences in appearance and function, liver and skin cells have the same genetic information (DNA).

Explanation:
The original sentence says that even with differences in tasks and appearance, the cells have the same genetic instructions. Option b preserves that contrast and the idea of identical genetic information. Option a reverses the relationship (claims different DNA), option c incorrectly asserts identical appearance, and option d incorrectly states their DNA is different and that they perform similar functions—both contradict the original meaning.

Question:
"Birds of a feather flock together" The complex form of the sentence is

Options:
a. Since birds are of a feather, they flock together.
b. Birds that are of a feather flock together.
c. Birds who have the same feather flock together.
d. Birds of a feather that flock together.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Birds that are of a feather flock together.

Explanation:
The phrase "of a feather" is converted into a relative clause "that are of a feather" to form the complex sentence. Option (b) correctly uses the relative pronoun "that" and preserves the original meaning and word order. Option (a) changes the meaning by introducing a causal connector "Since" and splits the subject. Option (c) is awkward and less idiomatic because "who" is normally used for people and "have the same feather" is unidiomatic. Option (d) is ungrammatical because the reduced clause "that flock together" incorrectly attaches to "a feather" rather than to "Birds."

Question:
Run or you'll miss the bus. (Simple)

Options:
ক/a/ا. If you don't run, you will miss the bus
খ/b/ب. If you run, you will miss the bus
গ/c/ج. You run, you will miss the bus
ঘ/d/ث. Run and miss the bus


Correct Answer: ক/a/ا

Solution:
The sentence 'Run or you'll miss the bus' expresses a conditional negative: failure to run will cause you to miss the bus. This is best paraphrased as 'If you don't run, you will miss the bus.'

Explanation:
'Or' here means 'otherwise' (i.e., if you do not run). Option ক correctly converts that to a conditional with negation. Option খ wrongly asserts that running causes missing the bus (opposite meaning). Option গ is ungrammatical/informal and does not clearly express the conditional negative. Option ঘ is a choppy imperative coordination and does not convey the conditional 'otherwise' meaning.

গ/c/ج. In spite of her being tired, she finished the work.
ঘ/d/ث. She was tired but finished the work.


Correct Answer: ক/a/ا , গ/c/ج

Solution:
Complex: Although she was tired, she finished the work.
Simple: Despite her tiredness, she finished the work. or In spite of her being tired, she finished the work.

Explanation:
To convert a sentence beginning with 'Although' into a simple sentence of contrast, use 'Despite' or 'In spite of' + a noun/noun phrase or gerund. 'Despite' cannot be followed directly by a clause ('Despite she was tired' is incorrect). 'In spite of' followed by 'her being tired' or the noun 'her tiredness' is correct. Option ক and option গ follow this rule; খ is ungrammatical and ঘ is a compound sentence, not the required simple form.

c. We have to exercising regularly to stay healthy.
d. To stay healthy, we want to exercise regularly.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
We must exercise on a regular basis in order to maintain our health.

Explanation:
Option (a) correctly transforms the simple sentence into a more complex and formal one by using the phrases "on a regular basis" and "in order to" and replacing "stay healthy" with the more formal "maintain our health." Option (b) is ungrammatical ("can staying" is incorrect). Option (c) is ungrammatical ("have to exercising" should be "have to exercise"). Option (d) changes the meaning by expressing desire ("we want to") rather than obligation/necessity conveyed by "must."

a. He stayed up late and finished his work.
b. He stayed up late and finishing his work.
c. He stayed up late so that he could finish his work.
d. He stayed up late to finished his work.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Replace the infinitive of purpose "to finish" with a coordinated main clause using "and" and the past-tense verb to form a compound sentence: "He stayed up late and finished his work."

Explanation:
Option (a) correctly converts the purpose clause into a second main clause with a parallel past-tense verb, making a compound sentence. (b) is ungrammatical because "and finishing" mixes a conjunction with a present participle and does not form a proper clause. (c) is grammatically correct but is a complex sentence (uses a subordinate purpose clause), not a compound sentence. (d) is ungrammatical because "to finished" incorrectly uses the past participle after "to."

The interrogative form of the sentence "She can play the piano" is

Options:
a. Can she play the piano?
b. Does she can play the piano?
c. Can she plays the piano?
d. Is she can play the piano?


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Identify the auxiliary/modal verb 'can' and invert it with the subject 'she'. Keep the main verb in base form: 'play'. So the question becomes: 'Can she play the piano?'.

Explanation:
For yes/no questions with modal auxiliaries (can, will, must, etc.), place the modal before the subject and use the base form of the main verb. Options b and d are ungrammatical because they add an extra auxiliary (does/is) with the modal; option c is wrong because the main verb should be in base form ('play'), not 'plays'.

Options:
a. She reads none but magazines.
b. She reads nothing but magazines.
c. She reads but magazines.
d. She reads not more magazines.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Replace 'only' with the negative structure 'nothing but'. So: 'She reads nothing but magazines.'

Explanation:
'Only' in a sentence expressing exclusivity is commonly transformed into a negative form using 'nothing but' (meaning 'only'). The correct negative construction is 'subject + verb + nothing but + object'. The other options are ungrammatical or do not convey the correct negative-exclusive form: 'none but' is awkward here, 'but magazines' without 'nothing' is incomplete, and 'not more magazines' changes the meaning.

Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Aisha is a brave woman.

The relative clause 'a woman who is brave' can be reduced to the adjective phrase 'a brave woman'. Replacing it gives the simple sentence 'Aisha is a brave woman'. The other options use progressive ('is being'), perfect ('has been') or a negative form and do not match the simple declarative form of the original.

Options:
a. She was young and showed great wisdom
b. As she was young, she showed great wisdom
c. She was young but showed great wisdom
d. Since she was young, she showed great wisdom


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Replace the concessive subordinating conjunction 'Although' with the coordinating conjunction 'but' to show contrast between the two clauses: "She was young but showed great wisdom."

Explanation:
'Although' expresses contrast. In a compound (coordinate) sentence that preserves this contrast, we use 'but' to join two independent clauses. Options b and d make 'young' a cause (not contrast), and option a uses 'and' which does not convey the intended contrast.

Options:
a. Rahim cannot know the answer.
b. Only Rahim cannot know the answer.
c. None but Rahim knows the answer.
d. None but Rahim does not know the answer.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Replace 'Only' with the equivalent negative structure 'None but' (or 'No one but') while keeping the rest of the sentence unchanged: 'None but Rahim knows the answer.'

Explanation:
The affirmative 'Only Rahim knows the answer' means that no one except Rahim knows it. The negative equivalent that preserves meaning is 'None but Rahim knows the answer' (or 'No one but Rahim knows the answer'). Options a and b change the meaning to express inability rather than exclusivity; option d is self-contradictory and denies Rahim's knowledge, so c is correct.

Question:
Select the alternative which best expresses the meaning of the given sentence : "He is no less hardworking than Tina."

Options:
a. He is less hardworking than Tina.
b. He is more hardworking than Tina.
c. He is as hardworking as Tina.
d. He is not hardworking at all.


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
The phrase "no less hardworking than" means "not less hardworking than", i.e. he is at least as hardworking as Tina. The best concise equivalent is "He is as hardworking as Tina."

Explanation:
"No less ... than" denies the idea of being inferior in that quality; it indicates equality or superiority. So "He is no less hardworking than Tina" implies he is not less hardworking (he is as hardworking or even more hardworking). Among the options, "He is as hardworking as Tina" most directly captures the intended meaning.

What a lovely day it is! (Make it assertive)

Options:
a. It is a lovely day.
b. How lovely day is.
c. What lovely day is.
d. Lovely a day it is.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Transform the exclamatory sentence 'What a lovely day it is!' into an assertive sentence by changing the word order from 'What + a/an + adjective + noun + subject + verb' to 'subject + verb + a/an + adjective + noun'. So 'What a lovely day it is!' becomes 'It is a lovely day.'

Explanation:
Exclamatory sentences beginning with 'What a/an ...' are converted to assertive form by placing the subject before the verb and keeping the article and adjective with the noun: 'What a + adj + noun + subject + verb' → 'Subject + verb + a + adj + noun'. Punctuation changes from an exclamation mark to a full stop.

ক/a/ا. She went to the market to buying some vegetables.
খ/b/ب. She went to the market so that she buys some vegetables.
গ/c/ج. She went to the market and buy some vegetables.
ঘ/d/ث. She went to the market and bought some vegetables.


Correct Answer: ঘ/d/ث

Solution:
Replace the infinitive of purpose 'to buy' with a coordinated past-tense verb 'and bought' because both actions happened in the past: 'She went to the market and bought some vegetables.'

Explanation:
When converting a purpose clause formed with 'to + verb' into a compound sentence describing two completed actions, use 'and' plus the past tense of the verb. 'To buy' indicates the purpose of going; if the buying occurred, the correct compound is 'went ... and bought'. The other choices are ungrammatical or use incorrect tense/forms ('to buying' is wrong, 'so that she buys' uses present tense, 'and buy' uses base form instead of past).

Options:
a. Enter the room in order to shout.
b. Enter the room only to shout.
c. Enter the room and to shout.
d. As you enter the room, shout.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Replace the connective 'and' that links two actions (where the second is an unexpected/resultant action) with 'only to' to form the simple/resultative structure: 'Enter the room only to shout.'

Explanation:
The sentence 'Enter the room and shout.' expresses that the second action (shout) is the result or consequence of the first (enter). The simple/resultative form uses 'only to' to convey this: 'Enter the room only to shout.' Option (a) 'in order to shout' implies purpose/intention rather than an unexpected result, so it's different in meaning. Option (c) is grammatically incorrect. Option (d) changes the sense to a simultaneous instruction (shout as you enter) rather than the resultive/simple form.
