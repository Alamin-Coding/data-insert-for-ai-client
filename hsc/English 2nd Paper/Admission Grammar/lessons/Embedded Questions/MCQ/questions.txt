Question:
1- to New York,

Options:
a. was never been
b. am never gone
c. have never been
d. had never been


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
have never been

Explanation:
Use the present perfect 'have never been' to express lack of experience up to now. The structure is 'have/has' + past participle. 'Been' is the correct past participle of 'be' for visiting places. 'Had never been' is past perfect (used for an earlier past reference), while 'was never been' and 'am never gone' are ungrammatical mixes of tenses and forms.

Question:
The theory ___ ___ we rely explains many observations.

Options:
a. on which
b. that
c. which
d. on what


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
‘Rely’ is a verb that requires the preposition ‘on’ when indicating dependence. Because we need a relative pronoun plus the preposition, “on which” is correct: “The theory on which we rely…”

Explanation:
Options b and c (that/which) omit the necessary preposition ‘on’ after ‘rely’. Option d (‘on what’) is ungrammatical in this relative-clause context. Therefore, the formal and grammatically correct choice is “on which”.

Question:
Where --- the Eiffel Tower constructed?

Options:
a. has been
b. had been
c. was
d. is


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Choose 'was'. The correct sentence is: 'Where was the Eiffel Tower constructed?'

Explanation:
In WH-questions in the passive voice, a form of the verb 'be' must come between the WH-word and the subject. The main verb 'constructed' is a past participle, and the event happened in the past, so the past form 'was' is required. (Similar: 'Why was the man arrested?')

c. Where
d. Which


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
'Where' is correct: 'Where do you live?' asks about a place.

Explanation:
'Where' is used to ask about location or place. 'Who' asks about a person, 'What' asks about things or information, and 'Which' asks to choose from alternatives—none of which correctly ask for a place in this sentence.

Question:
Have you ever — New York?

Options:
a. been to
b. been in
c. gone to
d. gone in


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Use 'been to' for visiting a place and returning. 'Have you ever been to New York?' is the correct form.

Explanation:
When asking about past visits to places (with the idea the person may have returned), English uses 'been to'. 'Gone to' suggests the person went there and is still there now. 'Been in' or 'gone in' are not used in this context. Therefore the correct answer is 'been to'.

Question:
- you go to the gym? Which of the adverbials is fit to fill up the blank?

Options:
a. How long
b. When
c. How often
d. How many times


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
C. How often

Explanation:
"How often" asks about frequency (e.g., the number of times something happens regularly), so it correctly completes the question: "How often do you go to the gym?" "How long" asks about duration, "When" asks about time/date, and "How many times" is less natural here for a general habitual question.

Question:
I often travel to Sylhet. However, I have never - Srimangal.

Options:
a. went to
b. visited to
c. gone
d. been to


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
been to

Explanation:
When talking about experiences up to now we use the present perfect. To ask or state whether someone has visited a place we use 'been to' (e.g., Have you ever been to Dhaka?). 'Went to' is simple past and doesn't fit with 'have never'. 'Visited to' is incorrect because 'visit' does not take 'to' after it. 'Gone' (or 'gone to') implies the person went and is still there, whereas 'been to' indicates the person has visited and returned. Therefore the correct choice is 'been to'.

Question:
Could you please tell me—

Options:
a. where is the nearest post office?
b. where the nearest post office is?
c. where is the nearest post office at?
d. where nearest post office is?


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
The correct completion for an indirect question uses the statement word order (subject before verb): 'where the nearest post office is.' So option b is correct.

Explanation:
When turning a direct question into an indirect (reported) question after phrases like 'Could you please tell me', we do not use subject–auxiliary inversion. 'Where is the nearest post office?' (direct question) becomes 'where the nearest post office is' (indirect). Option a keeps the direct-question word order (incorrect). Option c wrongly adds 'at' and uses inversion. Option d omits the article 'the' and sounds ungrammatical. Therefore b is the grammatical indirect-question form.

Find out the correct sentence -

Options:
a. Do you know where does she work?
b. Do you know where she works?
c. Do you know where she work?
d. Do you know where does she works?


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
The correct sentence is: "Do you know where she works?"

Explanation:
When an interrogative clause is embedded in a larger sentence (an indirect question), we use statement word order, not subject–auxiliary inversion. Therefore we do not use "does" plus subject. Also the verb must agree with the third-person singular subject "she," so use "works." Hence option b is correct.

Question:
Identify the correct sentence -

Options:
a. Ask him where is he going.
b. Ask him where he is going.
c. Ask him where he going.
d. Ask him where is going he.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
After verbs like 'ask' we use an embedded (indirect) question. The correct word order for embedded questions is: question word + subject + verb. Therefore 'where he is going' is correct, making the full sentence: 'Ask him where he is going.'

Explanation:
Options show variations of embedded-question word order. In indirect questions we do not use the auxiliary inversion used in direct questions. 'Where is he going?' (direct) becomes 'where he is going' (embedded). Thus option b follows the proper embedded-question structure and is correct.

Question:
Select the right form of verb in the bracket : They ever (see) that movie?

Options:
a. Do they ever saw that movie?
b. Have they ever seen that movie?
c. Had they ever seen that movie?
d. Have they ever see that movie?


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Use present perfect for experience: auxiliary 'have' + past participle of 'see' (seen). Put auxiliary before subject to form a question: Have they ever seen that movie?

Explanation:
The sentence asks about an experience at an unspecified time, so present perfect is required. For questions in present perfect, place the auxiliary 'have/has' before the subject and use the past participle (V3). Therefore 'Have they ever seen that movie?' is correct. Options a and d have incorrect verb forms; c uses past perfect which is not appropriate here.

Choose the correct sentence :

Options:
a. She asked me where do I live.
b. She asked me where I live.
c. She asked me where do I lives.
d. She asked me where lives I.


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Embedded questions use the word order: question word + subject + verb (no auxiliary inversion). The direct question 'Where do I live?' becomes the embedded clause 'where I live'. Hence 'She asked me where I live.' is correct.

Explanation:
Options a and c incorrectly keep the auxiliary 'do' and invert subject and verb, which is not used in embedded questions. Option d incorrectly places the verb before the subject. Option b follows the correct structure for embedded questions and correct verb form.
