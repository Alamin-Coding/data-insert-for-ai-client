Question:
Which one is correct?

Options:
a. There comes the students
b. There come the students
c. There comes the student
d. There come the student


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
b. There come the students

Explanation:
ইনভার্শন (There + verb + subject) নিয়মে verb সর্বদা subject-এর সংখ্যার সাথে মিলিয়ে ব্যবহৃত হয়। এখানে subject 'students' যা বহুবচন, তাই verb হবে 'come' (বহুবচন)। ফলে সঠিক বাক্যটি: 'There come the students'। (তথ্যস্বরূপ, একবচন হলে সঠিক হবে 'There comes the student'.)

Question:
Often heard at dusk.

Options:
a. nightingales are
b. are nightingales
c. the nightingales are
d. are the nightingales


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Complete the sentence by inverting subject and verb after the fronted adverbial: "Often heard at dusk are nightingales."

Explanation:
The phrase "Often heard at dusk" is a fronted adverbial, which commonly triggers subject–verb inversion in this style (verb before subject). The correct continuation is "are nightingales," producing the grammatical sentence "Often heard at dusk are nightingales." Choice (c) "the nightingales are" would leave the sentence unfinished in order, and choice (a) "nightingales are" would produce an awkward order ("Often heard at dusk nightingales are"). Choice (d) "are the nightingales" would also be grammatical if you wanted to refer to specific nightingales already identified, but the indefinite plural "are nightingales" is the natural general statement here, so (b) is the best answer.

Question:
— than he left the room.

Options:
a. As soon as he noticed the stranger
b. No sooner had he noticed the stranger
c. No sooner he had noticed the stranger
d. As soon as he had noticed the stranger


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
The correct choice is 'No sooner had he noticed the stranger' because the sentence requires the correlative structure 'No sooner ... than ...' with subject–auxiliary inversion: 'No sooner had he noticed the stranger than he left the room.'

Explanation:
When using 'No sooner' we must invert the auxiliary and the subject (had he, did she, etc.) and follow with 'than'. Option (b) correctly uses the past perfect auxiliary 'had' before the subject 'he' and pairs with 'than'. Option (c) has the wrong word order (no inversion). Options (a) and (d) use 'As soon as', which does not pair with 'than' — while grammatically possible in a different sentence ('As soon as he noticed the stranger, he left the room'), they do not fit the given '— than he left the room.' construction.

We have completed the project and so –

Options:
a. have we
b. do we
c. did we
d. we have


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
We have completed the project and so have we.

Explanation:
The main clause is in the present perfect (have completed). To agree with this and show similarity, use the pattern 'so + auxiliary + subject'. Since the auxiliary is 'have', the correct form is 'so have we' (option a).

Question:
Choose the correct sentence

Options:
a. Hardly had he finished his work when it started to rain.
b. Hardly he had finished his work when it started to rain.
c. Hardly had he finished his work than it started to rain.
d. Hardly had finished he his work when it started to rain.


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Hardly had he finished his work when it started to rain.

Explanation:
With 'Hardly' (or 'Scarcely') at the beginning, the auxiliary undergoes inversion and the first clause uses the past perfect: 'Hardly had + subject + past participle'. The second clause uses simple past and is usually introduced by 'when'. Option (a) follows this rule. Option (b) has incorrect word order (no inversion). Option (c) wrongly uses 'than' instead of 'when'. Option (d) has incorrect word order and misplaced words.

Question:
Which one of the following completes the sentence? Hardly had the meeting begun –

Options:
a. before the guests arrived
b. then the guests arrived
c. as the guests arrived
d. when the guests arrived


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Hardly had the meeting begun when the guests arrived.

Explanation:
When a sentence begins with 'Hardly had + subject + past participle', the two parts are normally joined by 'when' to indicate that the second action happened immediately after the first. Thus 'Hardly had the meeting begun when the guests arrived' is correct. 'Before' and 'then' are not idiomatic here, and 'as' suggests simultaneous action rather than the immediate succession implied by 'hardly...when.'

Fill in the blank: No sooner had she sat down — the phone rang

Options:
a. than
b. when
c. before
d. just


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
No sooner had she sat down than the phone rang.

Explanation:
The correlative expression 'No sooner ... than ...' is the correct idiom to link two events that happen in quick succession. It also triggers subject–auxiliary inversion ('had she' instead of 'she had'). 'When' or 'before' do not form the required idiomatic pair here, and 'just' is not a conjunction.

Question:
'Hardly had she left -- the phone rang.

Options:
a. then
b. because
c. when
d. afterwards


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
Hardly + had + subject + past participle + when + subject + simple past. Correct sentence: 'Hardly had she left when the phone rang.'

Explanation:
'Hardly' at the start causes inversion (Had she left). It is followed by 'when' to introduce the event that happened immediately after. 'Then' and 'afterwards' don't fit the inversion/time-clause structure, and 'because' gives a causal meaning, not the immediate succession intended.

খ/b/ب. Hardly she had left when the phone rang
গ/c/ج. Hardly had she left but the phone rang
ঘ/d/ث. Hardly had she left than the phone rang


Correct Answer: ক/a/ا

Solution:
Hardly had she left when the phone rang.

Explanation:
After negative adverbials like 'hardly' at the beginning of a sentence, inversion of auxiliary and subject is required: 'Hardly had she left...'. The correct connective is 'when' to indicate that one event followed immediately after another. 'Hardly she had left...' has wrong word order, 'but' and 'than' are incorrect conjunctions in this structure.

Hardly had she finished cooking - the guests arrived.

Options:
a. than
b. if
c. then
d. when


Correct Answer: d

Solution:
Hardly had she finished cooking when the guests arrived.

Explanation:
With introductory negatives like 'Hardly', 'Scarcely' or 'No sooner' followed by inversion (Hardly had she...), the correct connector to show an immediate subsequent action is 'when'. 'Then' is not a subordinating conjunction here; 'than' is used in comparisons; 'if' expresses condition, so they are incorrect.

Correct Answer: খ/b/ب

Solution:
No sooner had the meeting started than the fire alarm went off.

Explanation:
The phrase 'No sooner... than...' is a fixed correlative structure used to link two events where the second follows immediately after the first. After 'No sooner' we use inverted auxiliary + subject, and the correct connector is 'than', not 'when' or 'then' or 'after'.

Question:
Scarcely had she arrived ________ the concert began.

Options:
a. then the concert began
b. when the concert began
c. than the concert began
d. the concert began


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Scarcely' is a negative adverbial that typically pairs with 'when' in this inverted construction: "Scarcely had she arrived when the concert began."

Explanation:
After negative/time adverbials like 'scarcely', 'hardly' or 'no sooner', English often inverts the auxiliary and subject (Scarcely had she arrived). The correct connector is 'when' to introduce the following event. 'No sooner' commonly pairs with 'than' (not 'scarcely'), 'then' is incorrect here, and omitting a connector (option d) is ungrammatical in this structure.

Question:
Hardly had she finished her speech — the lights went out

Options:
a. when
b. than
c. while
d. before


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Correct choice: when. The structure with 'Hardly/Scarcely + auxiliary + subject + past participle' is normally followed by 'when' (or sometimes 'before' in meaning, but the conventional collocation is 'when'). Here: 'Hardly had she finished her speech when the lights went out.'

Explanation:
After inversion with 'Hardly had...' the expected connector to introduce the almost immediate following event is 'when' (or in similar patterns 'than' with 'No sooner...than'). 'Than' is used with 'No sooner...than' (not with 'Hardly...'), 'while' indicates simultaneity/contrast and doesn't fit the immediate-sequence idiom, and 'before' would change the sense and is not the standard collocation after 'Hardly had...'.

Question:
Hardly had the teacher entered the classroom the students settled down.

Options:
a. when
b. than
c. before
d. No word is missing


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Insert 'when' after 'entered'. Correct sentence: 'Hardly had the teacher entered the classroom when the students settled down.'

Explanation:
With constructions beginning 'Hardly had ...', the two clauses are joined by 'when' (or sometimes 'before'), but the common and correct connector here is 'when'. 'Than' is used with the parallel construction 'No sooner ... than', not with 'Hardly had ...'. Therefore 'when' is the appropriate missing word.
