Question:
They discovered a leak and had to ------------ the water supply immediately.

Options:
a. turn on
b. turn off
c. put off
d. call off


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Turn off — means to stop the flow or supply. In this sentence they needed to stop the water supply immediately, so 'turn off' completes the sentence correctly.

Explanation:
'Turn on' is the opposite (to start the supply). 'Put off' means to postpone, which doesn't fit. 'Call off' means to cancel (usually events), not to stop a physical supply. Therefore 'turn off' is the appropriate phrasal verb.

Question:
The papers on the desk were blown ---------- when the window was opened.

Options:
a. out
b. off
c. away
d. up


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
Saying 'blown off' indicates that the wind removed the papers from the surface of the desk. Example: The papers were blown off the desk when the window was opened.

Explanation:
'Blow off' + object means the wind caused the object to come off a surface. 'Blown away' would suggest being carried a distance, but for removal from a surface 'blown off' is the most appropriate phrasal verb here.

The research team has brought ---------- a breakthrough ----- cancer research.

Options:
ক/a/ا. about, on
খ/b/ب. about, in
গ/c/ج. to, for
ঘ/d/ث. into, on


Correct Answer: খ/b/ب

Solution:
"bring about" is a phrasal verb meaning 'to cause' and is the correct verb phrase here. We also use "in" to indicate the field or area (e.g., in cancer research). So the correct pair is "about, in".

Explanation:
Use "bring about" to express causing something (a breakthrough). The preposition "in" follows to show the area or field where the breakthrough occurred: "a breakthrough in cancer research." Therefore: "brought about a breakthrough in cancer research."

b. tone down
c. break down
d. call off


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
'Tone down' means to reduce the intensity, force, or severity of something (e.g., to tone down a remark or reaction).

Explanation:
Tone down = make less strong or extreme. Turn down usually means to refuse or lower volume/heat; break down means to fail or collapse; call off means to cancel. Therefore 'tone down' is the correct phrasal verb for reducing intensity.

Question:
They ------- our invitation.

Options:
a. turned up
b. turned down
c. turned out
d. turned off


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
turned down — means 'refused' or 'declined'. In this sentence, the intended meaning is that they refused the invitation, so 'turned down' completes the sentence correctly.

Explanation:
'turned up' means 'arrived' or 'appeared' (not appropriate here). 'turned out' can mean 'proved to be' or 'attended' in some contexts, but not 'refuse'. 'turned off' usually means 'switch off' or 'cause dislike'. Therefore 'turned down' (refused) is the correct choice.

Question:
Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities and could ______ entire island nations within decades.

Options:
a. make up
b. put forward
c. wipe out
d. hold back


Correct Answer: c

Solution:
'Wipe out' (phrasal verb) — to destroy or eliminate something completely. In this sentence it correctly expresses that rising sea levels can completely destroy island nations.

Explanation:
The context speaks of a total loss caused by rising sea levels. 'Wipe out' conveys complete destruction, so it fits. 'Make up' means to constitute or invent; 'put forward' means to propose; 'hold back' means to restrain — none of these convey total destruction, so they are inappropriate here.

Question:
In many ecosystems, invasive species quickly ____ native plants, causing significant biodiversity loss.

Options:
a. put across
b. crowd out
c. run into
d. fall behind


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
'Crowd out' (phrasal verb) — to push something or someone out of a place or position by filling it up or occupying it.

Explanation:
The sentence describes invasive species displacing native plants, so 'crowd out' correctly expresses being forced out by competition or overcrowding. 'Put across' means to communicate or explain, 'run into' means to encounter unexpectedly, and 'fall behind' means to lag — none fit the context of displacement.

Question:
The lights were turned -------- by the storm.

Options:
a. off
b. out
c. up
d. down


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Use the phrasal verb 'turn off' to mean 'switch off'. In passive form, 'The lights were turned off' correctly shows the lights were switched off by the storm.

Explanation:
Among the choices, 'off' completes the phrasal verb 'turn off' (to switch something off). 'Turn out' can mean to extinguish but is less natural in this passive construction for electrical lights; 'up' and 'down' do not fit the meaning.

Correct Answer: d

Solution:
'Put out' means to annoy or inconvenience someone (e.g., "I don't want to put you out by asking for a favor.").

Explanation:
‘Put out’ is commonly used to mean causing someone trouble or inconvenience. The other options do not fit: 'put up with' means to tolerate or endure; 'put off' means to postpone or discourage; 'put through' usually means to connect by phone or to subject someone to an experience.

Explanation:
'Bring about' is a phrasal verb meaning to cause or produce an outcome (e.g., "The new law brought about significant changes"). The other choices do not match this meaning: 'delay' means to postpone, 'carry in' refers to physical movement, and 'protect' means to guard.

The editor had to go ------ the manuscript to remove the errors. Choose the right word to fill in the blank?

Options:
a. through
b. over
c. up
d. on


Correct Answer: b

Solution:
The correct phrasal verb is "go over," which means to examine or review something carefully. So the sentence means the editor reviewed the manuscript to correct mistakes.

Explanation:
Here "go over" = review/check. "Go through" can also mean examine but in this context "go over the manuscript" is the most natural collocation for editing. "Go up" and "go on" do not fit the meaning of reviewing a text.

Options:

Correct Answer: a

Solution:
Correct answer: 'in' — 'steps in' means to intervene or get involved to resolve a situation.

Explanation:
'Steps in' is the appropriate phrasal verb meaning to intervene. 'Steps up' means to increase effort or take greater responsibility (not specifically to intervene in a dispute), 'steps over' suggests physically going over something, and 'steps away' means to withdraw or distance oneself, which is the opposite of intervening.

Question:
They carried --------- a campaign --------- public health.

Options:
a. out, for
b. on, about
c. through, in
d. off, on


Correct Answer: a

Solution:
carry out — a phrasal verb meaning 'to perform/execute'. 'Campaign for' is the correct collocation when indicating the purpose or beneficiary. So: 'They carried out a campaign for public health.'

Explanation:
The verb + particle 'carry out' fits the action of conducting a campaign. The preposition 'for' expresses the purpose or benefit (a campaign for public health). Other choices are incorrect: 'carry on a campaign' is possible but would use 'carry on' with 'a campaign on/against' for topic, not 'about'; 'through a campaign in' and 'off on' are unidiomatic here.
