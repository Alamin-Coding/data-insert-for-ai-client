Question:
“Have you seen your mother, Jerry?”

“I see her every summer. She sends for me.”

I wanted to cry out. ‘Why are you not with her? How can she let you go away again?” He said, “She comes up here    from Mannville whenever she can. She does not have a job now.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer is that Jerry does not live with his mother year‑round: “She sends for me” means she asks him to come to her in the summer. His lines that she “comes up here from Mannville whenever she can” and “does not have a job now” explain why she cannot have him stay with her or visit more often.

Question:
“I came here yesterday from my village,” he said. ‘Why did you come?” I asked. “My mother sent me to you with this letter.” “How is your mother? I have not seen her for a long time. I hope she is quite well.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Reported speech shifts tense one step back, changes pronouns and time words, and removes quotation marks. So "I came here yesterday from my village" becomes "he said that he had come there the day before from his village," and questions like "Why did you come?" become "I asked why he had come." Similarly, "My mother sent me to you with this letter" becomes "he said that his mother had sent him to me with that letter," and "How is your mother? I have not seen her for a long time. I hope she is quite well." becomes "I asked how his mother was, said I had not seen her for a long time, and hoped she was quite well."

Question:
“Where are you from?” said the teacher. “I am from Nepal,” said the student. “How did you find Dhaka when you first arrived?” said the teacher. “Well, I like it. I think the city is very beautiful.” said the student.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
It’s correct because the student answers the teacher’s question about first impressions by giving a personal opinion—“I like it” and “I think the city is very beautiful.” When someone asks “How did you find…?” they expect a reaction or impression, so you should describe your feelings or observations (e.g., “I liked it,” “It seemed busy/beautiful/interesting”).

Question:
Once I asked a little girl. “What is your mother’s name?” She replied cleverly, “I know my mother’s name but I won’t tell you that.” I said, “What a celever girl you are! May you prosper in life.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The mother's name is "May". When the speaker says "May you prosper in life" he unintentionally uses "May" as a proper name, so by that remark he has actually spoken her mother's name—it's a wordplay on "may" as both a name and a wish.

Question:
Once I said to a sweet girl. “What is your mother’s name?”

She replied cleverly, “I know my mother’s name but I won’t tell you that.”

I said, “What a clever girl you are!”

“I don’t tell my mother’s name to anybody whom I don’t know.” She spoke with an air of confidence.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: The girl’s reply “I know my mother’s name but I won’t tell you that” can be read literally — she used the word “that” as the name. So by her words, her mother’s name is “That,” a wordplay where a refusal doubles as the name.

“Follow my example,” she said as we shook hands, “and never eat more then one thing for luncheon.” ‘I’ll do better than that,” I retorted “I’ll eat nothing for dinner for tonight.” “Humourist, quite a humourist!’ she cried gaily, jumping into a cab.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct version fixes word choice and punctuation: use "than" (comparison) not "then", and change "for dinner for tonight" to "for dinner tonight" to remove redundancy. Also keep consistent double quotation marks and place commas and exclamation marks inside the closing quotes (e.g., "I’ll do better than that," I retorted; "Humourist, quite a humourist!").

“You look a little bit like my mother,” he said, “especially in the dark by the fire.” “But you were only four, Jerry, when you came here.” the writer said. “My mother lives in Mannville.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The line "My mother lives in Mannville" is spoken by the boy ("he" = Jerry), so "my mother" refers to Jerry’s mother. The preceding remark ("You look a little bit like my mother") and the writer’s reply confirm Jerry is comparing the narrator to his own mother and then stating where she lives.

“Why are you putting the foods in your pocket, Sir?” Why don’t you eat?” asked the nobleman. “I’m doing the right thing. My dress deserves these rich dishes,” replied Sheikh Saadi. “I’m sorry. I don’t understand what you mean to say,” said the nobleman.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: Sheikh Saadi’s reply is ironic—he pretends to put food in his pocket so his poor clothes can “wear” rich dishes, which highlights the absurdity of valuing outward show over real needs. The line uses satire to criticize vanity and social pretensions, so the correct answer points to irony/satire about appearance versus substance.

Solution:


Explanation:
This line shows Della’s urgency and willingness to act: she accepts Madame’s offer immediately because she needs cash right away to buy Jim’s gift. It reveals her self-sacrifice and determination—she sells her hair without hesitation to achieve her goal. This moment highlights the story’s theme of love motivating quick, painful choices.

Explanation:
The porter refuses to go because he is eager to hear the stories of his companions; his curiosity and desire for the entertainment outweigh the immediate offer of freedom. This shows that storytelling and companionship are more important to him in that moment than leaving the house.

Question:
“I came here yesterday from my village”, he said. “Why did you come?” I asked. “My mother sent me to you with this letter.” “How is your mother? I have not seen her for a long time. I  hope she is quite well.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
When converting to reported speech with a past reporting verb, verbs shift back one tense (past simple → past perfect, present simple → past simple, present perfect → past perfect), pronouns change, and deictic words change (here → there, yesterday → the day before, this → that).  
Thus: He said that he had come there the day before from his village; I asked why he had come; he said that his mother had sent him to me with that letter; and I asked how his mother was, added that I had not seen her for a long time, and hoped she was quite well.

Once I asked a little girl, “What’s your mother’s name?” “I know my mother’s name but I won’t tell you that. I never tell my mother’s name to anybody whom I don’t know.” I said, “How clever you are!”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The girl wasn’t refusing because she didn’t know the name, but because she won’t tell her mother’s name to people she doesn’t know; since you were a stranger, she rightly refused. This highlights the difference between “knowing” something and “willing to tell” it, and how the phrase “anybody whom I don’t know” means strangers.

“Will you come to my house tomorrow?” I asked the boy. “We can discuss terms and conditions then,” I said. “I shall be very happy to meet you at your house. Thank you so much,” he replied.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
When changing to indirect speech, future/modal verbs shift back (will/shall → would, can → could), time words change (tomorrow → the next day/the following day) and pronouns are adjusted. Hence the sentences become: I asked the boy if he would come to my house the next day; I said that we could discuss terms and conditions then; he replied that he would be very happy to meet me at my house and thanked me.

Question:
“Could 1 help you, Sir?” said the receptionist. The man replied, “Sure, I want to meet the Managing Director of the company.” The receptionist said, “Do you have an appointment?” “Yes, I have,” he said.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The first line should read "Could I help you, Sir?" — the "1" is a typographical error and the subject pronoun "I" is needed to offer help. In reply to "Do you have an appointment?" the natural responses are "Yes, I do." or "Yes, I have an appointment." — "Yes, I have" is incomplete because "have" needs an object (e.g., "an appointment") or you should use the auxiliary "do" with the short answer.

The stranger said to the boy, “Will you tell me the way to the nearest hotel?” “Yes, I will. Do you want a residential one in which can spend the night?” the boy said. “I do not want to stay here, but I want a meal” the stranger replied. The boy said,” Follow me.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The boy first assumed "hotel" meant a place to stay, so he asked if the stranger wanted a residential hotel to spend the night; the stranger clarified he only wanted a meal. Realizing this, the boy offered to lead him to a nearby place to eat, so "Follow me" shows he understood the stranger needed food, not lodging.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer is right because the youth explicitly says, “To earn my bread by the labour of my hands,” so his purpose is stated directly in the dialogue. This shows how to find explicit information in a passage: look for the speaker’s own words to answer questions about their intentions.

Options:

Solution:


Explanation:
The answer is correct because the speaker insists he does remember his mother’s appearance and even names where she lives, which shows a continuing personal connection. The line about “especially in the dark by the fire” gives a specific, vivid image that a child could retain, so the text itself provides the evidence that his memory is real.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: "Exe" is a misspelling; the correct word is "axe." "Careless" should be "carelessly" because an adverb is needed to modify the verb "brought." Use simple past and a correct relative phrase — "the man I bought it from" (or more formally, "the man from whom I bought it") — instead of "the man who I have bought it from."

“Will you go to college today?” the mother said to her son. “No, mother. Our classes are suspended.” “Then go to the market and bring some vegetables,” “Let me be ready and give me money.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct indirect form is: The mother asked her son if he would go to college that day; he replied that their classes were suspended; she then told him to go to the market and bring some vegetables, and he asked her to let him be ready and to give him money. We change present/future verbs and time words for backshifting (”will” → ”would”, ”today” → ”that day”, ”are suspended” → ”were suspended”). Imperatives and requests become reported commands/requests using “told/asked + person + to …” to show who is asked to do what.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer follows from Jerry’s words: he sees his mother “every summer” and she “sends for me,” so they meet only seasonally rather than living together. His remark that she “comes up here from Mannville” and “does not have a job now” explains why visits are intermittent and why she only comes when she can.

“I came here yesterday from my village,” he said. ‘Why did you come?” I asked. “My mother sent me to you with this letter.” “How is your mother? I have not seen her for a long time. I hope she is quite well.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Because the reporting verb is in the past, past-simple verbs shift to past perfect (e.g., "I came..." → "he had come..."), and deictic words change ("here" → "there", "yesterday" → "the previous day", "this" → "that"). Pronouns are adjusted to the reporter’s perspective (e.g., "my" → "his"/"her" or "me" → "him"/"her"). Questions become indirect by using an appropriate reporting verb and changing word order (e.g., "Why did you come?" → "I asked why he had come").

The girl’s reply, “I know my mother’s name but I won’t tell you that,” uses the word “that” to refer to the name, so if taken literally her mother’s name is “That.” The speaker’s praise doesn’t change this; the cleverness is that she hid the name in her sentence.

Question:
“Whose picture is it?” I asked. “A little girl’s of course,” said Grandmother. “Can’t you tell?” “Yes, but do you know the girl?” “Yes, I knew her,” said Granny, “but she was a very wicked girl and I shouldn’t tell you about her.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
I asked grandmother whose picture it was. In reply grandmother told me that of course it was a little girl's picture. Then she asked me whether I couldn't tell about it. I replied in the affirmative but asked her whether she knew the girl. Grandmother replied in the affirmative and added that she had known her. But she further added that she (girl) had been a very wicked girl and she (grandmother) wouldn't tell me about her.

Explanation:
The picture is of a little girl. Grandmother explicitly says "A little girl's of course" in reply to the question, so that directly identifies whose picture it is. Granny’s later remark that she knew the girl and that the girl was wicked only gives additional information about the girl, not about whose picture it is.

He said to me, “I am very sorry to trouble you, but I shall be much obliged if you will kindly lend me your dictionary.” “I shall be very glad to be of service to you, and you are welcome to any of my books that you think of use to you,” said I.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
He told me that he was very sorry to trouble me, but he added that he would be much obliged if I kindly lent him my dictionary. I said that I would be very glad to be of service to him, and added that he was welcome to any of my books that he thought of use to him.

Explanation:
The reported version is correct because direct speech requires backshifting of tenses and change of pronouns: "I am very sorry" becomes "he said (he) was very sorry" (or "he apologized"), "shall be much obliged" and "will kindly lend" become "would be much obliged" and "would kindly lend," and "you" becomes "me"/"him." Similarly, the reply "I shall be very glad..." becomes "I said I would be very glad..." and "you are welcome to any of my books that you think of use to you" becomes "he was welcome to any of my books which he thought would be of use to him." These changes follow the rules of sequence of tenses and appropriate pronoun shifts in reported speech.

Question:
The teacher asked the students if they had heard the name of Aesop. The students respectfully replied that they had not and asked the teacher who he had been. The teacher advised them to listen to his lecture attentively and they would be able to know about him. He also exclaimed with wonder that his fables were very interesting and instructive.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"Have you heard the name of Aesop?" asked the teacher. "No, sir, who was he?" "Listen to my lecture attentively and then you will be able to know about him. How interesting and instructive his fables are!" said the teacher.

Explanation:
The correct answer is right because the teacher’s words — advising them to listen and exclaiming that “his fables were very interesting and instructive” — show both his familiarity with Aesop and his positive opinion of the fables. From these lines we infer the teacher admired Aesop’s stories and wanted the students to learn about him, which explains why that choice best fits the passage.

The witness told the international crimes tribunal that he had suddenly heard a gunshot and gone towards the door. He added that he had seen many Al-Badr men and the members of the Pakistani army on his house premises. The judge asked him if he had recognized some of the Al-Badr men The witness answered that he could recognize one Hamid in his village who had brought the members of the Pakistani army to the village.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"I suddenly heard a gunshot and went towards the door. I saw many Al Badr men and the members of the Pakistani army on my house premises," the witness said to the international crimes tribunal. "Did you recognize some of Al Badr men?" said the judge. "I can recognize one Hamid in my village who brought the members of the Pakistani army to the village," said the witness.

Explanation:
The witness’s identification is likely accepted because he saw the men immediately on his premises after the gunshot and specifically named a person he already knew from the village, giving him a reasonable opportunity to observe and recognize Hamid. The underlying concept is that prior acquaintance plus contemporaneous observation increases the reliability of a witness’s identification for establishing who was present.

Question:
“Why are you crying? Do you have any problem?” asked the passer-by. “I am crying because I have none to look after me,” said the street child. “Are you hungry?” “Yes, I am,” said the boy.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The passer-by asked the street child why he was crying. He also asked the boy if he had any problem. The street child replied that he was crying because he had none to look after him. The passer-by again asked the boy whether he was hungry. The boy replied in the affirmative and said that he was hungry.

Explanation:
The correct answer is that the child is crying because he has no one to look after him — he explicitly says this in reply to the passer-by’s question. To answer such questions, read the speaker’s direct response in the dialogue to identify causes or facts (similarly, he confirms he is hungry when asked).

Question:
“Please give me your English grammar book,” said Fahim. “I cannot give it,” said Arman. “I have to, take it with me in the class.” “I shall return the book before the class starts,” said Fahim. “Take it,” said Arman. “Thanks,” said Fahim.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Fahim requested Arman to give him his (Arman's) English Grammar book. Arman said that he could not give it. He also said that he had to take it with him in the class. Fahim said that he (F) would return the book before the class started. Arman told Fahim to take it. Fahim thanked Arman.

Explanation:
Because the reporting verbs are in the past ("said"), we backshift tenses and change pronouns (e.g., "cannot" → "could not", "have to" → "had to", "shall" → "would"; "me" → "him", "your" → "his"). Imperative sentences become "asked/told + object + to + infinitive" (so "Please give me your..." → "asked him to give him his...", "Take it" → "told him to take it"). Applying these rules gives the correct indirect speech that preserves the original meanings (request, refusal, promise, permission, and thanks).

Question:
“Have you saved something for the future?” said the richman. ” No,” said the cobbler. ” I am happy with the present and think little about tomorrow.” “No, that would not do,” said the richman. “I like to see you above want. Have this money and keep it.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The richman asked the cobbler if he had saved something for future. The cobbler replied in the negative and said that he was happy with the present and thought little about the next day/ tomorrow. The rich man disagreed with the cobbler and said that that would not do. He added that he (rich man) liked to see him (cobbler) above want. Then he told him to have the money and keep it.

Explanation:
The answer is correct because the cobbler openly says he has no savings and lives for today, while the rich man believes in prudence and gives money so the cobbler won’t be in need later. The underlying idea is that being content is admirable, but sensible foresight—saving for future uncertainties—is also necessary.

Question:
“Where do you come from?” I asked him. “From San Carlos,” he said, and smiled. “I was taking care of animals,” “Oh,” I said, not quite understanding. “Yes,” he said, “I stayed, you see, taking care of animals. I was the last one to leave the town of San Carlos.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer is “San Carlos” because he directly replies, “From San Carlos,” when asked where he comes from. His later remark that he “stayed… taking care of animals” and was “the last one to leave the town of San Carlos” simply reinforces that he lived there and remained to tend the animals before leaving.

Question:
“Why are your children crying, my daughter?” said the Caliph. “They have been starving,” said the woman. “Have you none else in the world?” “My husband died some months ago. He left them neither money nor any property. So, they are in great distress. They have to starve sometimes.” “Oh! Let me see, how I can help you,” said the Caliph.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Addressing the woman as his daughter, the Caliph asked her why her children are crying. The woman replied that they had been starving. The Caliph further asked the woman if she had none else in the world. She replied that her husband had died some months before. She added that she had left them neither any money nor any property and so they were in great distress. She also said that they had to starve sometimes. Being touched, the Caliph told her that he might be allowed to see how she could help her.

Explanation:
They are crying because they are starving: the woman explains her husband died months ago and left them no money or property. In other words, the loss of the family’s breadwinner caused poverty and hunger, which is why the children are distressed.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The cobbler answers “No” because he is content with the present and does not think much about the future, so he has not saved anything. The rich man objects and gives him money to ensure he won’t be in want, illustrating that while present happiness is valuable, prudence (saving) helps protect against future need.

I told the rickshaw puller that he had carried me a long way. Then I asked him how much I should pay him. I further asked him if fifty taka would do. He replied that anything was all right.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The rickshaw puller’s reply "anything was all right" shows he had no fixed demand and was willing to accept any reasonable amount, so offering fifty taka would be acceptable. This phrase expresses indifference or agreement to any suggested sum, meaning your proposal of fifty is taken as fine.

Question:
The teacher said to the boy, “Do you think that honesty is the best policy?” The boy said, “Yes, sir, I think so.” “Then, learn to be honest from your boyhood,” said the teacher. “Thank you, sir,” said the boy. “May Allah grant you a long life,” said the teacher to the boy.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
In indirect speech the teacher’s question becomes "asked ... if/whether" and the present tense shifts to past, so "honesty is" becomes "honesty was." The boy’s reply "Yes, sir, I think so" is reported as "he replied that he thought so," changing pronouns and backshifting the tense. Imperative "Learn to be honest" is reported as advice ("told/advised him to learn to be honest"), and the optative "May Allah grant you a long life" is reported as a wish or prayer ("he prayed/wished that Allah might grant him a long life").

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Correct answer: "honesty" — not "honest". The clause "that ___ is the best policy" needs a noun (the name of a quality), so use the noun "honesty"; "honest" is an adjective and cannot function there as the subject/complement.

Question:
“My sons,” said he, “A great treasure lies hidden in the estate. I am about to leave you.” “Where is it hidden?” said the sons. “I am about to tell you.” said the old man. “But you must dig for it.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer is that the treasure is buried somewhere on the estate, because the man explicitly says “A great treasure lies hidden in the estate” and then tells his sons he is “about to leave you,” implying they will inherit the estate where the treasure is. His instruction “you must dig for it” shows the treasure is buried underground, so combining these statements lets us infer its location and how to retrieve it.

Rahim said to Hamid, “How are you? I went to your hostel yesterday, but did not find you. Where did you go?” “I went to the station,” said Hamid, “I had to receive my maternal uncle there.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The answer is correct because in reported speech we change the pronouns and backshift the past tense: "I" becomes "he", "went" becomes "had gone", and "my" becomes "his". So Hamid's words are correctly reported as: Hamid told Rahim that he had gone to the station to receive his maternal uncle.

“Oh, my Lord, please do not kill the child,” said the woman. “Let her have him” the king said. “Now everything is clear to me.” Pointing to the woman, he said to the servant, “Give her the child. She is the mother of the baby.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: The king’s proposal to divide the baby exposed true feelings — the real mother begged to spare the child and even give him up rather than see him killed, showing genuine love and self‑sacrifice, while the other woman did not object. The test works because sincere parental love values the child’s life above possession, so the compassionate woman must be the mother.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: The traveller explicitly says he does not wish to stay overnight but only wants a meal, so the correct interpretation is that he needs food, not lodging. This shows the importance of attending to key phrases ("spend the night" vs "only want a meal") and using clarification to distinguish between different purposes (eating vs staying).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer is that Aesop was a writer of fables. The teacher’s remark “How interesting and instructive his fables are!” directly shows Aesop wrote short stories with moral lessons, so reading the lesson will tell the student who Aesop was and why his fables are noteworthy.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Use "than" for comparisons, not "then", so "never eat more than one thing" is correct. Also the speaker's two replies are separate sentences and should be punctuated as such, and "for" before "tonight" is redundant — correct phrasing: "I'll do better than that," I retorted. "I'll eat nothing for dinner tonight."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: Sheikh Saadi is speaking ironically — he means those rich dishes belong with fine clothes and high rank, not with his poor dress, so he won’t eat them himself. In other words, he’s refusing the luxury out of humility or to show that such food is fit for the well-dressed (the noble), not for him.

“I came here yesterday from my village”, he said. “Why did you come?” I asked. “My mother sent me to you with this letter.” “How is your mother? I have not seen her for a long time. I  hope she is quite well.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: Because the reporting verbs are in the past, verbs and time/place words shift back: simple past [math]came[/math] becomes past perfect [math]had\ come[/math], and “yesterday” → “the day before”, “here” → “there”, “this” → “that”. Pronouns and references change to match the reporter’s perspective (e.g. “my mother” → “his mother”, “me” → “him”, “you” → “me”), and present perfect [math]have\ not\ seen[/math] becomes past perfect [math]had\ not\ seen[/math]; “hope” is usually backshifted to “hoped.” Using these rules gives the correct reported version of the whole exchange.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
She didn’t reveal the name because she has a rule: she never tells her mother’s name to people she doesn’t know, and the asker was a stranger. Calling her “clever” fits because she avoided lying while protecting her mother’s identity by stating that rule instead of giving the name.

Question:
“Will you come to my house tomorrow?” I asked the boy. “We can discuss terms and conditions then,” I said. “I shall be very happy to meet you at your house. Thank you so much,” he replied.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Because the reporting verb is past, future and modal verbs are backshifted ('will/shall' → 'would', 'can' → 'could'), time words change ('tomorrow' → 'the next day') and pronouns shift to match the reporter (the boy's "you/your" → "me/my").  
Thus: "Will you come to my house tomorrow?" → "I asked the boy if he would come to my house the next day."; "We can discuss terms and conditions then," → "I said we could discuss terms and conditions then."; his reply → "He said he would be very happy to meet me at my house and thanked me very much."  
In short, past reporting requires tense backshift, pronoun changes, and adjustment of time/place words.

Explanation:
The correct reply "Yes, I have" is right because it affirms possession of an appointment (short for "Yes, I have an appointment"). It uses the verb "have" in the present simple to answer the question "Do you have an appointment?", so the response is grammatically appropriate.

The stranger said to the boy, “Will you tell me the way to the nearest hotel?” “Yes, I will. Do you want a residential one in which can spend the night?” the boy said. “I do not want to stay here, but I want a meal” the stranger replied. The boy said,” Follow me.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The boy first assumed “hotel” meant a place to sleep, so he asked if the stranger wanted a residential hotel to spend the night. The stranger corrected him, saying he only wanted a meal, so the boy then offered to lead him to a place to eat. This shows the need to clarify ambiguous words like “hotel” which can mean lodging or a restaurant.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The youth’s reply shows he was blind: when he says “I do not see how I can do that” he means he cannot literally see to find and carry the box. The earlier line “I was coming to see you” uses “see” in the sense of “visit,” so the dialogue uses the double meaning of “see” as a clue to his blindness.

সঠিক উত্তরটি তাই, কারণ সরাসরি বাক্য পরোক্ষভাবে রূপান্তর করলে সর্বনাম ও ক্রিয়ার কাল পিছনে টানা হয় এবং প্রশ্ন হলে 'asked' বা 'inquired' ব্যবহার করে if/whether বা উপযুক্ত wh‑word আনতে হয়। উদাহরণ হিসেবে: “May I come in, sir?” → he asked if he might come in; “I have come from Palashpur …” → he said he had come from Palashpur with a letter; “How is he?” → he asked how he was; “He has been suffering for two years” → he said he had been suffering for two years; “May God cure him” → he prayed that God might cure him. মূল ধারণা: টেন্স ব্যাকশিফট, সর্বনামের পরিবর্তন এবং প্রশ্ন/আবেগ বোঝাতে উপযুক্ত রিপোর্টিং ভের্ব ব্যবহার করা।

Question:
“You look a little bit like my mother,” he said, “especially in the dark by the fire,” “But you were only four Jerry, when you came here. You have remembered how she looked all these years?” “My mother lives in Mannville,” he said.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: The speaker’s surprise rests on the fact that Jerry was only four when he left, so he could not have a clear, lasting visual memory of his mother; Jerry’s reply “My mother lives in Mannville” is a simple, factual reassurance rather than a detailed recall. This shows the distinction between vague childhood memory and present knowledge, explaining why he cannot describe her appearance even though someone thinks he resembles her.

Question:
“I’ll pay for it,” he said. “I broke it, I brought the exe down careless,”But no one hits accurately every time, Jerry. Moreover, the fault was in the wood of the handle. I’ll see the man who I have bought it from.” I told him.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: In reported speech tenses are backshifted — "I'll" becomes "he would," "I broke/I brought" become "he had broken/he had brought," and "I have bought" becomes "he had bought." Also adjust pronouns and word forms: use "carelessly" instead of "careless," and prefer "the man from whom he had bought it" (changing the relative pronoun and avoiding a final preposition).

Question:
“Will you go to college today?” the mother said to her son. “No, mother. Our classes are suspended.” “Then go to the market and bring some vegetables,” “Let me be ready and give me money.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
When changing to reported speech we backshift tenses and change time words: “Will you go to college today?” becomes “She asked him whether he would go to college that day” (will → would, today → that day). The answer “No… Our classes are suspended” becomes “He replied that their classes were suspended” (present → past). Imperatives and requests use told/asked + to-infinitive: “Then go to the market and bring some vegetables” → “She told him to go to the market and bring some vegetables,” and “Let me be ready and give me money” → “He asked her to let him be ready and to give him money.”

Explanation:
সঠিক রূপ: শিক্ষক ছাত্রকে জিজ্ঞেস করেছিলেন কেন সে নিয়মিত ক্লাসে যোগ দেয় না এবং বললেন যে যতক্ষণ সে তাঁর নির্দেশমতো ক্লাসে যোগ দেবে না ততক্ষণ ভাল ফল আশা করতে পারে না; ছাত্র ক্ষমা চেয়ে বলল যে সে দুঃখিত যে তিনি (শিক্ষক) কষ্ট পেয়েছেন। কারণ reported speech-এ প্রশ্নের জন্য "asked" ব্যবহার করা হয়, সর্বনাম বদলানো হয় এবং কাল পিছিয়ে দেওয়া হয় (present → past), আর ক্ষমা জানানোর ক্ষেত্রে "I am sorry" বদলে "apologized/said (that) he was sorry" ও "have offended" → "had offended" করা হয়।

Question:
“Can you join me for the meeting on Monday?” she asked. “I'll bring the documents,” I promised. “Please be on time,” she added.

Options:
ক. উক্ত তিনটি বাক্যকে reported speech (আবেদিত বাক্য)‑এ রূপান্তর করো।
খ. প্রথম বাক্যটির প্রশ্নবোধক অংশকে নেগেটিভ (নিষেধমূলক) আকারে লেখো।
গ. "I'll bring the documents" বাক্যটির reported speech‑এ কোন পরিবর্তনগুলো হয়? (টেন্স, সর্বনাম ইত্যাদি সংক্ষেপে উল্লেখ করো)
ঘ. "Please be on time" নির্দেশটিকে অনুগ্রহসূচক reported speech হিসেবে লেখো (উপযুক্ত reporting verb ব্যবহার করে)।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক She asked if I could join her for the meeting on Monday. I promised that I would bring the documents. She added that I should be on time.খ She asked if I could not be late for the meeting on Monday. (নৈগেটিভ ফর্ম: asked if I could not be late / requested that I should not be late.)গ "I'll bring the documents" becomes "I said (or I promised) that I would bring the documents." (Future 'will' → 'would'; pronoun remains 'I' but the reporting verb changes to 'promised'.)ঘ She requested me to be on time. (বা: She requested that I should be on time.)

Explanation:
ক: রেপোর্টেড স্পিচে প্রশ্নবোধক ও বিস্ময়বোধক বাক্য অধিকাংশ ক্ষেত্রে past reporting verb ব্যবহার করলে সময় ও রূপ পরিবর্তিত হয়। প্রথম বাক্যটি প্রশ্নবোধক; তাই 'asked if' ব্যবহার করে সরল অনুবাদ করলাম। দ্বিতীয় বাক্যটি প্রতিশ্রুতি সুত্রে 'promised that' ও 'would' ব্যবহার করেই রূপান্তরিত হল। তৃতীয়টি আদেশ/অনুরোধের মত, তাই 'added that I should be on time' বা 'requested me to be on time' বলা যায়।

খ: প্রশ্নকে নেগেটিভে করার সময় মূল অর্থ বজায় রেখে 'not' বা 'could not / should not' বসাতে হয়। এখানে প্রশ্ন ছিল 'Can you join...'—নেগেটিভ করলে 'Could you not join' বা নির্দেশচিহ্নে 'Could you not be late' ধরনের রূপ পাওয়া যায়; reported speech‑এ এটি 'asked if I could not be late' হিসেবে প্রকাশ করা যেতে পারে।

গ: "I'll bring..."-এ মূলত ভবিষ্যৎ সংকেতক 'will' reporting‑এ past tense‑এ 'would' হয়ে যায়। এছাড়া reporting verb‑এর পরিবর্তন (যেমন 'promised') কথাটির প্রকৃতি নির্দেশ করে—যদি বলা হয় 'I promised that...' তাহলে যে বাক্যটি প্রতিশ্রুতি তা স্পষ্ট হয়। সর্বনাম এখানে 'I' থাকলেও বক্তা ও প্রসঙ্গ অনুযায়ী পরিবর্তন ঘটতে পারে (যদি রিপোর্টো অন্য কেউ হয়)।

ঘ: 'Please be on time' অনুরোধ/নির্দেশ; reported speech‑এ সাধারণত 'requested (someone) to (do something)' বা 'asked (someone) to (do something)' ব্যবহার করা হয়। এক্ষেত্রে 'She requested me to be on time.' বা 'She asked me to be on time.' উপযুক্ত।

Question:
“Have you marked our papers?” the student asked the teacher. “Yes, I'll return them tomorrow,” the teacher replied. “Thank you very much,” the student said.

Options:
ক. উক্ত তিনটি বাক্যকে reported speech‑এ রূপান্তর করো।
খ. প্রথম বাক্যটি যেখানে indirect question হিসেবে লেখা হবে, সেই রূপটি লেখো।
গ. দ্বিতীয় বাক্যের reporting verb পরিবর্তন করলে টেন্সে কি পরিবর্তন হবে? সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে বলো।
ঘ. তৃতীয় বাক্যকে reported speech‑এ লিখে তার reporting verb চিহ্নিত করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The student asked the teacher if she had marked their papers. The teacher replied that she would return them the next day. The student thanked the teacher.খ The student asked whether the teacher had marked their papers. (Indirect question with 'whether' এবং past perfect 'had marked' ব্যবহার করে.)গ যদি 'replied' পরিবর্তে 'said' বা 'promised' ইত্যাদি reporting verb ব্যবহার করা হয়, টেন্স সাধারণত একই রকমই থাকে—যদি reporting verb past tense হয়, 'will' → 'would' (future becomes conditional past)। তাই "I'll return them tomorrow" → "she would return them the next day."ঘ The student thanked the teacher. (Reporting verb: 'thanked' — এটি কৃতজ্ঞতা প্রকাশের reporting verb।)

Explanation:
ক: প্রথম বাক্যটি একটি প্রশ্ন; reported speech‑এ '?' উঠিয়ে 'asked if/whether' দিয়ে রূপান্তর করা হয় এবং সাধারণত present perfect 'have marked' past‑এ 'had marked' হয়ে যায় যদি reporting verb past tense (asked) হয়। দ্বিতীয় বাক্যে ভবিষ্যৎ 'I'll' reported speech‑এ 'would' হয়ে যায় এবং 'tomorrow' শব্দটি প্রসঙ্গে সাপেক্ষে 'the next day' হয়। তৃতীয় বাক্য সরাসরি কৃতজ্ঞতা, তাই reported speech‑এ 'thanked' ব্যবহার করা হয়।

খ: indirect question‑এ 'if' বা 'whether' ব্যবহার করে প্রশ্ন অপসারণ করা হয়; উদাহরণ: "He asked whether I was coming"। এখানে 'Have you marked our papers?' → 'asked whether she had marked their papers.'

গ: reporting verb পরিবর্তনের ফলে টেন্স বদলায় না স্বয়ং; কিন্তু গ্রাম্যাটিক্যাল নিয়ম অনুযায়ী যদি reporting verb past tense হয়, present/future অন্য টেন্সগুলোও backshift হয়। এখানে 'will' backshift করে 'would' হয় এবং 'tomorrow' backshift করে 'the next day' হয়।

ঘ: ধন্যবাদ জানানোর বাক্য reported speech‑এ 'thanked' হয়ে যায়—একটি স্বাভাবিক reporting verb যা কৃতজ্ঞতা প্রকাশ করে।

Question:
“Don't forget to submit the report by five,” he warned. “I won't be late,” she assured. “Also, proofread it twice,” he advised.

Options:
ক. উল্লেখিত সকল বাক্যকে reported speech‑এ রূপান্তর করো।
খ. প্রথম বাক্যটি নির্দেশ/নিষেধের reported speech‑এ কীভাবে লেখা হবে (উপযুক্ত শব্দ ব্যবহার করে)?
গ. তৃতীয় বাক্যে ব্যবহৃত reporting verbটি কী এবং কেন এটি উপযুক্ত?
ঘ. "I won't be late" বাক্যটি reported speech‑এ লিখে বোঝাও টেন্স ও শব্দ পরিবর্তন কী হলো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক He warned her not to forget to submit the report by five. She assured him that she would not be late. He advised her to proofread it twice.খ First sentence as reported command/warning: He warned her not to forget to submit the report by five. ('warned' দিয়ে negative infinitive 'not to forget' ব্যবহার করা হয়.)গ Reporting verb in the third sentence is 'advised'. এটি উপযুক্ত কারণ 'proofread it twice' একটি পরামর্শ/সুপারিশ, এবং 'advise' হল পরামর্শ জানানোর reporting verb; তাই 'advised her to proofread it twice' লেখা যায়।ঘ "I won't be late" → She assured him that she would not be late. ('will' → 'would'; 'won't' → 'would not'—assure ব্যবহার করে প্রতিশ্রুতি/নিশ্চয়তা প্রকাশ করা হয়.)

Explanation:
ক: নেতিবাচক আদেশ/নির্দেশ (Don't forget ...) reported speech‑এ সাধারণত 'warned (someone) not to (do something)' রূপ নেয়। আত্মবিশ্বাস বা প্রতিশ্রুতি জানালে 'assured that' ব্যবহার করা যায়। পরামর্শ বা সুপারিশে 'advised (someone) to (do something)' প্রচলিত।

খ: 'Don't forget to...' একটি negative imperative; reported speech‑এ সেটি 'warned her not to forget to ...' বা 'told her not to forget to ...' ইত্যাদি রূপে প্রকাশিত হয়। 'to'‑infinitive preceded by 'not' ব্যবহার করা হয়।

গ: 'Advise' reporting verbটি পরামর্শের নির্দেশ দেয়—'suggest' বা 'recommend'ও যেতে পারে, কিন্তু 'proofread twice' সরাসরি কর্ম‑পরামর্শ, তাই 'advise' বাস্তবসম্মত।

ঘ: 'will' backshift নিয়ম অনুসারে 'would' হয়; 'won't' এর নেগেশনও backshift করে 'would not' হয়। 'She assured him that she would not be late.' — এভাবে reported speech‑এ অর্থ বজায় থাকে এবং tense/backshift নিয়ম মেনে লেখা হয়।

Question:
“I’ll replace it,” he said. “The pane gave way when I closed the sash hastily. Besides, the fitter fitted it slantwise.” I told him.

Options:
ক. উক্ত বাক্যে ‘I’ll replace it’ কথাটির বক্তা কে? বিশেষভাবে ব্যাখ্যা করুন।
খ. উক্ত সরাসরি কথ্যকে প্রতিবেদনমূলক বার্ত্যভঙ্গে (reported speech) বাংলায় রূপান্তর করুন।
গ. বাক্যটিতে থাকা পঙ্ক্তিবদ্ধ ত্রুটি (যদি থাকে) শনাক্ত করে সংশোধিত লেখাটি দিন — বানান, ব্যাকরণ ও বিরামচিহ্ন ঠিক করে।
ঘ. বক্তার মনোভাব বা উদ্দেশ্য সম্পর্কে যুক্তিসঙ্গত অনুমান করুন এবং কেন আপনি তা মনে করছেন তার ব্যাখ্যা দিন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: 'I’ll replace it' কথাটির বক্তা হলো একই পেশেন্ট ব্যক্তি — কথ্যাংশে ‘he said’ দ্বারা স্পষ্ট যে এটি সে পুরুষের বক্তব্য, অর্থাৎ ক্ষতিটি করেছেন এমন ব্যক্তি নিজেই প্রতিস্থাপন করার প্রতিশ্রুতি দিয়েছেন।

খ উত্তর: তিনি বললেন যে তিনি সেটি প্রতিস্থাপন করবেন এবং যে কাঁচটি ভেঙে গিয়েছিল যখন তিনি দ্রুত সাশ বন্ধ করেছিলেন, তাছাড়া যিনি সেটি লাগিয়েছিলেন তিনি সেটি বিচ্যুতভাবে লাগিয়েছিলেন।

গ উত্তর: সংশোধিত বাক্য (বিরামচিহ্ন ও ভাষাগত শুদ্ধি করে): “I’ll replace it,” he said. “The pane gave way when I closed the sash hastily. Besides, the fitter had fitted it slantwise.” I told him.

(বিকল্পভাবে বাংলা অনুবাদে সুসংহত রূপ: “আমি এটা প্রতিস্থাপন করব,” তিনি বললেন। “আমি যখন তাড়াহুড়ো করে সাশ বন্ধ করেছি তখন কাঁচটি ভেঙে গিয়েছে। উপরন্তু, যিনি লাগিয়েছিলেন তিনি এটা তির্যকভাবে লাগিয়েছিলেন।” আমি তাকে বললাম।)

ঘ উত্তর: অনুমান: বক্তার উদ্দেশ্য হলো নিজে দায় স্বীকার করে ক্ষতিটা মেরামত বা বদল করে ক্ষতিপূরণ দেওয়ার প্রতিশ্রুতি দেওয়া। কারণ: উক্তিতে সে সরাসরি বলেছে ‘I’ll replace it’ — এটি সাধারণত অপরের ক্ষতি পূরণ করার ইচ্ছা বা দায়ভার নেওয়ার সংকেত; তদুপরি, সে মেরামতের কারণ হিসেবে তাড়াহুড়ো করে সাশ বন্ধ করার কথা বলেছে এবং ইনস্টলার (fitter)–এর ত্রুটির কথা উল্লেখ করে পরিস্থিতি ব্যাখ্যা করতে চেয়েছে, ফলে এটি দায় স্বীকার ও সমস্যার সমাধান অফার করার ইঙ্গিত দেয়।

Explanation:
উত্তরগুলোর ব্যাখ্যা:
ক: সরাসরি উদ্ধৃতির পরে 'he said' থাকায় বক্তা স্পষ্ট — পুরুষবাচক 'he' ব্যক্তিই বলেছে।
খ: reported speech-এ সময় ও নির্দেশসূচক শব্দগুলি পরিবর্তন করতে হয় (I’ll → he would/তিনি বললেন যে তিনি…); এছাড়া শর্তমতে ক্রিয়াপদের কাল সামঞ্জস্য রাখতে হয়।
গ: ইংরেজি মূল বাক্যে সামান্য কালানুসারে (fitted → had fitted) এবং ব্যাকরণিক সামঞ্জস্য দরকার; বাংলা অনুবাদে ব্যাক্যগঠন স্বচ্ছ করা হয়েছে।
ঘ: বিস্তৃত প্রেক্ষাপট ও ভাষা থেকে বক্তার মনোবৃত্তি নির্ণয় করা হয়েছে — সরাসরি প্রতিশ্রুতি ও কারণ উদাহরণস্বরূপ দেয়া হয়েছে।

Options:
ক. উক্ত কথায় ‘she’ কার প্রতি কথা বলছে — বক্তা সম্পর্কে সংক্ষিপ্ত পরিচিতি দিন।
খ. এ বাক্যটিকে অনুচ্ছেদ হিসেবে পুনর্বিন্যস্ত করে বাংলা প্রতিবেদনভাষায় রূপান্তর করুন (প্রয়োজনে সময় পরিবর্তন করুন)।
গ. বক্তার ওই বিবৃতি থেকে কোন ধরনের দায়িত্ব গ্রহণ বোঝা যায়? স্পষ্ট করে লিখুন।
ঘ. বাক্যটিতে 'but'–এর ব্যবহার বিশ্লেষণ করুন — এখানে এটি কী পরিবেশন করে?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: 'she' হচ্ছে কথ্যাংশ বলছি এমন নারী — বাক্যের প্রেক্ষিতে এটা ব্যক্তিগত বক্তা, যিনি ট্রে উঠানোর সময় কাপড়ে দাগ লাগার জন্য খরচ দেবেন বলে বলছেন। অন্যান্যের পরিচয় নেই, তাই নির্দিষ্ট নাম নেই; সাধারণভাবে বলা যায় এটি ঘটনাস্থলে উপস্থিত সেই মহিলা যিনি বিষয়টি ঘটিয়েছেন।

খ উত্তর: reported speech (বাংলায়): তিনি বললেন যে তিনি ড্রাই-ক্লিনিংয়ের খরচ দেবেন; তিনি ট্রে তোলার সময় কাপড়ে দাগ পড়েছিল, তবে কফের সেলাই আগেই ঢিলে ছিল। (য়থাযথ কালানুসারে: “She said that she would pay for the dry-cleaning, that it had got a blot when she had lifted the tray, but that the seam at the cuff had already been loose.” — বাংলায় কালানুসারে: তিনি বললেন যে তিনি ড্রাই-ক্লিনিংয়ের খরচ দেবেন; তিনি যখন ট্রে তুলেছিলেন তখন কাপড়ে দাগ পড়েছিল, কিন্তু কফের সেলাই আগেই ঢিলে ছিল।)

গ উত্তর: বক্তা ব্যক্তিগত আর্থিক দায়িত্ব নেবার প্রতিশ্রুতি দিচ্ছেন — তিনি ক্ষতিপূরণ (ড্রাই-ক্লিনিং খরচ) দেবেন। এটি নিজে করা ত্রুটির জন্য ক্ষতিপূরণ দেওয়ার স্বেচ্ছামূলক গ্রহণ, তবে একই সাথে তিনি পরিস্থিতি ব্যাখ্যা করে আংশিক অজ্ঞানতা বা পূর্বাবস্থা (সেলাই ঢিলে ছিল) উদ্ধৃত করেছেন — অর্থাৎ দোষনার কিছু ন্যূনতমতা প্রদর্শন করে নিজেকে পুরোপুরি অভিযুক্ত না করার ইঙ্গিতও দেয়।

ঘ উত্তর: এখানে 'but' ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে বিরোধ বা ব্যাখ্যার সূচক হিসেবে — প্রথমাংশে তিনি ক্ষতি ঘটানোর জন্য দায় নেন ('I’ll pay'), কিন্তু 'but'–এর পর তিনি যুক্তি দেন যে ক্ষতিতে অংশত পূর্বাবস্থা (loose seam) ভূমিকা রেখেছে। অর্থাৎ 'but' অতিরিক্ত প্রেক্ষাপট যোগ করে — একই সময়ে দায় স্বীকার ও পরিস্থিতি ব্যাখ্যা করার কাজ করে।

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা: 
- ক: সরাসরি উদ্ধৃতির লিঙ্গ নির্দেশ করে বক্তা নারী; প্রসঙ্গ থেকে তিনি ঘটনাটির কারণদাতা।
- খ: reported speech-এ কালের পরিবর্তন (will → would, past simple → past perfect ইত্যাদি) এবং conjunction–এর সঙ্গে clause–এর অনুক্রম বজায় রাখা জরুরি।
- গ: ভাষাগত ও নৈতিক দায়িত্ব নিয়ে বক্তার ভূমিকা স্পষ্ট — তিনি ক্ষতিপূরণ দিচ্ছেন যা একটি নৈতিক জবাবদিহি।
- ঘ: 'but' যুক্তি সংঘটিত করে; প্রথম অংশের বিরুদ্ধে বিকল্প বা পরিমিত ব্যাখ্যা প্রদান করে।

Question:
“I’ll cover the repair,” he muttered. “It slipped off the mantelpiece because the wood there had rotted. No one is perfect every time, Tom.” I told him.

Options:
ক. এই কথ্যাংশে ‘No one is perfect every time, Tom.’ — এটির উদ্দেশ্য কী এবং কাকে উদ্দেশ্য করে বলা হয়েছে? বিশ্লেষণ করুন।
খ. পুরো সরাসরি সংলাপটিকে সুষ্পষ্ট প্রতিবেদনশৈলীতে (reported speech) রূপান্তর করে দিন।
গ. বাক্যটিতে ব্যবহৃত 'muttered' শব্দটি কীভাবে কথার স্বর ও মনোভাবকে নির্দেশ করে? ব্যাখ্যা করুন।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: উক্তি 'No one is perfect every time, Tom.' — এখানে বক্তা (তিনি) টমকে বলছেন যাতে টমকে তির্যকভাবে বা নম্রভাবে সরাসরি তিরস্কার বা শান্তধৈর্যের পরামর্শ দেওয়া হয়; উদ্দেশ্য হলো টমকে চোখে আঙুল না তুলে পরিস্থিতি গ্রহণ করার জন্য বোঝানো যে ভুল বা দুর্ঘটনা সবাই করে। অর্থাৎ এটি টমকে শান্ত করতে এবং ঘটনাটিকে ব্যক্তিগতভাবে না নেওয়ার ইঙ্গিত দেয়।

খ উত্তর: reported speech: He muttered that he would cover the repair, adding that it had slipped off the mantelpiece because the wood there had rotted, and that no one was perfect every time, addressing Tom. (বাংলায়: তিনি গুঞ্জর করে বললেন যে তিনি মেরামতের খরচ বহন করবেন; এটি ম্যান্টেলপিস থেকে পিছলে পড়েছিল কারণ সেখানে কাঠ পচে গিয়েছিল, এবং তিনি টমকে বলে যোগ করলেন যে প্রত্যেকবার কেউ নিখুঁত নয়।)

গ উত্তর: 'muttered' শব্দটি নির্দেশ করে যে বক্তার কণ্ঠটি নরম, গুমগুমে বা আচ্ছন্ন — সম্ভবত লজ্জা, অনুশোচনা বা সংবেদনশীলতার কারণে স্পষ্টভাবে উচ্চারণ না করে ফিসফিস করে বা নিঃশব্দে বলছেন। এটি আত্মসম্মানহীনতা বা অনুশোচনার সূচকও হতে পারে; শব্দচয়ন শোনায় যে বক্তব্যটি দৃঢ় কণ্ঠে নয়, বরং হালকাভাবে বা লজ্জার সঙ্গে উচ্চারিত।

ঘ উত্তর: মনুষ্যিক প্রশ্ন (উদাহরণ): 'আপনি কবে লক্ষ্য করেছিলেন যে কাঠটি পচে গেছে?' কারণ: আমার কাছে জানা জরুরি হবে যে এটি পূর্ববারেও সমস্যার লক্ষণ দেখিয়েছিল কি না — যদি আগে থেকেই জানা থাকত, ঘটনার দায় ও প্রতিরোধ সম্পর্কে আলাদা সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়া যেত (উদাহরণস্বরূপ, মালিক বা মেরামতকারীর দায় নির্ণয়)।

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা: 
- ক: সরাসরি সম্বোধন ‘‘Tom’’ থেকে বোঝা যায় বক্তা টমকে উদ্দেশ্য করে কথা বলছেন; বাক্যটির উদ্দেশ্য হলো টমকে শান্ত করা বা ভুলকে সামান্য মনে করার অনুরোধ করা।
- খ: reported speech-এ সময় ও ব্যক্তি সম্পর্কিত পরিবর্তন ঘটাতে হয় এবং সংযোজনী ধারা বজায় রাখতে হবে; উপরন্তু, সরাসরি সম্বোধনকে reported speech-এ স্পষ্টভাবে উল্লেখ করলে বাক্যের অর্থ সংরক্ষিত হয়।
- গ: কথ্যর্ণ 'muttered' মানে নিম্নস্বরে বা ঘেঁষে বলা; এটি বক্তব্যের আবেগগত প্রেক্ষাপট নির্দেশ করে (লজ্জা, অনুশোচনা, ভয় ইত্যাদি)।
- ঘ: প্রাসঙ্গিক প্রশ্ন নির্বাচন ঘটনার দায় নির্ণয় ও ভবিষ্যৎ প্রতিরোধের দিকে নির্দেশ করে; কেন প্রশ্নটি জানতে চাওয়া হলো, তা ইস্যুর গভীরতা ও প্রতিকারের প্রয়োজন বুঝায়।

Question:
A young woman stands at the door of a bakery and speaks with the baker. “Can you help me? I’m looking for work,” she said. “What can you do?” asked the baker. “I can knead dough and sweep,” she replied. “We have only one oven, and many orders,” said the baker. “If you can start at dawn and learn our recipes, you can stay.” “I will try my best,” she answered.

Options:
ক. প্রতিটি উদ্ধৃত বাক্যের বক্তা কে তা নির্ধারণ করো।
খ. কেন সেই তরুণী কাজ করতে চাচ্ছে? পাঠ্যভিত্তিক কারণ two-tailedভাবে বলো।
গ. "I can knead dough and sweep" বাক্যটি পরোক্ষ বক্তৃতায় (reported speech) লিখো।
ঘ. বেকার হয়ত কি তাকে চাকরি দেবে? হ্যাঁ বা না উত্তর দাও এবং পাঠ্যের দুটি কারণ দাও।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: “Can you help me? I’m looking for work,” — তরুণী বলেছে. “What can you do?” — বেকার/বেকারি মালিক বলেছে. “I can knead dough and sweep,” — তরুণী বলেছে. “We have only one oven, and many orders,” — বেকার বলেছে. “If you can start at dawn and learn our recipes, you can stay.” — বেকার বলেছে. “I will try my best,” — তরুণী বলেছে.

খ উত্তর: তরুণী কাজ করতে চাচ্ছে কারণ (1) সে নিজেই সরাসরি বলেছে যে সে "looking for work" — অর্থাৎ জীবিকাভাবে উপার্জন করতে চায়; (2) সে কাজ করার প্রতিশ্রুতি দিয়ে বেকারের সামনে দক্ষতা (dough-kneading, sweeping) উল্লিখিত করেছে, যা দেখায় তার উদ্দেশ্য আর্থিক ও আত্মজীবিকা সংশ্লিষ্ট।

গ উত্তর: Reported speech: She said that she could knead dough and sweep.

ঘ উত্তর: হ্যাঁ, সম্ভবত বেকার তাকে চাকরি দেবেন। কারণ: (1) বেকার বলেছে তাদের একটিই ওভেন আছে এবং অর্ডার অনেক — এটা বোঝায় শ্রমিকের প্রয়োজন আছেন; (2) বেকারই শর্ত দিয়েছেন যে যদি সে ভোরে কাজ শুরু করে এবং রেসিপি শিখতে রাজি থাকে, তবে সে থাকতে পারবে — এটি স্পষ্ট অনুপ্রমাণ যে তিনি নিয়োগ দেওয়ার ইচ্ছা প্রকাশ করেছেন।

Explanation:
ক: নির্দিষ্ট প্রত্যেক উদ্ধৃত বাক্যের বক্তা চিহ্নিত করা সহজ—প্রতিবাদী ডায়ালগ। খ: তরুণীর মোটিভেশন সরাসরি পাঠ্যে আছে; সে কাজ খুঁজছে এবং কাজ করার ইচ্ছা প্রকাশ করেছে। গ: reported speech এ modal 'can' অতীতাকালের 'could' এ বদলে যায় এবং শর্তটি সরাসরি ডিসক্লোজ করা হয়। ঘ: পাঠ্যের তথ্য (অনেক অর্ডার, বেকারের শর্ত) থেকে নিয়োগের সম্ভাবনা ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়েছে।

Question:
A traveling merchant meets a tired cobbler at the market. “Where are you headed?” asked the merchant. “To mend shoes for a festival,” said the cobbler. “I have no money but can repair twelve pairs before sunset,” the cobbler added. “Do you expect payment?” asked the merchant. “Only what customers give,” the cobbler answered. “Come with me; I need repairs for my caravan,” offered the merchant.

Options:
ক. বাক্যটি ছাঁটাই করে সরলভাবে অনুবাদ করো: "I have no money but can repair twelve pairs before sunset."
খ. বণিকের কোন অনাগত চাহিদা/প্রস্তাবটি (implicit offer) এখানে প্রকাশ পাচ্ছে? সংক্ষেপে লেখো।
গ. বণিকের শেষ বাক্যটি ("Come with me; I need repairs for my caravan.") বিনীত অনুরোধের (polite request) আকারে কিভাবে বলা যেতো? লিখো।
ঘ. কোবলার তার প্রতিশ্রুতি পূরণ করতে পারবে কি না—এই প্রস্তাবটি বাস্তবসম্মত কি না? দুইটি সীমাবদ্ধতা উল্লেখ করে বিশ্লেষণ করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: সরল অনুবাদ/প্যারাফ্রেজ: "আমার কাছে কোনো টাকা নেই, কিন্তু সন্ধ্যার আগে আমি বারো জোড়া জুতা মেরামত করতে পারি।"

খ উত্তর: বণিক অসম্প্রতিভুক্তভাবে ব্যাখ্যা করছেন যে সে কোবলারের সেবাগুলি গ্রহণ করে নিজের গাড়ির (caravan) জুতা মেরামত করাতে চাইবে—অর্থাৎ কাজ এবং সম্ভবত ক্ষুদ্র পেমেন্ট বা সৌজন্য স্বরূপ সুবিধা দেওয়ার প্রস্তাব। এটা একটি কাজ দেওয়ার অনুরূপ অফার।

গ উত্তর: Polite request: "Could you come with me? I would appreciate your help repairing shoes for my caravan."

ঘ উত্তর: বাস্তবসম্মত নাও হতে পারে। সীমাবদ্ধতা: (1) সময়সীমা—কোবলার বলেছে সে সন্ধ্যার আগে বারো জোড়া মেরামত করতে পারবে; যদি বণিকের কাজের পরিমাণ বা কাঠামো আলাদা হয় (বিভিন্ন ধরনের বা বেশি কাজ), সব মেরামত করা সম্ভব নাও হতে পারে। (2) বিনিময়কী শর্ত—কোবলার অর্থ চাইছে না কিন্তু "only what customers give" বলেছে, অর্থাৎ পেমেন্ট অনিশ্চিত; বণিক যদি পেমেন্ট না দেয় বা কম দেয়, তবে কোবলারকে তার শ্রমের মূল্য নাও মেলতে পারে।

Explanation:
ক: সঠিক প্যারাফ্রেজে মূল অর্থ বজায় রাখা হয়েছে—টাকা নেই কিন্তু কাজ করতে সক্ষমতা আছে। খ: পাঠ্যে বণিক সরাসরি অনুরোধ করে যে কোবলারের সাহায্য নেবেন; এটি কাজ বা নিয়োগের অনুপ্রাস। গ: বিনীত অনুরোধ প্রদর্শনের নিয়ম — 'could/would' ব্যবহার করে ভদ্রভাবে বলা যায়। ঘ: বাস্তবসম্মত বিশ্লেষণে সময় ও অর্থনৈতিক শর্তকে বিবেচনা করা হয়েছে—দুইটি সাধারণ সীমাবদ্ধতা যা বাস্তবে প্রাসঙ্গিক।

Question:
In a busy market an apprentice speaks to a master tailor. "May I learn your trade? I have no cloth, but I can sew," the apprentice pleaded. "Master tailors seldom teach for free," replied the tailor. "I will teach if you can bring tools and promise punctuality," he added. "I can borrow scissors and arrive early," promised the apprentice.

Options:
ক. টেইলরের কোন শর্ত(গুলি) সে শিখানোর বিনিময়ে রাখেছে? তালিকা করো।
খ. Apprentice-এর প্রতিশ্রুতিটি reported speech-এ কিভাবে লেখা হবে? (একটি সম্পূর্ণ বাক্যে লিখো)
গ. "Seldom" শব্দটি এখানে কিসের ইঙ্গিত দেয়? সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করো।
ঘ. এই সংলাপের উপর ভিত্তি করে একটি ন্যায্য অ্যাপ্রেন্টিসশিপ ব্যবস্থা সাজেস্ট করো—কমপক্ষে তিনটি শর্তসহ।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: টেইলরের শর্তগুলো: (1) শিক্ষার্থীর কাছে টুলস থাকতে হবে (bring tools), (2) শিক্ষার্থী punctual/সময়নিষ্ঠ হতে হবে (promise punctuality).

খ উত্তর: Reported speech: The apprentice promised that he could borrow scissors and would arrive early.

গ উত্তর: "Seldom" মানে খুব কম পরিমাণে বা বিরলভাবে—এখানে বোঝায় যে মাস্টাররা সাধারণত বিনামূল্যে শেখান না; তারা প্রায়ই অর্থ বা অন্য ধরণের বিনিময় প্রত্যাশা করে।

ঘ উত্তর: প্রস্তাবিত ন্যায্য অ্যাপ্রেন্টিসশিপ ব্যবস্থা (৩ টি শর্ত): (1) সরঞ্জাম বিনিময়ে আনা: অ্যাপ্রেন্টিসকে নিজ টুলস বা ধার করা টুলস আনতে হবে—প্রকট ও গ্রহণযোগ্য মানদণ্ড নির্ধারণ করা হবে; (2) সময় ও দায়িত্ব: অ্যাপ্রেন্টিস নির্দিষ্ট সময় সকাল/সন্ধ্যা উপস্থিত থাকবে এবং নির্ধারিত কাজ সম্পন্ন করবে; (3) শেখার/পারিশ্রমিক সমন্বয়: প্রথম X মাসে (উদাহরণস্বরূপ তিন মাস) অ্যাপ্রেন্টিসকে আংশিক বা প্রতিদান স্বল্প পারিশ্রমিক দেওয়া যেতে পারে অথবা কাজ নিয়ে শেখার বিনিময়ে অল্প মজুরি; তার পর দক্ষতা যাচাই করে পূর্ণ মজুরি/চাকরিতে উন্নীত করা হবে।

Explanation:
ক: টেক্সটে টেইলরের শর্ত স্পষ্টভাবে দেয়া আছে — টুলস ও সময়নিষ্ঠতা। খ: reported speech-এ ভবিষ্যৎ/তাৎক্ষণিক প্রতিশ্রুতি 'would' বা 'could' দিয়ে উপস্থাপিত হয়; তাই উপরের বাক্যটি পর্যাপ্ত। গ: 'seldom' শব্দের সাধারণ অভিধা ও প্রাসঙ্গিক ব্যাখ্যা দেয়া হয়েছে। ঘ: একটি ন্যায্য অ্যাপ্রেন্টিসশিপ প্রস্তাব করতে বাস্তবিক শর্ত (টুলস, সময়, পারিশ্রমিক/শিক্ষার বিনিময়) অন্তর্ভুক্ত করা হয়েছে, যা সংলাপে আলোচিত বিষয়গুলোর সাথে সঙ্গতিপূর্ণ।

Question:
“Is that suitcase yours?” asked the porter. “Yes,” she replied. He peered inside. “Just clothes?” he asked. She hesitated and then whispered, “My wedding gown.” The porter rubbed his chin. “I can give you twenty,” he said. She clutched the handle tighter.

Options:
ক. এই সংলাপে প্রশ্নকারীর ভূমিকা কী?
খ. মেয়েটি ব্যাগের মধ্যে কী রেখেছে?
গ. পোর্টারের ‘I can give you twenty’ কথাটির সম্ভাব্য অর্থ কী এবং সে কেন এমন বললো?
ঘ. এই সংলাপের প্রধান বিষয়ের বা থিমের ব্যাখ্যা করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: পোর্টার; তিনি যাত্রী/পোর্টারের ভূমিকা পালন করছেন, ব্যাগটি পরীক্ষা করে এবং দাম বা বিনিময় সম্পর্কে প্রস্তাব করছেন।

খ উত্তর: তার বিয়ের পোশাক/বিয়ের গাউন; মেয়েটি নীরবে জানিয়েছে যে ব্যাগে তার বিয়ের গাউন আছে।

গ উত্তর: পোর্টারের কথা বোঝায় যে তিনি মেয়েটিকে গাউনের জন্য বিশ ডলার দিতে রাজি আছেন — সম্ভবত তা তাকে কিনে নেবার বা অস্থায়ীভাবে বিনিময়ে দিতে বলার প্রস্তাব; কারণ পোর্টার মনে করে মেয়েটি অর্থে সংকটগ্রস্ত এবং ততক্ষণে তৎপর বাজার মূল্য দেওয়ার প্রস্তাব দিচ্ছে।

ঘ উত্তর: থিম: আত্ম-ত্যাগ ও আর্থিক উদ্বেগ/বস্তুর মুল্য বনাম স্মৃতির মূল্য; সংলাপটি দেখায় একজন মানুষের ব্যক্তিগত, আবেগগত মূল্যবান জিনিসকে আর্থিক চাহিদার কারণে বিক্রির সম্ভাবনা এবং সমাজে দরিদ্রতা কীভাবে ব্যক্তিগত স্মৃতি বা সম্মানকে বিপন্ন করে।

Explanation:
ক: সংলাপ থেকে পরিষ্কার যে যিনি প্রশ্ন করছেন তিনি পোর্টারের ভূমিকা পালন করছেন — তিনি ব্যাগ খোলে বা খোলার কথা বলেন এবং কেনাবেচার প্রস্তাব দেন।

খ: মেয়েটি সরাসরি বলেছে যে "My wedding gown" ব্যাগের মধ্যে আছে; তাই সেটিই সঠিক।

গ: 'I can give you twenty' কথাটি সরাসরি অর্থে অর্থ প্রদানের প্রস্তাব; প্রেক্ষাপট থেকে বোঝা যায় যে পোর্টার মেয়েটির আর্থিক চাপ বুঝে কম মূল্যেও কেনার ইচ্ছা দেখাচ্ছে বা দ্রুত নগদ দেওয়ার প্রস্তাব দিচ্ছে। এছাড়া এটি ক্ষমতা-বৈষম্যও নির্দেশ করে — ক্রেতা হাতে নগদ আছে, বিবেকসংকট থাকা সত্ত্বেও দরদাম চালানো হচ্ছে।

ঘ: সংলাপের মর্ম হলো ব্যাক্তিগত মূল্য (বিয়ের গাউন — স্মৃতি, মর্যাদা) বনাম বাস্তবিক আর্থিক চাহিদা; লেখক ছোট বাক্য ও সংলাপে এই দ্বন্দ্ব তুলে ধরেছেন।

Question:
“You want to sell that old pocket watch?” the pawnbroker asked. The man fumbled it out of his vest and held it up to the light. “It was my father's,” he murmured. The pawnbroker clicked his tongue. “For this, I can pay fifteen,” he said. The man glanced toward the street, then slowly shook his head.

Options:
ক. পকেট ওয়াচটি কার মালিকানার বর্ণনা কী?
খ. পব্ব্রোকার কত টাকা প্রস্তাব করল এবং কীভাবে এটা জানাতে পারে যে সে কি ধরনের ব্যবসা করে?
গ. পুরুষটি কেন প্রস্তাবে রাজি না হতে পারে — অন্তত দুটি সম্ভাব্য কারণ বলুন।
ঘ. এই দৃশ্য থেকে পাঠকের কোন অনুভূতি বা ভাব তৈরি হয়? সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: পকেট ওয়াচটি সেই পুরুষটির বাবার ছিল — তিনি বলেন “It was my father's,” যা স্পষ্টভাবে মালিকানার সূত্র দেয়।

খ উত্তর: পব্ব্রোকার পনেরো ডলার (fifteen) প্রস্তাব করেছে; এটি ইঙ্গিত করে যে সে ন্যায়সঙ্গত পেশাদার ক্রেতা নয় বরং লাভবান পঠিবপাঠি/pawnshop ব্যবসায়ী—সস্তায় পুরনো জিনিস কিনে পরে আবার বিক্রি করে মুনাফা অর্জন করে।

গ উত্তর: (১) আবেগগত কারণে — এটি বাবার স্মারে ছিল; তাই তিনি বিক্রি করতে চাইছেন না। (২) তিনি মনে করেন প্রস্তাবকৃত মূল্য যথেষ্ট নাও হতে পারে — জিনিসটির ন্যায্য মূল্য তার মতে বেশি হতে পারে। এছাড়া (৩) সামাজিক লজ্জা বা অহংকার—জরুরি অবস্থা ছাড়া নিকৃষ্ট বিক্রয় করা অনিচ্ছাকৃত হতে পারে।

ঘ উত্তর: দৃশ্যটি পাঠককে সহানুভূতিশীল ও ক্লান্ত অনুভূতি দিতে পারে — একদিকে আর্থিক চাপে থাকা, অন্যদিকে আত্মীয় স্মৃতির মূল্য রক্ষার চেষ্টা; এগুলো মিশে একটি মর্মস্পর্শী ও কাব্যিক সুর তৈরি করে।

Explanation:
ক: প্রত্যক্ষ উদ্ধৃতি থেকে মালিকানার সূত্র পাওয়া যায়।

খ: 'For this, I can pay fifteen' সরাসরি দর প্রদর্শন করে। এই ধরনের সংলাপ সাধারণত pawnshop বা কৃত্রিমভাবে কম মুল্য দেয় এমন ব্যবসায়ীর কথার মতো শোনায়।

গ: বিক্রির অস্বীকারের পেছনে আবেগ ও অর্থ—দুইটি প্রধান কারণ। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, ব্যক্তি যদি বাবার স্মৃতি সংরক্ষণ করতে চায় বা মূল্য অনুপযুক্ত মনে করেন, তখন তিনি রাজি হবেন না।

ঘ: লেখনী ও সংলাপের সংক্ষিপ্ততা ও বিষয়বস্তুর সংমিশ্রণে ক্রমশ পাঠকের মনোব্রহ্ম শক্ত হয় — সহানুভূতি, অনুশোচনা, আর্থিক কষ্টের উপলব্ধি তৈরি হয়।

Question:
“Will you take my locket?” she asked the stall-owner. “I won't buy family things,” he replied, but she persisted, holding out a faded gold chain. “I need the fare home.” He hesitated, then offered ten. She counted the coins and sighed, tucking the empty chain into her pocket.

Options:
ক. মেয়েটি কেন লকেট বিক্রি করতে চাইছে?
খ. স্টল-ওনার প্রথম প্রতিক্রিয়া কী এবং তার মানে কী বোঝায়?
গ. তিনি শেষ পর্যন্ত কত টাকা পেল এবং সে কী করলো?
ঘ. এই ঘটনাটি সমাজকাঠামো বা চরিত্রের বৈশিষ্ট্য সম্পর্কে কী মন্তব্য করে? দুটি প্রধান পর্যবেক্ষণ দিন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: সে লকেট বিক্রি করছে কারণ সে ‘fare home’ অর্থাৎ বাড়ি ফেরার ভাড়া প্রয়োজন — অর্থাৎ তা আর্থিক জরুরী চাহিদার ফল।

খ উত্তর: স্টল-ওনার প্রথমে বলেছে “I won't buy family things” — তার মানে সে ব্যক্তিগত বা আবেগনির্ভর জিনিস কিনতে রাজি নয় (বা এতে ঝুঁকি নেই), সম্ভবত নৈতিক কারণে কিম্বা ব্যবসায়িক কারণে সে এধরনের জিনিস গ্রহণ করতে অনিচ্ছুক।

গ উত্তর: শেষ পর্যন্ত তিনি দশ ডলার/কয়েন পেয়েছিলেন (ten); তিনি কয়েন গুনে নিঃশ্বাস ফেললেন এবং খালি চেইনটি তার পকেটে রাখলেন — অর্থাৎ বিক্রি করে নৈপুণ্য ও দুশ্চিন্তার মিশ্র অনুভূতি নিয়ে বাড়ি যাওয়ার প্রস্তুতি।

ঘ উত্তর: (১) অর্থনৈতিক অসমতা: দরিদ্রতা মানুষকে ব্যক্তিগত মূল্যবহু স্মৃতি বিক্রি করতে বাধ্য করে। (২) মানবীয় সহানুভূতি বনাম ব্যবসায়িক নিয়ম: স্টল-ওনার দারিদ্র্য বুঝলেও ব্যবসায়িক নীতি/আবেগগত সীমা বজায় রাখে; একই সাথে বিক্রেতার আচরণে গৌরব ও বিবেকের সংঘর্ষ দেখা যায়।

Explanation:
ক: গল্পের সরাসরি বক্তব্য অনুযায়ী লকেট বিক্রি করার কারণ হল ভ্রমণের ভাড়া দরকার — এটি আর্থিক সংকটের ক্লাসিক উদাহরণ।

খ: স্টল-ওনারের প্রথম প্রতিক্রিয়া থেকে বোঝা যায় তিনি পারিবারিক বা আবেগ-সংযুক্ত জিনিসে লেনদেন করতে অনিচ্ছুক — কারণ তা ব্যক্তিগত এবং মূল্যায়নে অসুবিধা হতে পারে বা নীতিগত সমস্যা থাকতেই পারে।

গ: লেখায় ‘then offered ten. She counted the coins’ অংশটি স্পষ্টভাবে দশ পাওয়ার ইঙ্গিত দেয়; পরে সে খালি চেইন পকেটে রাখে — বিক্রয় শেষে তার মানসিক অবস্থা ও প্রতিক্রিয়াও বর্ণিত।

ঘ: এই ধরনের ছোট দৃশ্যগুলো সামাজিক স্তরে অর্থনৈতিক বৈষম্য, মানবিকতা বনাম ব্যবসাবোধ, এবং ব্যক্তিগত স্মৃতি ও আর্থিক চাহিদার সংঘাত তুলে ধরে।

Question:
“He says he will be back when the harvest is over,” she told me, folding the faded scarf into a neat square. “He promised the same thing last year. He writes once in a while — the ink runs when it rains.”

I watched her fingers smooth the cloth. The kitchen clock ticked louder than the cricket outside. “Why do you let him go?” I wanted to ask, but the words caught behind my teeth.

Options:
ক. এই অনুচ্ছেদের প্রধান বক্তা কারা এবং তাদের সম্পর্ক কী?
খ. পুরুষটি কেন বাইরে যাচ্ছে বলে পাঠকের অনুমান করা যায়? প্রমান দিন।
গ. বর্ণনাকারীর মনোভাব কেমন? অনুচ্ছেদ থেকে একটি পংক্তি তুলে ধরে ব্যাখ্যা করুন।
ঘ. এই অনুচ্ছেদে কোন থিম বা ভাব প্রকাশ পেয়েছে? সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে ব্যাখ্যা করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: প্রধান বক্তা হলো কথক (বর্ণনাকারী) এবং সেই মহিলা — সম্ভবত নারীটি তার স্ত্রী বা প্রিয়জন। কথক মহিলার কাছে কথা শুনে তত্ত্বাবধান করছে; তাদের সম্পর্ক নিবিড় ও পরষ্পর পরিচিততার ইঙ্গিত দেয়।

খ উত্তর: পুরুষটি সম্ভবত কৃষি বা মৌসুমি কাজের জন্য বাইরে যাচ্ছে অথবা অনন্য কর্মের জন্য অনিয়মিতভাবে গ্রাম/শহর ছেড়ে যায়; এটি অনুমান করা যায় কারণ তিনি "harvest" (ফসল কাটা) সম্পর্কে কথা বলেছেন এবং ফিরে আসার সময় ফসলের শেষে বলা হয়েছে। এছাড়া তিনি "writes once in a while" বলে দূরে থেকে মঞ্জুরি দেয়ার ইঙ্গিত আছে।

গ উত্তর: বর্ণনাকারীর মনোভাব উদ্বিগ্ন ও সতর্ক; তিনি মহিলা সম্পর্কে সহানুভূতিশীল এবং অস্বস্তিকর প্রশ্ন জিজ্ঞাসা করতে চাইলেও হিমশিম খাচ্ছেন। এটির প্রমাণ: "I wanted to ask, but the words caught behind my teeth." এই লাইনটি ব্যাখ্যা করে যে তিনি প্রশ্ন করতে চান, কিন্তু ভয় বা অনভিপ্রেত কারণে থেমে যাচ্ছেন।

ঘ উত্তর: প্রধান থিম হলো অনিশ্চয়তা ও অপেক্ষা — দেখা যায় সম্পর্কের দূরত্ব, প্রতিশ্রুতি ও দীর্ঘ অপেক্ষার অনুভূতি। পাশাপাশি এটি প্রত্যাশা ও নির্ভরতার বিষয়ও স্পর্শ করে (মিলিত প্রতিশ্রুতি, চিঠি)।

Explanation:
ক: সংলাপ ও বর্ণনার ধাঁচ থেকে বোঝা যায় কথক একজন তৃতীয় ব্যক্তি যে মহিলার কথাটি শুনছে; সে মহিলাকে পরিচিত ও অন্তরঙ্গভাবে বর্ণনা করে তাই তাদের সম্পর্ক ঘনিষ্ঠ।

খ: "He will be back when the harvest is over" ও "He writes once in a while"—এই উক্তিগুলো ভ্রমণ/অস্থায়ী কাজে যাওয়ার ইঙ্গিত দেয়; বিশেষত "harvest" শব্দটি মৌসুমি কাজের সংযোগ দেয়।

গ: বর্ণনাকারীর অন্তর্দ্বন্দ্ব এবং নীরবতার বোধ উল্লেখযোগ্য; বাক্যগঠন ও উপনীত চিত্র ("words caught behind my teeth") উদ্বেগ ও সহানুভূতির প্রমাণ দেয়।

ঘ: উপন্যাসী সংলাপ ও দৈনন্দিন জীবনের নিখুঁত বিবরণ মিশে থিমটিকে গঠন করে: অপেক্ষা, প্রতিশ্রুতি, নির্ভরতা।

Question:
She hummed the same lullaby as she swept the porch, though the house had been empty for months. Neighbors said she used to teach children down by the river; now she counted the days on a calendar with trembling fingers.

Options:
ক. পাঠ্যাংশে 'lullaby' শব্দটির সাধারণ অর্থ কী? এখানে এটি কীভাবে আবেগগতভাবে কাজ করে?
খ. প্রতিবেশীদের বর্ণনা থেকে ওই মহিলার অতীত সম্পর্কে কী বোঝা যায়? সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা করুন।
গ. ক্যালেন্ডার গোনা এবং "house had been empty for months"—এই দুইটি বিবরণ একসঙ্গে কি অনুভব সৃষ্টি করে? ব্যাখ্যা করুন।
ঘ. এই ছোট অনুচ্ছেদে ব্যবহৃত কোন সাহিত্যিক উপাদানটি (literary device) সবচেয়ে শক্তভাবে কাজ করছে? উদাহরণসহ বোঝান।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: 'Lullaby' সাধারণত শিশুকে শীতল বা ঘুম পাড়ানোর জন্য গাওয়া শান্ত গান। এখানে এটি আবেগগতভাবে স্মৃতিচারণ ও সান্ত্বনার প্রতীক হিসেবে কাজ করে—যা মহিলার অতীত এবং তার একাকীত্বের বিরুদ্ধে একটি কোমল সুর তুলে ধরে।

খ উত্তর: প্রতিবেশীদের কথায় বোঝা যায় সে আগে একটি শিক্ষক ছিল—শিশুদের কাছে পড়াতো, সম্ভবত নদীর ধারে বসবাস বা কাজ করতো। এটি তার পরিচয়ের গুরুত্ব এবং তার জীবনে এখন যে শূন্যতা তা নির্দেশ করে।

গ উত্তর: ক্যালেন্ডার গোনা ও ঘরের শূন্যতার মিলিত বিবরণ একাকীত্ব, অপেক্ষা ও সময়ের ধীরে ধীরে ক্ষয়–ক্ষতির অনুভব সৃষ্টি করে। ক্যালেন্ডার গোনা মানে কাউকে প্রত্যাশা করা বা সময় মাপা; ঘরের শূন্যতা মানে অনুপস্থিতি—এই কম্বিনেশন মন্থর বেদনা ও প্রত্যাশার সুর তোলে।

ঘ উত্তর: সবচেয়ে শক্তিশালী সাহিত্যিক উপাদান হলো ইমেজারি (imagery) এবং প্রতীক (symbolism)। উদাহরণ: ‘‘she hummed the same lullaby’’ ও ‘‘counted the days on a calendar with trembling fingers’’—এই চিত্রগুলো শোনার ও দৃশ্যমান অনুভূতি তৈরি করে এবং lullaby ও calendar প্রতীকি কাজে ব্যবহার হয়েছে (সান্ত্বনা ও সময়/অপেক্ষার প্রতীক)।

Explanation:
ক: শব্দার্থ ও প্রাসঙ্গিক প্রভাবের বিশ্লেষণ—lullaby শব্দটি সচরাচর প্রশমক; এখানে সেটি স্মৃতি ও নস্টালজিয়ার সঙ্গে যুক্ত।

খ: সরাসরি বার্তায় বলা আছে তিনি 'used to teach'—এখানে অতীত ক্রিয়াপদ নির্দেশ করে তার পেশা ও সামাজিক ভূমিকা।

গ: এই দুই উপাদান মিলে কাহিনীর আবহ তৈরি করে—সময় মাপা ও অনুপস্থিতির ঘোর; পাঠক অনুভব করতে পারে একপ্রকার স্থবির দুঃখ।

ঘ: ইমেজারি ও প্রতীক ব্যবহার পাঠককে সরাসরি অনুভব করায়—সংক্ষিপ্ত অনুচ্ছেদে এই উপাদানগুলি বিষয়টিকে গভীর করে তোলে।

Question:
The boy unfolded the letter with dirty fingers. The single line read, 'Don't come back until the frost is gone.' He pressed the paper to his chest as if it were a talisman and walked toward the lane where the fields met the sky.

Options:
ক. চিঠিতে যে বার্তাটি আছে, তা ভিত্তি করে লেখককে/লিখতাকে শনাক্ত করার কোন ইঙ্গিত মেলে? সংক্ষিপ্ত কারণসহ বলুন।
খ. ‘pressed the paper to his chest as if it were a talisman’ — এই রূপকটির মানে কী এবং এটি ছেলে সম্পর্কে কী বলছে?
গ. এই দৃশ্য থেকে ছেলে কেমন মানসিক অবস্থায় আছে বলে আপনি ধারণা করবেন? তিনটি বর্ণনা দিন।
ঘ. এই অনুচ্ছেদ থেকে ভবিষ্যতে কী ঘটনা ঘটতে পারে তা সম্পর্কে একটি যুক্তিসঙ্গত পূর্বাভাস দিন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: চিঠির সারল্য ('Don't come back until the frost is gone') ইঙ্গিত করে যে লেখক সম্ভবত পরিবার থেকে বড় কেউ বা কোনো রক্ষাকারী—যিনি আবহাওয়া/ঝুঁকির কথা মাথায় রেখে কাউকে নিরাপদ থাকতে বলছেন। আরো প্রাসঙ্গিকভাবে এটি একজন অভিভাবক বা গ্রামীর কাছের ব্যক্তি হতে পারে। কারণ: নির্দেশটি বাধ্যতামূলক ও রক্ষামূলক স্বরে লেখা।

খ উত্তর: এখানে 'talisman' রূপক অর্থে যে কাগজকে ছেলেটি বুকের কাছে ধরে রাখে, তা তার জন্য সান্ত্বনা ও নিরাপত্তার প্রতীক; সে চিঠিটিকে ভাগ্য রক্ষাকারী বা মানসিক আশ্রয় হিসেবে দেখে। এটি দেখায় যে ছেলেটি আবেগগতভাবে অসম্পূর্ণ, আশা ও ভরসা খুঁজছে এবং চিঠিটি তার মানসিক সম্বল।

গ উত্তর: ছেলে সম্ভবত ভয়াহত, আশাবান এবং প্রবলভাবে অপেক্ষার মধ্যে—বিশেশভাবে: (1) আশঙ্কিত/সংকুচিত (frost–related danger নিয়ে সতর্ক), (2) আশাবাদী/নির্ভর (চিঠিটিকে তাবিজের মতো ধরে রাখা), (3) সংবেদনশীল/একাগ্র (ক্ষেতের দিকে হাঁটার মাধ্যমে তিনি কোনো সিদ্ধান্ত নেবার চেষ্টা করছে)।

ঘ উত্তর: যুক্তিসঙ্গত পূর্বাভাস: ছেলে হয়তো মাঠে গিয়ে কোনো প্রহরায়/পর্যবেক্ষণে দেখা বা খোঁজ করবে অথবা পরিবারের অনুপস্থিতির কারণ বুঝতে কোনো বড়ফাঁস ঘটবে—উদাহরণস্বরূপ, সে frost শেষ হওয়ার আগেই অপরাগত পরিস্থিতি (অগ্নিকাণ্ড, অসুস্থতা বা পুনর্মিলন) দেখে ফেলতে পারে। চিঠির সতর্কতা থাকা সত্ত্বেও ছেলে সক্রিয়ভাবে কিছু সম্পর্কে জানতে যাবে।

Explanation:
ক: নির্দেশমূলক লাইন প্রায়শই অভিভাবকীয় সুর ধারণ করে; এটি ঝুঁকি সম্পর্কে সতর্ক করার ইঙ্গিত দেয়।

খ: 'talisman' রূপক অনুচ্ছেদের আবেগগত কেন্দ্র — একটি সাধারণ কাগজ এখানে ছেলের জন্য মানসিক সুরক্ষার বস্তু।

গ: পাঠ্য থেকে ছেলেটির আচরণ (কাদামাখা হাত, কাগজ বুকের কাছে ধরা, মাঠের দিকে যাওয়া) মিলিয়ে তার মানসিক অবস্থার তিনটি উপস্থাপন উপযুক্ত।

ঘ: চিত্রিত সংকট-সাময়িক কাহিনী কাঠামো অনুযায়ী, এমন পরবর্তী ঘটনা সম্ভাব্য—সন্তানের অনুসন্ধান, কোন বিপদের মুখোমুখি হওয়া, অথবা পারিবারিক পুনর্মিলন।

Question:
"I reached here this morning from my town," he said. "What brought you?" I asked. "My father asked me to deliver this parcel to you." "How is your father? I haven't heard from him lately. I hope he is well."

Options:
ক. এখানে 'My father asked me to deliver this parcel to you.' কে কে পাঠিয়েছিল—প্রশ্নের সরাসরি উত্তর লেখো।
খ. উক্ত বাক্যটিকে reported speech-এ (আবেগ/কথোপকথন প্রতিবেদন) রূপান্তর করো (সঠিক কাল পরিবর্তনসহ)।
গ. 'I haven't heard from him lately.' বাক্যে কোন কাল ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে এবং কেন তা উপযুক্ত হয়েছে তা ব্যাখ্যা করো।
ঘ. "I hope he is well." বাক্যটি 'may' ব্যবহার করে শুভকামনার রূপে পরিবর্তন করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: তিনি বলেছে যে তার পিতা তাকে প্যাকেটটি ডেলিভারি করতে পাঠিয়েছেন; সুতরাং প্যাকেট পাঠিয়েছেন: তার পিতা।

খ উত্তর: He said that his father had asked him to deliver that parcel to me.  (কারণ মূল কথ্য 'asked' past tense, তাই reported speech-এ backshift করে past perfect 'had asked' ব্যবহার করা হয়। 'this' ও 'you' যথাযথ পরিবর্তন করে 'that' ও 'me' করা হয়েছে।)

গ উত্তর: Present perfect tense ('have/has + past participle') ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে: 'haven't heard'। এটি অতীত থেকে বর্তমান পর্যন্ত একটি অনির্দিষ্ট সময়সীমার অভিজ্ঞতা বা ঘটনাবলীর ধারাবাহিকতা দেখায়—লেটলি (lately) শব্দটি সেই সময়সীমা ইঙ্গিত করে; তাই present perfect উপযুক্ত।

ঘ উত্তর: May he be well.  বা  I hope he may be well.  (শুভকামনা বা ইচ্ছা প্রকাশে 'may' ব্যবহার করে বাক্যটিকে আনুষ্ঠানিকভাবে রূপান্তর করা যায়।)

Explanation:
ক: কথ্য থেকে সরাসরি তথ্য নেওয়ার ক্ষেত্রে 'who sent it?'—উত্তরটি স্পষ্ট: তার পিতা।

খ: reported speech-এ টাইম ও কনটেক্সট অনুযায়ী কালের পেছনে সরানো (backshift) দরকার; মূল ক্ষেত্রে 'asked' ছিল past, তাই reported speech-এ সেটা past perfect ('had asked') হয়; 'this parcel' ও 'you' যথাক্রমে 'that parcel' ও 'me' এ পরিবর্তিত হয়েছে কারণ বক্তব্যটি তৃতীয় পক্ষ থেকে বলা হচ্ছে।

গ: 'I haven't heard from him lately' বলে বোঝায় যে গত কিছু সময় থেকেই তার থেকে খবর পাওয়া যাচ্ছেনা — এমন ধরনের অনির্দিষ্ট অতীত-বর্তমান সংযোগ present perfect দ্বারা ভালোভাবে প্রকাশ করা হয়। অতএব present perfect উপযুক্ত।

ঘ: 'may' ব্যবহার করে ইচ্ছা বা শুভকামনা প্রকাশ করা হয়; সরাসরি 'I hope he is well' কে আনুষ্ঠানিকভাবে 'May he be well' বা 'I hope he may be well' বলা যেতে পারে।

Question:
"I came yesterday from my village," she said. "Why did you leave so soon?" I asked. "My aunt wrote to me and sent this little bundle with instructions for you." "How is your aunt doing? I haven't met her since last month. I hope she is keeping well."

Options:
ক. বক্ত্রী কোথা থেকে এসেছে এবং কখন—সংক্ষেপে লেখো।
খ. "My aunt wrote to me and sent this little bundle with instructions for you." বাক্যটি reported speech-এ রূপান্তর করো।
গ. "I haven't met her since last month." বাক্যটিতে 'since' কেন ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে তা বোঝাও।
ঘ. "I hope she is keeping well." বাক্যটির এক বিকল্প, যা অভিব্যক্তি কম আনুষ্ঠানিক করে, লিখো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: তিনি গতকাল (yesterday) তার গ্রাম (village) থেকে এসেছেন।

খ উত্তর: She said that her aunt had written to her and had sent that little bundle with instructions for me.  (দুইটি ক্রিয়াকে reported speech-এ backshift করা হয়েছে: 'wrote' → 'had written', 'sent' → 'had sent'; 'this' → 'that', 'you' → 'me'.)

গ উত্তর: 'Since' ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে নির্দিষ্ট একটি শুরুকারী সময় (last month) থেকে বর্তমানে পর্যন্ত বৈধ/চলমান অবস্থা বা ক্রিয়ার অবিরত সময়কাল নির্দেশ করার জন্য। 'Since last month' মানে তিনি গত মাস থেকে তাকে দেখা করেননি—এটি present perfect (haven't met)–এর সঙ্গে স্বাভাবিকভাবে আসে।

ঘ উত্তর: I hope she is well.  বা  I hope she's doing well.  (এই বিকল্পগুলো একটু বেশি অনানুষ্ঠানিক ও কথ্য।)

Explanation:
ক: বাক্যটিতে স্পষ্টভাবে বলা আছে 'I came yesterday from my village'—সেখানে কবে ও কোথা থেকে এসেছেন তা বোঝায়।

খ: reported speech-এ সময়গত ক্রিয়া সাধারণত এক ধাপ পেছনে চলে (backshift) কারণ বক্তৃতাটি অতীত সময়ে বর্ণিত; তাই 'wrote' এবং 'sent' দুটোকেই past perfect-এ রূপান্তর করা হয়। এছাড়া দৃষ্টিপথ পরিবর্তনে 'this' ও 'you' সংশ্লিষ্ট পরিবর্তিত রূপে আসে।

গ: 'since' ব্যবহার করে নির্দিষ্ট একটি সূচনামূলক পয়েন্ট থেকে (last month) এখন পর্যন্ত অনুপস্থিতি বোঝানো হয়; present perfect tense-এর সাথে 'since' কম্বিনেশন সাধারণ এবং উপযুক্ত।

ঘ: 'I hope she is keeping well' এর সহজ, কম আনুষ্ঠানিক বিকল্পগুলি 'I hope she is well' বা 'I hope she's doing well'—এগুলি কথ্য-ভাষায় বেশি ব্যবহৃত।

Question:
"I came by train from my hometown this afternoon," he told us. "Why were you sent here?" I asked. "My teacher sent me with this note to inform you about tomorrow's meeting." "Is your teacher well? I last saw him a long time ago. I hope he is in good health."

Options:
ক. তিনি কীভাবে এবং কখন এসেছে—একটি বাক্যে লেখো।
খ. "My teacher sent me with this note to inform you about tomorrow's meeting." বাক্যটি indirect speech-এ লেখো (উপযুক্ত কাল পরিবর্তনসহ)।
গ. "I last saw him a long time ago." বাক্যে 'last' কী রকম অর্থ বহন করে এখানে—সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করো।
ঘ. "I hope he is in good health." বাক্যটিকে প্রশ্নাত্মকভাবে পুনর্লিখন করো (tag question সহ)।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: তিনি আজ বিকেলে তার শহর (hometown) থেকে ট্রেনে এসে পৌঁছেছেন।

খ উত্তর: He said that his teacher had sent him with that note to inform us about the next day's meeting.  (reported speech-এ 'sent'→'had sent', 'this note'→'that note', 'tomorrow's meeting'→'the next day's meeting' বা 'the meeting the following day' করা হয়।)

গ উত্তর: এখানে 'last' বলতে বোঝানো হচ্ছে 'অনেক দিন আগে' বা 'দূরবর্তী অতীতে'—অর্থাৎ তিনি ওই ব্যক্তিকে সাম্প্রতিককালে দেখেননি; 'last' সময়ের শেষত্ব নয় বরং 'গতকাল' নয়, বরং 'অনেক আগেই' বোঝাচ্ছে (context অনুযায়ী)।

ঘ উত্তর: I hope he is in good health, isn't he?  বা  He is in good health, I hope, isn't he?  (tag question যুক্ত করে প্রার্থনা/আশার সাথে অনুরোধমূলক/নিশ্চয়তা প্রকাশ করা যায়।)

Explanation:
ক: বাক্যটিতে সরাসরি বলা আছে 'I came by train from my hometown this afternoon'—এ থেকে ওঠার মাধ্যম (train) ও সময় (this afternoon) পাওয়া যায়।

খ: reported speech রূপান্তরে সময়-উল্লেখ ও প্রসঙ্গ অনুযায়ী backshift করা হয়: 'sent' becomes 'had sent' এবং 'tomorrow' becomes 'the next day' বা 'the following day'। এছাড়া 'this'→'that' ও 'you'→'us' অনুযায়ী পরিবর্তন করা হয়েছে কারণ বক্তা ও শ্রোতার পরিবর্তন ঘটেছে।

গ: 'last' এখানে সরাসরি 'গত' অর্থে নয় বরং 'অনেক আগে' বা 'অল্প নয় বলে' বোঝায়; এটি বলা হয় 'I last saw him a long time ago'—মানে শেষ দেখা অনেক বছর/মাস আগে হয়েছিল।

ঘ: tag question যোগ করলে বাক্যটি নিশ্চিতকরণ বা সান্ত্বনার স্বর পায়; উদাহরণস্বরূপ 'isn't he?' ট্যাগটি 'he is' অংশের সাথে মিল রেখে ব্যবহৃত হয়।

Question:
“Could you bring the project files on Monday?” I asked my teammate. “I will review them and give you feedback by Tuesday,” he replied. “If I find any issues, I’ll inform you immediately,” he added.

Options:
ক. উক্ত সংলাপটি reported speech (পরোক্ষ বাচ্য) এ রূপান্তর করো।
খ. উক্তির মধ্যে কোন কোন ক্রিয়া (tense) পরিবর্তিত হয়েছে তা নির্ণয় করো এবং কেন সেই পরিবর্তনটি করা হয়েছে সে বিষয়ে সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করো।
গ. ‘I will review them and give you feedback by Tuesday,’ — এই সরাসরি উক্তিটি পরোক্ষ রূপে লিখো যাতে reporting verb হিসেবে ‘said’ ব্যবহৃত হয়।
ঘ. উক্তির সমন্বয়ে একটি একক পরোক্ষ বাক্য লিখো যাতে উভয় বক্তার বক্তব্য সংক্ষেপে প্রকাশ পায়।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক He asked his teammate if he could bring the project files on Monday. He said that he would review them and give him feedback by Tuesday. He added that if he found any issues, he would inform him immediately.

খ পরিবর্তনসমূহ:
- "Could you bring" → reported as "asked if he could bring": 'could' remains appropriate as a past-form polite request triggered by the past reporting verb 'asked'. If the original had been "Can you" it would typically change to "could". Here the speaker's question is reported after a past reporting verb, so modal/tense reflects backshift.
- "I will review" → "he would review": 'will' backshifts to 'would' after a past reporting verb.
- "I’ll inform" / "I will inform" → "he would inform": 'will' backshifts to 'would'.
These changes occur because the reporting verb is in the past (asked/said), so present/future forms in direct speech are typically shifted one step back in time (backshifting) in indirect speech.

গ He said he would review them and give him feedback by Tuesday.

ঘ He asked his teammate to bring the project files on Monday and said he would review them and, if he found any issues, would inform him immediately.

Explanation:
সমগ্র রূপান্তরের মূল নিয়ম হলো reporting verb যদি past হয় (e.g., asked, said), তাহলে সরাসরি বাক্যের present ও future টাইমগুলোকে backshift করে দেয়া হয় (present → past simple বা past modal; will → would)। প্রশ্নবোধক বাক্য reported speech এ 'if/whether' দিয়ে শুরু করা হয় বা 'to' + infinitive ব্যবহার করে অনুরোধ/পরামর্শ রূপে করা যায় (e.g., 'asked him to bring ...'). এছাড়া ব্যক্তিবাচক সর্বনাম ও নির্দেশবাচক শব্দাবলীর (I → he/she, you → me/him/her) পরিবর্তন করা প্রযোজ্য। শেষ অংশে শর্তসূচক বাক্য (If I find any issues) কে সমন্বয়ে backshift করে 'if he found any issues' করা হয়েছে।

ঘ. শিক্ষকের প্রথম দুই বাক্যকে একক reported sentence-এ সংক্ষেপে উপস্থাপন করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The teacher told the students to switch off the lights when they left and warned them not to forget to submit their assignments by Friday. One student replied that they would hand them in on Friday morning.

খ দুইটি ভিন্ন উপায়:
1) Using 'told' + infinitive: The teacher told the students to switch off the lights when they left.
2) Using 'asked' / 'requested' + infinitive (politer): The teacher asked the students to switch off the lights when they left.
(Alternatively, as a reported command: The teacher ordered them to switch off the lights when they left — but tone changes.)

গ She warned them not to forget to submit their assignments by Friday.

ঘ The teacher told the students to switch off the lights when they left and warned them not to forget to submit their assignments by Friday.

Explanation:
নির্দেশ/অনুরোধ/কমান্ড পরোক্ষ বাচ্যে সাধারণত 'told/asked/ordered/urged' ইত্যাদি reporting verbs দিয়ে এবং মূল verb-কে infinitive (to + verb) আকারে লেখা হয়: 'told them to do something'. নেতিবাচক নির্দেশ ('Don't do') reported speech-এ 'not to + verb' হয়: 'told them not to...'. যখন reporting verb হিসেবে 'warn' ব্যবহৃত হয়, তা সাধারণত সতর্কতা বা қандай কনস্ট্রাকশনে 'warn somebody not to do something' আকার নেয়। ছাত্রের প্রত্যুত্তর future tense (will) backshift হয়ে 'would' হয়েছে কারণ reporting verb past tense এ আছে ('replied').

Question:
“Will you help me carry these boxes now?” Anna asked her brother. He answered, “I can help you after lunch, but I must finish my report first.” Anna said, “Alright, I’ll wait.”

Options:
ক. উক্ত আলোচনাটিকে reported speech-এ রূপান্তর করো।
খ. ‘I can help you after lunch’ — এখানে modal 'can' reported speech-এ কীভাবে পরিবর্তিত হবে? ব্যাখ্যা করো।
গ. ‘I must finish my report first’ — ‘must’ reporting এ কোন পরিবর্তন হতে পারে? উপযুক্ত reported sentence লিখো।
ঘ. Anna-এর শেষ বাক্য ‘Alright, I’ll wait.’ — এটি reported speech-এ কিভাবে লেখা হবে? লিখে দেখাও।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Anna asked her brother if he would help her carry the boxes then. He answered that he could help her after lunch but he had to finish his report first. Anna said that she would wait.

খ Modal 'can' in direct speech typically backshifts to 'could' when the reporting verb is in the past. Thus "I can help you after lunch" becomes "he could help her after lunch." The modal 'can' → 'could' reflects the standard backshifting for ability/possibility modals.

গ 'Must' often becomes 'had to' in reported speech when the reporting verb is past. So "I must finish my report first" → "he said he had to finish his report first." (Alternatively, if the necessity still applies at reporting time and is a general truth, 'must' can sometimes remain 'must', but standard practice is to backshift to 'had to'.)

ঘ She said that she would wait.

Explanation:
Reported speech-এ সাধারণ নিয়ম হলো reporting verb যদি past tense হয় তবে present/future/modal forms backshift করা। 'Will' → 'would', 'can' → 'could', 'must' → 'had to' ইত্যাদি। এছাড়া সময়বাচক শব্দ (now → then, today → that day, tomorrow → the next day) পরিবর্তন করতে হয় যদি পরিষ্কার প্রেক্ষাপট প্রয়োজন হয়; এখানে 'now' → 'then' ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে। সর্বনামও পরিবর্তন করা হয় (I → he/she, you → me/him/her)। ঐ বিশেষ ক্ষেত্রে 'must' সম্পর্কে একটি সূক্ষ্মতা রয়েছে: কখনো কখনো শক্ত প্রয়োজনীয়তা আজও প্রযোজ্য হলে 'must' রাখা যেতে পারে, তবে অধিকাংশ পরীক্ষামূলক/শিক্ষাগত পরোক্ষ রূপান্তরে 'had to' ব্যবহার করা হয়।

Question:
A neighborly exchange took place on a rainy evening. He said to his neighbor, 'I'm afraid I may have left the kettle on; would you mind checking it?' She answered, 'Don't worry; I'll look after it. You ought to rest. If you like, stay here for a while.'

Options:
ক. Convert 'I'm afraid I may have left the kettle on' into indirect speech.
খ. Convert 'Would you mind checking it?' into indirect speech.
গ. Convert 'Don't worry; I'll look after it.' into indirect speech.
ঘ. Convert 'If you like, stay here for a while.' into indirect speech.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক He told his neighbour that he was afraid he might have left the kettle on.
খ He asked her if she would mind checking it.
গ She told him not to worry and said that she would look after it.
ঘ She added that if he liked he could stay there for a while.

Explanation:
Rules used and step-by-step reasoning:
- Backshift of tense: Present 'am' → past 'was'; modal 'may' → 'might' when reporting.
- Requests and polite questions: 'Would you mind ...?' becomes 'asked if she would mind ...' or 'asked her to ...' depending on structure; here we preserve the polite indirect form.
- Imperatives/assurances: 'Don't worry' becomes 'told him not to worry'; 'I'll' becomes 'she would' when reporting.
- Conditional offers: 'If you like, stay here' becomes 'if he liked he could stay there' (pronouns and deictic words change: here→there).
Pronoun adjustments and time/place deictic shifts are applied where necessary to make the reported speech natural.

Question:
During a meeting with a teacher, the following dialogue occurred. The teacher said, 'Why did you not submit your assignment? I told you yesterday that late work would not be accepted.' The student replied, 'I'm sorry; my computer crashed. May I hand it in tomorrow?' The teacher answered, 'You may, but only if you email it first.'

Options:
ক. Convert 'Why did you not submit your assignment?' into indirect speech.
খ. Convert 'I told you yesterday that late work would not be accepted.' into indirect speech.
গ. Convert 'I'm sorry; my computer crashed.' and 'May I hand it in tomorrow?' into indirect speech.
ঘ. Convert 'You may, but only if you email it first.' into indirect speech.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The teacher asked the student why he had not submitted his assignment.
খ The teacher said that he had told him the day before that late work would not be accepted.
গ The student apologised that his computer had crashed and asked if he might hand it in the next day.
ঘ The teacher gave him permission to do so but said that he must email it first (or: the teacher allowed him to hand it in the next day provided he emailed it first).

Explanation:
Key points explained:
- Questions in the past: 'Why did you not submit ...?' → 'asked ... why he had not submitted ...' (past perfect used because the action is before the time of reporting).

Question:
On a city tour a tourist spoke to the guide: 'Could you tell me how to get to the museum? Is it far from here? Also, do you know when it opens?' The guide replied, 'It opens at nine. Take the second street on the left. You'll see signs. Don't miss the new gallery.'

Options:
ক. Convert 'Could you tell me how to get to the museum?' into indirect speech.
খ. Convert 'Is it far from here?' into indirect speech.
গ. Convert 'It opens at nine.' into indirect speech.
ঘ. Convert 'Don't miss the new gallery.' into indirect speech.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The tourist asked the guide if he could tell him how to get to the museum (or: the tourist asked the guide to tell him how to get to the museum).
খ He asked whether it was far from there.
গ The guide said that it opened at nine.
ঘ The guide advised him not to miss the new gallery (or: the guide told him not to miss the new gallery).

Explanation:
Conversion notes and reasoning:
- Polite requests/questions: 'Could you tell me ...?' becomes 'asked if he could tell him ...' or 'asked the guide to tell him ...'. Modal 'could' remains 'could' in many reported forms, but may be rendered as 'asked him to' for clarity.
- Yes/no question: 'Is it far from here?' → 'asked whether it was far from there' (here→there).
- Statements about times: 'It opens at nine.' → 'said that it opened at nine' (present simple → past simple in reported speech).
- Imperatives: 'Don't miss ...' → 'advised/told him not to miss ...' (negative imperative becomes 'told/advised not to ...').
- Maintain natural pronoun and deictic shifts (here→there, now/tomorrow→then/the next day) and backshift tenses where appropriate.

The witness told the international crimes tribunal that at about midnight he had heard a loud explosion, come outside and seen several Razakar members together with Pakistani soldiers near his compound. He added that two men had dragged his elderly neighbour away and that later he recognized a man named Karim among the Razakars who had been present that night.

Options:
ক. সাক্ষীর কথাগুলোকে উদ্ধৃতিতে সরাসরি ভাষায় (direct speech) কীভাবে লিখবে?
খ. বিচারক কোন প্রশ্ন করবেন যাতে সাক্ষীর পক্ষ থেকে ব্যক্তিদের পরিচয় নিশ্চিত করা যায়? উপযুক্ত প্রশ্নটি লেখো।
গ. সাক্ষী কাকে চেনেছেন এবং সেই ব্যক্তির ভূমিকা কী বলা হয়েছে?
ঘ. ঘটনার সংক্ষিপ্ত ক্রমানুসারে এক বাক্যে সারমর্ম দাও।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "تقريباً মধ্যরাতে আমি একটি বড় বিস্ফোরণের শব্দ শুনেছি। আমি বাইরে গিয়েছি এবং আমার ফাঁড়ির পাশে কয়েকজন রাজারকার ও পাকিস্তানি সৈন্যদের দেখেছি। দুজন লোক আমার বড় প্রতিবেশীকে জোর করে নিয়ে গেছে," সাক্ষী আন্তর্জাতিক অপরাধ ট্রাইবুনালে বললেন.

খ "আপনি কি বলেন যে এই ব্যক্তিদের চিনতে পেরেছেন? বিশেষ করে যে ব্যক্তিকে আপনি 'কারিম' বলে বললেন, আপনি কি নিশ্চিতভাবে তাকে চিনি?"

গ সাক্ষী বলেছেন যে তিনি 'কারিম' নামে এক ব্যক্তিকে চিনেন; সেই ব্যক্তি রাজারকার দলের সদস্য হিসেবে উপস্থিত ছিল এবং ঘটনার সময় অন্যদের সঙ্গে ছিল (অর্থাৎ স্থানীয় সহযোগী বা দলগত সদস্যের ভূমিকা)।

ঘ মধ্যরাতে বিস্ফোরণের পরে সাক্ষী বাইরে গিয়ে রাজারকার ও পাকিস্তানি সৈন্যদের দেখতে পান, দুজনকে প্রতিবেশীকে জোর করে নিয়ে যাওয়া দেখেন এবং পরে সেখানে উপস্থিত এক রাজারকারকে, কারিমকে, চিনে নেন।

Explanation:
এই উত্তরগুলোর তৈরিকরণে প্রথমে ঘটনাটিকে সরাসরি ভাষায় (direct speech) রূপান্তর করা হয়েছে—সাক্ষীর বিবৃতিকে উদ্ধৃত আকারে লেখার সময় কথ্য ক্রম এবং প্রাসঙ্গিক বিবরণ অক্ষুন্ন রাখা হয়েছে। বিচারকের প্রশ্নটি পরিচয় যাচাই করার উদ্দেশ্যে খোলা এবং সোজাসুস্থ হওয়া উচিত; এজন্য 'আপনি কি নিশ্চিতভাবে তাকে চিনি?' ধরনের প্রশ্ন উপযুক্ত। তৃতীয় অংশে সাক্ষীর স্বীকৃত ব্যক্তির নাম এবং ভূমিকা স্পষ্ট করা হয়েছে—কারিমকে রাজারকার সদস্য হিসেবে চিহ্নিত করা হয়েছে। শেষের সারমর্মে ঘটনাগুলি ক্রমানুসারে সাজানো হয়েছে: বিস্ফোরণ → বাইরে যাওয়া → অস্তিত্ব দেখার বিবরণ → প্রতিবেশীর অপসারণ → স্বীকৃতি। এই পদ্ধতি সাক্ষ্য–বর্ণনার আইনি ও ভাষাগত নির্ভুলতা বজায় রাখতে সাহায্য করে।

Question:
A survivor testified that he had woken to shouts and seen three uniformed soldiers and masked local militiamen setting fire to huts in the southern part of his village. He said a jeep with a Pakistani insignia was parked on the main road and that he could later identify a man called Jalal who was shouting orders from beside the jeep.

Options:
ক. সাক্ষীর কথাটি সংক্ষিপ্ত সরাসরি উদ্ধৃতিতে কিভাবে লিখবে?
খ. বিচারক কীভাবে যাচাই করবেন যে সাক্ষী সত্যিই 'জালাল'কে চিনেছেন? একটি উপযুক্ত প্রশ্ন লিখো।
গ. জালাল কী কাজ করছিল বলে সাক্ষী বলেছে?
ঘ. এই বিবরণ থেকে তিনটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ প্রমাণসংক্রান্ত উপাদান কী কী?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "আমি চিৎকার শুনে ঘুম থেকে উঠলাম। অদূরে তিনজন ইউনিফরম পরিহিত সৈন্য ও মাস্ক পরা স্থানীয় মিলিশিয়া ঘরগুলো জ্বালাচ্ছিল। প্রধান সড়কে পাকিস্তানি প্রতীকাবিহীন একটি জীপ দাঁড়ানো ছিল এবং জীপের পাশে জালাল চিৎকার করে আদেশ দিচ্ছিল," সাক্ষী আদালতে বলেছেন.

খ "আপনি কি নিশ্চিতভাবে বলতে পারবেন যে যে ব্যক্তি জীপের পাশে দাঁড়িয়ে চিৎকার করছিল এবং আদেশ দিচ্ছিল, সেটিই জালাল? আপনি কী কোনো বিশেষ চিহ্ন, কণ্ঠস্বর বা পোশাকের বৈশিষ্ট্য দিয়ে তাকে চেনেছেন?"

গ সাক্ষীর বক্তব্যানুসারে জালাল জীপের পাশে দাঁড়িয়ে দলকে চিৎকার করে আদেশ দিচ্ছিল—অর্থাৎ তিনি নির্দেশদাতা বা কমান্ডারসুলভ ভূমিকায় ছিলেন।

ঘ (১) আগুন লাগানোর প্রত্যক্ষবিবরণ (দুই/তিনজন সৈন্য ও মিলিশিয়া), (২) পাকিস্তানি চিহ্নযুক্ত বা ঐতিহ্যগত জীপের উপস্থিতি যা বাহিনীর অংশ বোঝায়, (৩) জালালের দ্বারা আদেশ প্রদানের সরাসরি স্বীকৃতি—এগুলো সবই দোষস্বরূপ তথ্য হিসেবে প্রমাণে কাজে লাগতে পারে।

Explanation:
উত্তরগুলো নির্ধারণ করার সময় বিচার্য তথ্যগুলিকে আলাদা করে দেখানো হয়েছে: প্রত্যক্ষদর্শীর বর্ণনা (কার্যকলাপ), বাহিনী/যানবাহনের উপস্থিতি (সাংগঠনিক পরিচয়) এবং একটি নামভিত্তিক স্বীকৃতি (ব্যক্তিগত পরিচয়)। বিচারকে সহায়তার জন্য বিচারকের প্রশ্নটি পরিচয় যাচাই সংক্রান্ত নির্দিষ্টতার অনুরোধ করে—যাতে রেকর্ডে নিশ্চিত করা যায় যে সাক্ষী কিভাবে ব্যক্তিকে চিনেছেন (ভাব, চেহারা, কণ্ঠ, পোশাক ইত্যাদি)। শেষের অংশে তিনটি প্রমাণসংক্রান্ত উপাদানকে চিহ্নিত করা হয়েছে, কারণ এগুলো অপরাধের দায় নির্ধারণে সরাসরি প্রাসঙ্গিক।

Question:
During cross-examination at a war crimes hearing a villager stated that at dawn he saw local collaborators called Ansars together with two Pakistani officers rounding up men from the marketplace. He mentioned that one of the collaborators, Ibrahim, pushed a young man into a military-style vehicle. The judge asked whether the witness could pick Ibrahim out of an identity parade.

Options:
ক. সাক্ষীর বর্ণনাটি বিচারকের কোটেশনে একসঙ্গে কিভাবে উপস্থাপন করা যায়? (একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত উদ্ধৃত বাক্য দাও)
খ. যদি বিচারক পরিচয় যাচাইর জন্য পরিচয় পরিদর্শন (identity parade) এর কথা বলেন, সাক্ষীকে কীভাবে নির্দেশ দেওয়া উচিত — একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত অনুশাসন লেখো?
গ. সাক্ষীর বর্ণনা থেকে 'বীভ্রণের' (Ibrahim-এর) কার্যকলাপ কী ছিল?
ঘ. এই ঘটনার গুরুত্বর ভিত্তিতে বিচারে কোন ধরনের অভিযোগ প্রাসঙ্গিক হতে পারে? সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "ভোরে আমি আর্থিক বাজারে দেখলাম স্থানীয় অনুজ্জীবী (Ansar) এবং দুইজন পাকিস্তানি অফিসার লোকদের ধরে নিয়ে যাচ্ছিল; আমি দেখেছি ইব্রাহিম নামে এক সহযোগী এক যুবককে জোর করে ওই সামরিক ধাঁচের ভ্যানের মধ্যে ঠেলে দিলেন," সাক্ষী কোর্টে বললেন.

খ "আপনি যদি পরিচয় পরিদর্শনে অংশ নেন, অনুগ্রহ করে শুধুমাত্র আপনার স্মৃতির উপর ভিত্তি করে কোনো ব্যক্তিকে চিহ্নিত করুন; কাউকে ইশারা করার আগে কোনো কথা বা তথ্য শোনাবেন না এবং যদি আপনি অপরিচিত হন বা অনিশ্চিত থাকেন, তা খোলাখুলি জানাবেন।"

গ সাক্ষী বর্ণনা অনুযায়ী ইব্রাহিম সরাসরি এক যুবককে জোরপূর্বক সামরিক ধাঁচের যানবাহনে ঠেলে দিয়েছিলেন—অর্থাৎ ইব্রাহিম অপহরণ বা জোরপূর্বক গ্রেপ্তারের অংশগ্রহণকারী হিসেবে কাজ করেছিল।

ঘ ঘটনাটির ভিত্তিতে সংশ্লিষ্ট অভিযোগ হতে পারে গ্রেপ্তার-অপহরণ (unlawful arrest/abduction) এবং সহায়তা বা সমন্বয়ের মাধ্যমে মানবাধিকার লঙ্ঘন; যদি প্রমাণ পাওয়া যায় যে এই পদক্ষেপ আরোপিত নিপীড়ন, হিংসা বা সরকারি বাহিনীর অধীনে সংগঠিত হয়, তবে শাস্তিযোগ্য আন্তর্জাতিক অপরাধ (উদাহরণ: ব্যাক্তিগত স্বাধীনতার হরণ বা সমন্বিত নিপীড়ন)ও বিবেচিত হতে পারে।

Explanation:
উত্তরগুলিতে প্রথমে সাক্ষীর বর্ণনাকে একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত সরাসরি কোট করে উপস্থাপন করা হয়েছে যাতে মূল ঘন্টার ক্রমানুসারে পরিষ্কার থাকে—বাজারে লোক ধরে নেওয়া এবং ইব্রাহিমের কার্যকলাপ। পরিচয় পরিদর্শন সম্পর্কে নির্দেশটি প্র্যাকটিক্যাল আইনগত অনুশাসন অনুসারে দেয়া—যাতে পরিচয় নির্ভরযোগ্য থাকে এবং প্রভাবিত না হয়। তৃতীয় অংশে ইব্রাহিমের ক্রিয়াকলাপকে অপহরণ/জোরপূর্বক গ্রেপ্তার হিসেবে চিহ্নিত করা হয়েছে। শেষ অংশে কৌনসিলিয়ার ভাবনায় আইনি শ্রেণীবদ্ধকরণ দেয়া হয়েছে: নির্ধারিত অভিযোগগুলো প্রাদেশিক এবং আন্তর্জাতিক আইন অনুযায়ী কী ধরণের অপরাধের আওতায় পড়তে পারে তা সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়েছে।

Question:
"Whose hat is this?" I asked. "Peter's, of course," said Tom. "Can't you tell?" "Yes, but do you know Peter?" "Yes, I knew him," said Tom, "but he was a very forgetful man and I shouldn't tell you about him."

Options:
ক. প্রথম সরাসরি প্রশ্নটিকে পরোক্ষ ভাষায় অনুবাদ করো।
খ. টমের প্রথম উত্তরের পরোক্ষ রূপ লেখো।
গ. টমের "Can't you tell?" অংশটি পরোক্ষভাবে কীভাবে বলবা?
ঘ. টমের শেষ মন্তব্যটি (he was a very forgetful man and I shouldn't tell you about him) পরোক্ষ ভাষায় অনুবাদ করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক I asked whose hat it was. খ Tom replied that it was Peter's. গ I asked whether I couldn't tell/He asked if I couldn't tell (context decides the subject); better: I asked whether I could not tell. ঘ Tom said that he had known Peter but that Peter had been a very forgetful man and he would not tell me about him.

Explanation:
To convert each direct utterance into indirect speech we apply standard backshifting rules and adjust pronouns and time expressions. (ক) The present-tense question "Whose hat is this?" becomes past-tense in reported speech: "I asked whose hat it was." (খ) Short answers like "Peter's, of course" are expanded: Tom said that it was Peter's. (গ) Yes/no questions are reported with if/whether: "Can't you tell?" becomes I asked whether I could not tell (or He asked if I couldn't tell, depending on who is the implied subject). Note the modal change from 'can' to 'could'. (ঘ) For the final remark we backshift tenses and modals: "I knew him" → said he had known him; "he was a very forgetful man" → that he had been a very forgetful man; "I shouldn't tell you about him" → he said he would not tell me about him. Pronouns are adjusted to match the reporter's perspective.

গ. "Do you know him?" কে পরোক্ষভাবে কীভাবে বলা হবে?
ঘ. Mrs. Dale-এর শেষ বাক্যটি পরোক্ষ ভাষায় কী হবে?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক I asked whose postcard that was. খ Mrs. Dale replied that it was a schoolboy's. গ I asked whether she knew him. ঘ She said that she had known him well but that he had sometimes been dishonest and she was afraid she could not speak well of him.

Explanation:
When reporting these sentences we change present/past simple in the original to past perfect or past where appropriate and use 'whether' for yes/no questions. (ক) "Whose postcard is this?" → I asked whose postcard that was (is → was). (খ) Short identifications like "A schoolboy's" are reported fully: she replied that it was a schoolboy's. (গ) "Do you know him?" becomes I asked whether she knew him (do → did/ knew depending on backshift; here 'knew' is used). (ঘ) In the final complex remark: "I knew him well" → she had known him well; "he used to be dishonest sometimes" → he had sometimes been dishonest; "I can't speak well of him" → she said she could not (or could not) speak well of him. Modal verbs shift (can → could) and tense is backshifted for consistency.

Explanation:
Apply backshift and pronoun changes while reporting: (ক) 'is this' becomes 'it was'. (খ) Short replies expand to full clauses with 'that'. (গ) A yes/no question 'You recognise the hand?' becomes 'I asked whether she recognised the handwriting' (present 'recognise' backshifts to 'recognised'). (ঘ) The compound remark is reported with past perfect/backshift: 'I knew the man once' → she had known him once; 'he behaved very badly' → he had behaved very badly; 'I mustn't tell you' → she said she must not (or, to reflect past perspective and reporting convention, 'could not') tell me about his faults. Modal verbs and tense are adjusted to maintain sequence of tenses and speaker perspective.

Question:
A kindly governor was walking through the market at dusk when he noticed an old man stooping to gather scattered grains from the ground. The governor approached and asked about the man's actions. The old man replied that his daughter was sick and they had no money for medicine; he had lost his walking stick earlier and hoped to sell the grains for a small sum.

গ. শাসকটি বৃদ্ধাকে কী প্রতিশ্রুতি দিল?
ঘ. এক বাক্যে পুরো ঘটনা সারমর্ম করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The governor asked the old man why he was stooping to gather grains; the old man answered that his daughter was ill, they had no money for medicine, and he hoped to sell the collected grains because he had lost his walking stick and needed money.

খ The old man was collecting grains from the ground to sell them for a small amount of money to buy medicine and support his sick daughter.

গ The governor promised to find a way to help the old man and his family, implying he would provide assistance or arrange needed support.

ঘ A governor found an old man collecting grains to pay for his sick daughter's medicine and vowed to help him.

Explanation:
ক: The dialogue is direct: the governor's question prompts the man's explanation. The answer identifies both the governor's inquiry and the man's reply. খ: The motive is economic and urgent—collecting grains to sell for medicine—so the explanation states the practical reason. গ: The governor's response is compassionate and non-specific; he offers to help, which is recorded as a promise to assist. ঘ: The one-sentence summary captures the key characters, problem, and outcome. This structure shows cause (illness, lack of money), action (collecting grains), and reaction (official offers help).

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The merchant asked the mother why she was crying; she replied that she was selling her child's toy to buy bread because her husband had been injured and could not work.

খ She wanted to sell the toy to raise money for bread and basic necessities since the family had lost its main income due to the husband's injury.

গ The merchant offered to pay for the bread and the child's medicine, effectively covering the immediate needs and relieving the mother's burden.

ঘ A compassionate bystander intervened to relieve a struggling family's urgent needs, demonstrating empathy and practical assistance.

Explanation:
ক: The merchant's simple question elicits the mother's plight; the answer records both the question and the reason she was crying. খ: The motive for selling the toy is economic hardship caused by the husband's injury; this links action to necessity. গ: The merchant's response is concrete help—paying for essentials—so the solution states that clearly. ঘ: The moral point emphasizes empathy translated into action: noticing suffering and responding with help rather than indifference.
