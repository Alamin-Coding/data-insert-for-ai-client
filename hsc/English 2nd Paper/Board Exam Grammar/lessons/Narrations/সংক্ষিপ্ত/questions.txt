Question:
“You’re cut off your hair?” asked Jim. “Cut it off and sold it,” said Delia. “Don’t you like me just as well, any how? I’m me, without my hair, amn’t I?”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Delia cut and sold her hair to buy Jim a gift, so when she asks “Don’t you like me just as well…?” she is asking for reassurance that Jim loves her for herself, not for her hair. The correct answer (that Jim still loves her) fits because her question reveals worry about losing his affection, and the story shows their love matters more than appearance or possessions.

Question:
‘Follow my example,” she said as we shook hands, “and never eat more than one thing for luncheon.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The sentence is an example of direct speech split by a reporting clause: "she said as we shook hands" tells when and how the words were spoken while the speaker was giving two imperatives. The commas and quotation marks correctly separate the reporting clause from the two parts of the same utterance, showing both commands belong to one spoken sentence.

“Have you cut your hair off?” asked Jim. “Cut it off and sold it,” said Delia. “Don’t you like me just as well, anyhow? I’m me without my hair, am’t I ?”

Options:


Correct Answer:

Delia asks that to express her fear and insecurity after cutting and selling her hair to buy Jim a gift; she worries that losing her long hair might make her less lovable. The line shows the story’s theme that true love values the person, not outward appearance, and highlights her sacrifice and hope that Jim will still love her for who she is.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Correct form: “Follow my example,” she said, as we shook hands, “and never eat more than one thing for luncheon.” “I’ll do better than that,” I said. “I’ll eat nothing for dinner tonight.”

Explanation: When a speaker-tag interrupts the same sentence, replace the terminal punctuation with a comma inside the quotation and continue with a lowercase letter; when a new sentence or a new speaker begins, end the quotation (with a period) and start a fresh quoted sentence with a capital letter.

Question:
The writer said to Jerry, “Your roller-skates look very nice. Who has bought them for you?”

“My mother.” “Is she alive?”

“Yes, she lives in Mannville”.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The reply "Yes, she lives in Mannville" correctly answers "Is she alive?" because it both confirms that the mother is alive and gives her place of residence; saying someone "lives" somewhere implies they are living. This shows that the question sought confirmation of life, and the answer provides that confirmation plus extra information.

Question:
He said, “I can chop some wood today.” I said, “But I have a boy coming from the orphanage.” “I’m the boy.” “You? But you’re small.” “Size doesn’t matter chopping wood,” he said.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer is that the boy from the orphanage is offering to chop wood despite being small. From the dialogue we infer that physical size doesn’t determine ability—his statement “Size doesn’t matter chopping wood” shows he believes skill, not size, is what counts.

Question:
“Take the fan,” said Edna, offering a fan to him. “Oh, no! Thank you. It does no good. You have to stop fanning some time, and feel all the more uncomfortable afterward.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
He refuses the fan because Edna explains that fanning only gives temporary relief and when you stop you feel even more uncomfortable, so it's pointless. This shows the idea that a short-lived remedy can worsen overall comfort once it ends.

Question:
“You’re cut off your hair?” asked Jim. “Cut it off and sold it,” said Delia. “Don’t you like me just as well, any how? I’m me, without my hair, amn’t I?”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Delia’s words show she has cut and sold her hair to buy a gift and is asking Jim if he still loves her despite the change; the correct answer points out that she seeks reassurance that her identity and worth haven’t changed. This reveals the underlying idea that outward appearance (her hair) doesn’t alter who she is, and the passage emphasizes sacrifice and the need for emotional acceptance.

Question:
‘Follow my example,” she said as we shook hands, “and never eat more than one thing for luncheon.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct reported form is: She told me, as we shook hands, to follow her example and never to eat more than one thing for luncheon. We use "told" + object + infinitive to report commands (so "follow" → "to follow" and "never eat" → "never to eat"), and change "my" to "her" to match the speaker's perspective; the clause "as we shook hands" remains as an adverbial phrase.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer is right because Delia, having cut and sold her hair, asks Jim if he still loves her to show that she believes her worth and identity haven’t changed. This highlights the idea that true love and a person’s identity are not based on outward appearance but on who they are inside.

Question:
“Follow my example” she said, as we shook hands “and never eat more than one thing for luncheon.” I’ll do better than that” I said. ‘I’ll eat nothing for dinner tonight.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The answer is correct because the speaker playfully “one-ups” her advice: instead of following her rule of eating at most one thing for lunch, he says he’ll do better by eating nothing for dinner, which is an exaggerated, literal way to outdo her. The underlying concept is verbal wit/irony—using hyperbole (extreme understatement or excess) to create a humorous contrast between sensible moderation and an absurd extreme.
