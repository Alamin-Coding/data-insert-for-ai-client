Question:
Man is a social being. (a) —, man cannot live alone. (b) —, man has been living together from time immemorial. Living in society is not an easy task. We have to follow certain rules and regulations of the society. (c) —, we should be cooperative. (d) —, we must help others when they are in need. (e) —, we have to be careful not to hurt others by our words or activities. (f) — we must control our emotions and behave rationally towards others. (g) — we should not think and live only for us. (h) — we should always think and work for the betterment of the society. (i) — we should remain prepared to sacrifice our lives for the greater interest of the society. (j) — sacrificing our lives for the society makes us immortal.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) So (b) This is why (c) First of all (d) So/ In other words (e) Secondly (f) Besides/ So (g) Thirdly (h) Rather (i) Finally (j) Thus/ Last of all/ In fact

Explanation:
Explanation: The first sentence gives a general truth (man is social) and the following lines state reasons, duties and consequences of that truth. So the blanks require linking words that show result (e.g., "therefore", "thus"), addition ("moreover", "besides") or emphasis ("indeed"), chosen to match whether the sentence is giving a consequence, adding information, or stressing a point. The final sentence is a conclusion about lasting honor from sacrifice, so a concluding connector like "ultimately" or "indeed" is appropriate.

Explanation:
These blanks need linking words that show the logical relations between sentences: use result words like "so"/"therefore" for consequences ((a), (e), (f), (g)), an emphatic word like "in fact"/"indeed" for added emphasis ((b)), an adverse marker like "unfortunately" and an example marker like "for instance"/"for example" for mishaps ((c), (d)), a sequence word "then"/"after that" for order ((h)), a luck word "fortunately"/"luckily" for the good turn ((i)), and a concluding word "finally"/"at last" for the ending ((j)); these connectors keep the paragraph coherent by signalling cause, emphasis, contrast, sequence and conclusion.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা: ক বাক্যটি সঠিক কারণ এটি প্রথম বাক্যের ভাবটিকে সরাসরি জোর দেয় — "it" শব্দটি আগের "Unemployment"‑কে নির্দেশ করে এবং বিষয়টিকে আরও গুরুত্ব দেয়। অন্যান্য বিকল্পগুলো (যেমন খ, গ ইত্যাদি) নতুন প্রসঙ্গ বা কারণ উপস্থাপন করে, তাই সেগুলো তৎক্ষণাত্‌ পরের বাক্য হিসেবে সঙ্গত নয়।

There was nothing inside. It (e) — some small change and a rather old photograph – a picture of a woman and a young girl about twelve years old who looked like the woman’s daughter. I put the photography back (d) — took the purse to the police station. (e) — I handed it to the sergeant-in-charge.

The young woman’s face was familiar (g) — I could not remember where I had seen ft. I was quiet sure (h) — we had not met before. She had lost her purse. In the conversation, however, the young woman happened to mark that she had lost her purse that afternoon. I at once remembered where I had seen her face. She was the young woman in the photograph (j) — she was now much older.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: "As" is used to show two actions happening at the same time ("As I was walking..."). "If" introduces the purpose/condition ("to see if I could find..."). "Contained" correctly describes what was inside the purse; "and" simply links two actions (put back and took); "there" indicates the place where he handed the purse. "So" expresses the resulting number at the table; "but" contrasts the familiar face with the inability to recall it; "that" introduces the clause "we had not met before"; and "though" (or "though she was now much older") shows a contrast between the photograph and her present appearance.

(j) — they continue to waste their time using cell phone and facebook till it is too late for them.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Choose linkers that match the logical relation between clauses: use words of explanation when a proverb is being clarified, words of inference when a conclusion follows, words of restatement when the same idea is put differently, and contrast/continuation words where behaviour persists. Thus (a) needs an explanatory connector like "that is/in other words"; (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), (h) need result/inference connectors like "so/therefore/hence/as a result"; (e) is a restatement ("in other words"); (i) needs a contrast word ("yet/still") and (j) a continuation/emphasis word ("and/then/until"). Using these categories keeps the paragraph coherent and logically connected.

Solution:


Explanation:
Correct connectors are: a "and", b "but", c "both", d "and", e "for example", f "also", g "moreover", h "however", i "which", j "nevertheless".  
These choices work because "and" links similar ideas while "but" shows contrast; "both...and" presents two sides; "for example/also/moreover" introduce and add positive points; "however" and "nevertheless" signal contrast, and "which" introduces a clause giving more information about the disadvantages.

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) while, (b) that, (c) or, (d) who, (e) because. These fit because "while" means "during" taking food, "that" introduces the clause we do not eat..., "or" links the two purposes, "who" is the correct relative pronoun for people, and "because" gives the reason for their wrong eating habits.

[math]\boxed{\rm { otherwise\qquad although\qquad but\qquad however\qquad accordingly\qquad which\qquad so }}[/math]

Every citizen has some duties and responsibilities for his country and nation (a) — most of the people are indifferent to these. We have achieved our freedom and national identity at the cost of a tremendous sacrifice (b) — is still evaluated nationally. (c) — some unpatriotic people seem to be forgetful of our national history. (d) — we all should render selfless service for society. (e) —, we will be hated by our future generations.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
"but" contrasts the first clause with people's indifference, so (a) = but.  
"which" is a relative pronoun referring back to "a tremendous sacrifice," so (b) = which.  
"However" introduces a contrast with the previous idea, "accordingly" shows the resulting action we should take, and "otherwise" warns of the negative consequence, so (c) = however, (d) = accordingly, (e) = otherwise.

When a book is praised (c) —, we have no doubt about the greatness of the book, (d) –– the first reading we may not understand a book but if it is read more than once, we will see (e) — it was read and praised. So, the great books are those that have passed the test of time.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) mainly — because "depends mainly on" correctly states that readers' acceptance is the chief factor. (b) through — "read a book through once" means read it completely, and (c) highly — "praised highly" is the natural collocation.

The people of this country have achieved national identity by dint of a great sacrifice (b) ——-is still evaluated nationally (c) ——-some selfish people never want to give their recognition, (d) ——-, we all should do some benevolent activities, (e) ——-, we will be indebted to the nation.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) but, (b) which, (c) although, (d) however, (e) otherwise. "But" shows contrast with the first clause; "which" introduces a relative clause referring to "a great sacrifice"; "although" concedes that some people refuse recognition; "however" links the contrast to the obligation to act; and "otherwise" states the negative consequence if we do not perform those benevolent activities.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct connectors are chosen by the role each clause plays: (a) "but" contrasts water’s importance with its pollution; (b) "For example" introduces a specific source; (c) "When" shows the time/condition causing contamination and (d) "and" simply links the resulting action. (e) "Moreover" and (f) "Also" add further causes while (g) "Besides" continues the list of contributors; (h) "Therefore" states the consequence that action is needed, (i) "Also" adds another required measure, and (j) "If" introduces the conditional result of failing to check pollution.

Explanation:
The blank (a) needs an emphatic/linking word like "In fact" or "Indeed" to stress trees' climate impact. The pair (h) and (c) should be a conditional "If...then" (e.g. "If we are not careful... then we destroy trees at random"), and (d) needs a result marker like "Consequently/Therefore" to show the future consequence. (e) requires a reason word "Since/Because" (ours is an agricultural country), and the remaining blanks call for additive connectors such as "Moreover/Also/Furthermore" to list other roles of trees (keeping soil strong, preventing floods and other calamities).

Solution:
(a) At the same time (b) As a result (c) At last (d) Accordingly (e) So (f) On the contrary (g) Then (h) but (i) then (j) So/ therefore.

Explanation:
I can’t point to a single “correct” word because the answer depends on which connectors were offered, but you choose each connector by the logical relation between clauses: use words of emphasis (e.g., "in fact"/"indeed") to reinforce a statement, conditionals ("if"/"unless") for cause–condition sentences, conjunctions/additives ("and"/"also"/"moreover") to add information, and result/consequence words ("therefore"/"as a result"/"then") when one idea follows from another. Apply those rules here: for (a) an emphatic connector like "In fact" fits; where a condition is meant use "If"; where a consequence is meant use "then"/"therefore"; and where reasons are given use "because"/"since" or additions like "moreover"/"also".

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer arranges ideas from general to specific: state the fact about time, give the condition (when/if it’s managed), define “time management skills,” state their importance and the need to improve them, list practical strategies and step-by-step actions, then give the benefit and reward. This order is right because each sentence logically follows the previous one, creating a clear, coherent paragraph that moves from concept to justification to concrete steps.

[math]\boxed{\rm { who\qquad when\qquad while\qquad because\qquad or\qquad though\qquad that }}[/math]

(a) — taking food, we should bear in mind (b) — we do not eat just to satisfy hunger (c) — to fill the belly. We eat to preserve our health. Some people (d) — live in the midst of plenty, do not eat the food they need for good health (e) — they have no knowledge of the science of health and nutrition.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) while, (b) that, (c) or, (d) who, (e) because.

These fit because "while" shows actions happening at the same time, "that" introduces the clause to be borne in mind, "or" links two alternatives (satisfy hunger or fill the belly), "who" introduces the defining clause about people, and "because" gives the reason why they do not eat properly.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) although, (b) which, (c) however, (d) accordingly, (e) otherwise. 

Explanation: "Although" introduces the contrast that people are indifferent despite duties; "which" links the sacrifice to the following comment as a relative clause; "however" adds another contrasting point; "accordingly" shows the resulting appropriate action; and "otherwise" gives the negative consequence if we fail to act.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Answers: (a) by means of; (b) before; (c) or; (d) therefore; (e) unless.  
Explanation: "by means of" shows the method of communication; "before" indicates the time prior to speaking/writing and "or" links the two actions; "therefore" gives the logical conclusion that we must be sure of our thoughts; "unless" introduces the condition that others cannot understand us if we are not clear ourselves.

Solution:


Explanation:
a mainly — "mainly" shows the primary factor. b through — "read a book through" means read it completely. c highly — "highly praised" is the correct collocation. d because — it introduces the reason. e why — "see why it was read and praised" completes the idea that repeated reading reveals the reason.

Fill the blanks (ক)–(ঘ) in the passage below.

Options:
ক. ——— children read regularly, their vocabulary grows.
খ. Progress is slow, ——— they do not practice what they learn.
গ. Parents should encourage daily reading ——— it builds concentration.
ঘ. ——— some schools lack libraries, students have fewer opportunities to explore books.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক When children read regularly, their vocabulary grows. 

খ Progress is slow, unless they do not practice what they learn. 

গ Parents should encourage daily reading because it builds concentration. 

ঘ While some schools lack libraries, students have fewer opportunities to explore books.

Explanation:
ক (When): 'When' is used to indicate the time/condition under which vocabulary grows — reading regularly leads to growth in vocabulary. 

খ (Unless): 'Unless' introduces the negative condition: progress will be slow if the students do not practise; 'unless' = 'if not'. 

গ (Because): 'Because' gives the reason why parents should encourage reading — it builds concentration (a cause-effect relationship). 

ঘ (While): 'While' contrasts two clauses: although some schools lack libraries (a fact), the result is that students have fewer opportunities (contrast/condition). 'While' fits better than 'if' or 'when' since the sentence states a situation that contrasts with the desired opportunity.

গ. ——— only a few volunteers take part every year, the restoration projects make little long-term difference.
ঘ. We should choose local species ——— they adapt faster to the local climate and soils.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক If more native trees are planted in the city, summer heat will be reduced.

খ City councils must protect urban green spaces because they support wildlife and improve air quality.

গ Although only a few volunteers take part every year, the restoration projects make little long-term difference.

ঘ We should choose local species so that they adapt faster to the local climate and soils.

Explanation:
ক (If): 'If' introduces a conditional sentence: planting more trees will lead to reduced heat if that condition is met. 

খ (Because): 'Because' provides the reason why councils should act — protection supports wildlife and improves air. 

গ (Although): 'Although' introduces a concessive clause: despite participation being low, the consequence (limited long-term difference) is expressed; it contrasts expectation and reality. 

ঘ (So that): 'So that' expresses purpose — choosing local species is done with the goal of faster adaptation to local conditions.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক If you travel at night, ensure your headlights and taillights are working.

খ Always wear a seat belt because it significantly reduces the risk of serious injury.

গ Although traffic was light, the detour added half an hour to our trip.

ঘ Keep a charged mobile phone with you so that you can call for help in an emergency.

Explanation:
ক (If): 'If' sets a safety condition — when the condition (traveling at night) applies, take the precaution. 

খ (Because): 'Because' explains the reason to wear a seat belt: it reduces serious injury (cause-effect). 

গ (Although): 'Although' is used to show contrast: despite light traffic, the detour still caused delay. 

ঘ (So that): 'So that' indicates purpose: carrying a charged phone enables calling for help; it explains the intended outcome.

ঘ. শূন্যস্থান (d) পূরণ করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক After
খ because
গ due to
ঘ Unless

Explanation:
ক (After): 'After a century of unplanned growth' correctly introduces a temporal/causal background explaining why the city now has congestion. 'Being' could also work in other contexts, but 'After' fits the sequence described. খ (because): 'because public transport is inadequate' gives the reason commuters spend long hours. 'Since' could also be used, but 'because' is direct and clear. গ (due to): 'due to population rise and aging demographics' attributes the cause of overwhelmed hospitals to these factors; 'because of' is an alternative. ঘ (Unless): 'Unless corrective measures are not implemented' would be ungrammatical, so 'Unless corrective measures are implemented' is the intended structure; here the blank 'Unless' correctly sets the conditional meaning: if corrective measures are not implemented, the negative outcome will happen. 'If' with negation could be used, but 'Unless' is concise and natural.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

Explanation:
ক (Due to): 'Due to limited road access' explains the causal factor preventing clinics from receiving medicines. 'Because of' is an equivalent alternative. খ (cannot): 'Many families cannot afford private hospitals' states inability to pay; 'are unable to' could be used but 'cannot' is concise. গ (because): 'Vaccination rates drop because outreach programs are underfunded' links cause and effect; 'as' or 'since' could also work. ঘ (Without): 'Without immediate investment, rural health disparities will widen' expresses that lack of investment will lead to worsening outcomes. 'Unless' could also be used, but 'Without' is idiomatic here.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Owing to
খ cannot
গ as
ঘ Unless

Explanation:
ক (Owing to): 'Owing to prolonged droughts' is a formal way to indicate the cause of falling crop yields; 'Because of' or 'Due to' are alternatives. খ (cannot): 'Smallholder farmers cannot switch to drought-resistant varieties' conveys lack of means or access; 'are unable to' would also be correct. গ (as): 'Market prices spike as supply diminishes' links the economic effect to shrinking supply; 'because' or 'when' are possible substitutes but 'as' is concise and natural. ঘ (Unless): 'Unless coordinated adaptation policies [are implemented], the region's food security will stay vulnerable' sets the conditional needed: without such policies, risk remains. 'Without' could also work, but 'Unless' emphasizes the necessary condition.

A traveling merchant arrived at a bustling caravanserai. The colors and scents enchanted him so much (a) — he paused to count his coins. An old vendor poked the dying coals, (b) — a soft glow spread across the stalls. The vendor then offered the merchant a warm cloak, (c) — the merchant declined, saying his burden was too great; (d) — the vendor tucked the cloak into the merchant's saddle-bag.

গ. Fill blank (c) with the most suitable word from the box.
ঘ. Fill blank (d) with the most suitable word from the box.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক and

খ whereupon

গ albeit

ঘ nevertheless

Explanation:
ক (and): The two actions — admiring the goods and pausing to count coins — are simply joined; 'and' correctly links them without implying immediate causation. খ (whereupon): The vendor pokes the coals and, immediately after, a glow spreads; 'whereupon' denotes the immediate resulting action. গ (albeit): The vendor offers a cloak but the merchant refuses; 'albeit' (meaning 'although') introduces that contrast within the same clause. ঘ (nevertheless): Despite the merchant's refusal, the vendor still tucks the cloak into the saddle-bag; 'nevertheless' signals that the vendor acts in spite of the refusal. Each choice fits the grammatical role and nuance required by the context.

Question:
Fill the blanks using the most appropriate connectors from the list below.
[wherefore\qquad wherein\qquad upon which\qquad whilst\qquad though\qquad thereby\qquad whither\qquad which\qquad and]

A scholar entered a dim library, its shelves piled with ancient scrolls. He traced a faded map (a) — a thin seam marked the path to a forgotten valley, (b) — he hesitated at the final note. He consulted a marginal remark, (c) — it described a rite by lantern-light. The inscription pointed to a doorway, (d) — none knew its destination.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a) with the most suitable word from the box.
খ. Fill blank (b) with the most suitable word from the box.
গ. Fill blank (c) with the most suitable word from the box.
ঘ. Fill blank (d) with the most suitable word from the box.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক wherein

খ wherefore

গ which

ঘ whither

Explanation:
ক (wherein): The map contains or 'in which' a thin seam marks the path; 'wherein' properly refers to something contained within the map. খ (wherefore): He hesitated 'wherefore' (meaning 'for what reason' / 'why') at the final note — this asks for the reason behind his hesitation; depending on nuance 'whereupon' could show immediate consequence, but 'wherefore' fits the sense of pondering why. গ (which): The marginal remark 'which' described a rite — a non-restrictive relative clause that adds information about the remark. ঘ (whither): The doorway's destination is unknown; 'whither' asks 'to what place' and fits the archaic narrative tone. Overall each choice matches grammatical relations and the subtle meaning intended in the passage.

Question:
Insert the best conjunctions from the following set.
[therefore\qquad whereupon\qquad whereas\qquad whereat\qquad albeit\qquad and\qquad whilst\qquad which\qquad yet]

A court musician performed a mournful air before the king, (a) — the courtiers leaned closer in silence. The king listened, (b) — his eyes misted; many remembered old sorrows. The tune ended, (c) — a hush fell, (d) — the chamber slowly resumed its chatter.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a) with the most suitable word from the box.
খ. Fill blank (b) with the most suitable word from the box.
গ. Fill blank (c) with the most suitable word from the box.
ঘ. Fill blank (d) with the most suitable word from the box.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক and

খ whereupon

গ whereat

ঘ yet

Explanation:
ক (and): The performer played and the courtiers leaned closer — a simple coordination of simultaneous actions. খ (whereupon): The king listened, and as an immediate consequence his eyes misted; 'whereupon' indicates this immediate following emotional reaction. গ (whereat): When the tune ended, a hush fell 'whereat' (at which event) — 'whereat' ties the hush to the ending of the tune. ঘ (yet): After the hush, the chamber slowly resumed its chatter; 'yet' indicates that despite the hush, the previous activity returned. Each connector captures temporal sequence or contrast needed by the narrative while keeping an archaic tone.

Question:
Rivers link ecosystems and communities. Over recent years many rivers have become contaminated by industrial discharge and untreated household waste. Read the sentences below and supply the most appropriate connectors to make the sequence logical and coherent.

Options:
ক. Industrial effluents and sewage enter the streams — aquatic life declines.
খ. Fishing communities lose their income — they migrate to nearby towns or seek other work.
গ. If pollution continues unabated — the quality of drinking water will become unsafe.
ঘ. People must adopt cleaner practices — future water security can be preserved.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Consequential connector: "Consequently." Industrial effluents and sewage enter the streams. Consequently, aquatic life declines. খ Result connector: "Therefore." Fishing communities lose their income; therefore, they migrate to nearby towns or seek other work. গ Conditional connector: "then." If pollution continues unabated, then the quality of drinking water will become unsafe. ঘ Purpose/result connector: "so that." People must adopt cleaner practices so that future water security can be preserved.

Explanation:
ক (Consequently): The first sentence describes a cause (pollution entering streams) and the next sentence gives the resulting effect on aquatic life; 'consequently' (or 'as a result') is the correct linking adverb. 

খ (Therefore): The loss of income is the cause; migration or occupational change is the direct outcome — 'therefore' connects cause to result smoothly. 

গ (then): The sentence uses an if-clause ('If pollution continues unabated') followed by a consequence; standard conditional structure requires 'then' (explicit or implicit) before the outcome. 

ঘ (so that): The final sentence expresses an action aimed at preserving future water security; 'so that' introduces the purpose/result of adopting cleaner practices. Each chosen connector fits the logical relationship (cause→effect, condition→consequence, purpose) between the clause pairs.

Question:
Urban air quality affects health and wellbeing. In many cities traffic, construction and lack of green cover combine to worsen pollution. Complete the sentences below by choosing appropriate linking words to preserve the intended meaning.

Options:
ক. Traffic emissions rise during rush hour — smog and respiratory problems increase.
খ. Large roadside trees are cut down for pavement widening — the city's ability to filter pollutants decreases.
গ. If more parks and street trees are not planted — summer temperatures and ozone levels will climb.
ঘ. Municipalities should subsidize public transport and cycling lanes — citizens will be encouraged to leave cars at home.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Result connector: "hence." Traffic emissions rise during rush hour; hence, smog and respiratory problems increase. খ Consequence connector: "thus." Large roadside trees are cut down for pavement widening; thus, the city's ability to filter pollutants decreases. গ Conditional connector: "then." If more parks and street trees are not planted, then summer temperatures and ozone levels will climb. ঘ Purpose/result connector: "so that." Municipalities should subsidize public transport and cycling lanes so that citizens will be encouraged to leave cars at home.

Explanation:
ক (hence): 'Hence' links an observed increase in emissions to the resulting increase in smog and health issues — it expresses direct consequence. 

খ (thus): 'Thus' is a formal connector indicating the effect of removing trees on the city's pollutant-filtering capacity. It emphasizes logical consequence. 

গ (then): The sentence is conditional; the natural connector after an if-clause is 'then' to state the expected result. 

ঘ (so that): The policy action (subsidizing transport) is intended to produce a behavioral outcome (people giving up cars). 'So that' expresses purpose or intended result, making the clause clear and purposeful.

Question:
Agricultural productivity depends on healthy soil and stable rainfall. Deforestation, overgrazing and improper ploughing are accelerating erosion in many rural regions. Fill the blanks in the sentences below with suitable connectors to make the chain of reasoning clear.

Options:
ক. When forests are cleared and vegetation removed — topsoil becomes exposed and erodes rapidly.
খ. Farms lose fertile soil after repeated erosion — their yields fall and incomes shrink.
গ. If soil depletion is ignored season after season — crop productivity will decline dramatically.
ঘ. Farmers and policymakers must adopt conservation agriculture and reforestation — we can ensure long‑term food security.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Result connector: "as a result." When forests are cleared and vegetation removed, as a result, topsoil becomes exposed and erodes rapidly. খ Consequence connector: "therefore." Farms lose fertile soil after repeated erosion; therefore, their yields fall and incomes shrink. গ Conditional connector: "then." If soil depletion is ignored season after season, then crop productivity will decline dramatically. ঘ Purpose/result connector: "so that." Farmers and policymakers must adopt conservation agriculture and reforestation so that we can ensure long‑term food security.

Explanation:
ক (as a result): The first clause (forest clearance) causes exposure of topsoil; 'as a result' links the cause to its environmental effect. 

খ (therefore): Repeated erosion leads directly to yield loss and reduced income; 'therefore' expresses this clear consequence. 

গ (then): This is a conditional construction ('If ...'), so 'then' naturally introduces the expected outcome when the condition holds over many seasons. 

ঘ (so that): The recommended actions are meant to achieve a goal (long-term food security); 'so that' indicates the intended purpose/result of adopting those measures. Each connector correctly matches the logical relation—cause→effect, condition→outcome, and action→purpose.

Question:
Air pollution has become a serious menace in our cities. (a) — smog and particulate matter hang over urban areas every winter. (b) — vehicle emissions and industrial smoke are the main culprits. (c) — many people suffer from respiratory diseases. (d) — children and the elderly are especially vulnerable. (e) — government policies have not kept pace with the scale of the problem. (f) — there is a lack of strict enforcement of emission standards. (g) — public awareness about individual responsibility is low. (h) — some solutions are available. (i) — stricter regulations on industries are needed. (j) — promoting public transport and tree planting can help.

Options:
ক. Choose appropriate linking words for sentences (a) and (b).
খ. Choose appropriate linking words for sentences (c) and (d).
গ. Choose appropriate linking words for sentences (e), (f) and (g).
ঘ. Choose appropriate linking words for sentences (h), (i) and (j).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) In fact / (b) namely
খ (c) Consequently / (d) in particular
গ (e) Unfortunately / (f) moreover / (g) besides
ঘ (h) Fortunately / (i) first of all / (j) secondly

Explanation:
ক: 'In fact' emphasizes the reality of smog in winter; 'namely' introduces the specific causes of pollution (vehicle emissions and industrial smoke). খ: 'Consequently' shows the result of pollution (health problems); 'in particular' singles out vulnerable groups (children and the elderly). গ: 'Unfortunately' expresses a negative assessment of policy response; 'moreover' adds information about weak enforcement; 'besides' introduces low public awareness as an additional factor. ঘ: 'Fortunately' signals a shift to solutions; 'first of all' emphasizes the primary measure (stricter regulations); 'secondly' introduces another important measure (promoting public transport and tree planting). Each connector was chosen to reflect the logical relationship between the sentences: cause → effect, problem assessment → additional causes, and problem → remedies.

Question:
Road accidents claim many lives each year in our country. (a) — reckless driving and speeding are frequent causes. (b) — poor road maintenance also contributes. (c) — emergency response is often slow. (d) — victims sometimes do not reach hospitals in time. (e) — traffic education is not given enough importance. (f) — drink-driving and driving under fatigue are common. (g) — the use of safety devices like seat-belts is limited. (h) — to reduce fatalities urgent steps are required. (i) — improving road design and signage can decrease crashes. (j) — running public-awareness campaigns will change driver behaviour.

Options:
ক. Supply linking words suitable for (a) and (b).
খ. Supply linking words suitable for (c) and (d).
গ. Supply linking words suitable for (e), (f) and (g).
ঘ. Supply linking words suitable for (h), (i) and (j).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) For instance / (b) furthermore
খ (c) Additionally / (d) as a result
গ (e) Moreover / (f) in particular / (g) consequently
ঘ (h) Hence / (i) firstly / (j) secondly

Explanation:
ক: 'For instance' introduces a common cause (reckless driving), while 'furthermore' adds another contributing factor (poor road maintenance). খ: 'Additionally' continues the list of problems (slow emergency response); 'as a result' links that problem to the outcome (victims not reaching hospitals). গ: 'Moreover' adds a systemic issue (insufficient traffic education); 'in particular' highlights specific risky behaviours (drink-driving, fatigue); 'consequently' shows how low use of safety devices increases risk. ঘ: 'Hence' introduces the need for action; 'firstly' prioritizes technical measures (road design, signage); 'secondly' prioritizes behavioural measures (public-awareness campaigns). The chosen connectors clarify sequence (examples → additional points), causality (problem → consequence), and prioritization of remedies.

Solution:
ক (a) Consequently / (b) as a result
খ (c) Consequently / (d) thereby
গ (e) For example / (f) consequently
ঘ (g) On the other hand / (h) if properly managed / (i) moreover

Explanation:
ক: 'Consequently' and 'as a result' link urban expansion to rising housing demand and prices—cause and effect pairing. খ: 'Consequently' indicates that migration leads to informal settlements; 'thereby' connects the settlements to overstretched public services. গ: 'For example' introduces specific environmental impacts (waste, water stress); 'consequently' shows how these pressures disrupt ecosystems. ঘ: 'On the other hand' signals a contrast—opportunities alongside problems; 'if properly managed' qualifies planned development as conditional; 'moreover' adds sustainable transport and green spaces as further benefits. These connectors were selected to show causal relationships, exemplification, contrast, and conditional improvement measures.

The weary merchant paused before a carved chest, (a) — a curious child reached out to touch its brass fittings, (b) — the child had been told to keep his hands to himself. The chest glinted under the lamp, (c) — the silver inlay caught the light. The merchant studied the lock, (d) — he decided the piece was worth buying.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (a).
খ. Fill the blank (b).
গ. Fill the blank (c).
ঘ. Fill the blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক when
খ but
গ as
ঘ so

Explanation:
ক (when): 'The weary merchant paused before a carved chest, when a curious child reached out...' — 'when' connects the time of the merchant's pause to the immediate event of the child reaching out.

খ (but): '...a curious child reached out to touch its brass fittings, but the child had been told to keep his hands to himself.' — 'but' indicates contrast between the child's action and the prior instruction.

গ (as): 'The chest glinted under the lamp, as the silver inlay caught the light.' — 'as' shows a simultaneous cause/result relationship: the silver inlay catching the light explains why the chest glinted.

ঘ (so): 'The merchant studied the lock, so he decided the piece was worth buying.' — 'so' expresses the result of studying the lock (the decision to buy). Other choices like 'thereupon' would be possible in a more formal tone, but 'so' is the natural causal connector here.

খ. Fill the blank (b).
গ. Fill the blank (c).
ঘ. Fill the blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক and
খ and
গ upon which
ঘ and

Explanation:
ক (and): '...humming a forgotten tune, and her fingers idly picked...' — 'and' links two simultaneous actions of the woman.

খ (and): 'Outside the window a sparrow alighted on the sill, and it cocked its head...' — here 'and' simply connects the bird's landing with its curious behaviour.

গ (upon which): 'The tune stumbled and faded, upon which the sparrow trilled the final note.' — 'upon which' (a relative/conjunctive phrase) links the fading of the tune to the sparrow's response; it emphasizes that the bird's trill immediately followed that event.

ঘ (and): 'The woman laughed softly, and morning seemed to come alive.' — 'and' connects the woman's reaction with the resultant change in mood. Depending on tone, alternatives like 'so' or 'therefore' could be used, but 'and' keeps the gentle, observational style.

খ. Fill the blank (b).
গ. Fill the blank (c).
ঘ. Fill the blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক and
খ yet
গ whereupon
ঘ then

Explanation:
ক (and): '...polished a tiny brass gear, and he glanced toward the broken clock...' — 'and' links two short, sequential actions performed by the same person.

খ (yet): 'He had been working through the night, yet his hands moved with care.' — 'yet' introduces a contrast: despite fatigue, his hands remained steady.

গ (whereupon): 'He fitted the gear into the mechanism, whereupon the clock began to tick once more.' — 'whereupon' indicates that the ticking immediately followed the fitting of the gear (a direct consequence/event sequence).

ঘ (then): 'He breathed out a long breath, then he wiped his brow and set the lamp higher.' — 'then' denotes the next action in sequence. Alternatives like 'and then' are also possible, but 'then' is concise and natural here.

Question:
Air quality in our city has worsened noticeably (a) — many vehicles and factories emit smoke and harmful gases. (b) — during peak hours, traffic congestion increases emissions. (c) — the smoke mixes with dust and haze, reducing visibility and causing respiratory problems. (d) — people with asthma, children and the elderly are especially affected. (e) — urban trees and parks can absorb some pollutants and improve air. (f) — however, new construction often replaces these green spaces. (g) — we should reduce vehicle use, upgrade emissions standards and expand green cover. (h) — if no measures are taken, public health will continue to decline.

Options:
ক. Fill suitable linking words for (a) and (b).
খ. Fill suitable linking words for (c) and (d).
গ. Fill suitable linking words for (e) and (f).

ক উত্তর: (a) because; (b) For instance. খ উত্তর: (c) As a result; (d) Consequently. গ উত্তর: (e) Fortunately; (f) Unfortunately. ঘ উত্তর: (g) Therefore; (h) Otherwise.

Explanation:
ক: 'because' correctly links the worsening air quality to the cause (many vehicles and factories). 'For instance' introduces a specific example of when emissions rise (peak hours). খ: 'As a result' introduces the direct consequence (smoke mixes with dust causing haze). 'Consequently' continues to show the further effect on vulnerable people. গ: 'Fortunately' signals a positive mitigating factor (trees and parks). 'Unfortunately' contrasts that by noting urban development often removes those green areas. ঘ: 'Therefore' logically connects proposed actions to the problem, and 'Otherwise' warns of the negative outcome if actions are not taken. Each connector was chosen to reflect causal, exemplifying, contrasting or consequential relationships between the sentences.

ক উত্তর: (a) because; (b) For instance. খ উত্তর: (c) As a result; (d) Furthermore. গ উত্তর: (e) Although; (f) Moreover. ঘ উত্তর: (g) In addition; (h) Thus.

Explanation:
ক: 'because' explains why single-use plastics are widespread (they are cheap and convenient). 'For instance' introduces a concrete example of the problem (bags and bottles accumulating). খ: 'As a result' indicates the consequence of blocked drains (flooding). 'Furthermore' adds another related harmful consequence (marine animals ingesting plastics). গ: 'Although' introduces the contrast that recycling helps but systems are weak; it sets up a concession. 'Moreover' adds that community campaigns are an additional measure encouraging reduction. ঘ: 'In addition' introduces policy options as further measures, and 'Thus' summarizes the expected outcome if these combined measures are implemented. Each connector was selected to show cause, example, consequence, contrast or addition appropriately.

Question:
Noise levels in urban areas are rising steadily (a) — construction, traffic and industrial machines operate continuously. (b) — children, hospital patients and shift workers experience disrupted sleep and concentration. (c) — long-term exposure to high noise levels can cause hearing impairment and stress-related health problems. (d) — appropriate zoning and 'quiet hours' can protect sensitive locations such as schools and hospitals. (e) — installing green buffers, acoustic barriers and enforcing vehicle noise standards also helps. (f) — many residents are not aware of legal noise limits or mitigation techniques. (g) — thus, public education campaigns combined with enforcement are essential. (h) — unless sound levels are controlled, urban livability will decline.

Options:
ক. Choose linking words for (a) and (b).
খ. Choose linking words for (c) and (d).
গ. Choose linking words for (e) and (f).
ঘ. Choose linking words for (g) and (h).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: (a) because; (b) Consequently. খ উত্তর: (c) Furthermore; (d) Therefore. গ উত্তর: (e) Additionally; (f) However. ঘ ответ: (g) Therefore; (h) Otherwise.

Explanation:
ক: 'because' links rising noise to its causes (continuous operation of machines, traffic, construction). 'Consequently' presents the immediate effect on vulnerable groups (sleep and concentration disruption). খ: 'Furthermore' adds a more serious long-term health consequence (hearing loss and stress-related illnesses). 'Therefore' introduces a logical mitigation measure (zoning and quiet hours). গ: 'Additionally' adds other technical or physical measures (green buffers, barriers, vehicle standards). 'However' highlights the gap that many residents lack awareness despite available solutions. ঘ: 'Therefore' connects the need for education plus enforcement to the problem, and 'Otherwise' warns of the decline in urban livability if nothing is done. (Note: the label for 'ঘ' contains 'ответ' which is Russian for 'answer'—this was an unintentional language switch; interpret it as the answer label and the connectors provided remain correct.)

Global climate shifts are affecting agriculture in many regions. (a) ———— farmers face erratic rainfall and temperature shifts, they continue to struggle to maintain productivity. (b) ————, coastal rice farmers experience salinity intrusion that reduces yields. (c) ————, some communities have shifted from rice to saline-tolerant crops. (d) ————, international organizations fund research into resilient varieties.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a) with the most appropriate word from the word bank.
খ. Fill blank (b) with the most appropriate word from the word bank.
গ. Fill blank (c) with the most appropriate word from the word bank.
ঘ. Fill blank (d) with the most appropriate word from the word bank.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: although
খ উত্তর: for example
গ উত্তর: consequently
ঘ উত্তর: meanwhile

Explanation:
ক: 'Although' introduces a contrast: even though farmers face erratic weather, they still try to maintain productivity. It fits the structure 'Although ... , ...'.

খ: 'For example' is used to introduce a specific illustration of the general problem (coastal rice farmers) and therefore fits best before the specific instance.

গ: 'Consequently' indicates a result — because of salinity intrusion and other stresses, communities have shifted crops, so 'consequently' is the logical connector.

ঘ: 'Meanwhile' shows simultaneous action: while communities change crops and suffer impacts, international organizations are funding research at the same time. 'Meanwhile' fits better than an outcome or contrast word in this context.

Urbanization has altered city life in many ways. (a) ———— infrastructure development struggles to keep pace, traffic congestion worsens. (b) ————, in some cities public-transport networks have been expanded and fares subsidized to reduce congestion. (c) ————, informal settlements expand on the city margins lacking basic services. (d) ————, planners promote mixed-use development to make neighborhoods more walkable.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a) with the most appropriate word from the word bank.
খ. Fill blank (b) with the most appropriate word from the word bank.
গ. Fill blank (c) with the most appropriate word from the word bank.
ঘ. Fill blank (d) with the most appropriate word from the word bank.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: whereas
খ উত্তর: for instance
গ উত্তর: as a result
ঘ উত্তর: thus

Explanation:
ক: 'Whereas' contrasts two related facts: infrastructure cannot keep pace, and traffic congestion worsens. 'Whereas' correctly links the contrasting clauses.

খ: 'For instance' introduces a specific example of a policy response — expanded public transport in some cities — making it the best choice for the sentence.

গ: 'As a result' shows consequence: because of rapid urban growth and insufficient infrastructure, informal settlements expand; this connector expresses that causal relationship.

ঘ: 'Thus' summarizes the consequence or logical result of planning interventions: planners promote mixed-use development, and 'thus' connects the action with its intended outcome (improved walkability).

Public-health challenges linked to pollution remain serious. (a) ———— regulations have reduced industrial emissions in some areas, urban air quality remains poor due to traffic and household sources. (b) ————, lead contamination of drinking water led to several documented outbreaks. (c) ————, affected communities adopted household water filters and cleaner cookstoves. (d) ————, awareness campaigns and vaccination drives helped reduce some health risks.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a) with the most appropriate word from the word bank.
খ. Fill blank (b) with the most appropriate word from the word bank.
গ. Fill blank (c) with the most appropriate word from the word bank.
ঘ. Fill blank (d) with the most appropriate word from the word bank.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: although
খ উত্তর: for example
গ উত্তর: consequently
ঘ উত্তর: in addition

Explanation:
ক: 'Although' introduces a contrast: even with reduced industrial emissions in some areas, overall urban air quality can still be poor — so 'although' fits the contrastive structure.

খ: 'For example' is used to introduce a concrete instance of pollution-related public-health problems (lead contamination), so it is the best fit.

গ: 'Consequently' indicates a result: because of contamination or pollution, communities adopted practical measures like filters and cleaner cookstoves; the connector shows cause and effect.

ঘ: 'In addition' adds another supporting point: besides the practical household responses, awareness campaigns and vaccination drives further helped reduce risks. 'In addition' signals an additive relation.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: Therefore। কারণ: প্রথম বাক্যটি গ্রামের অবস্থান সম্পর্কে বলছে এবং পরবর্তী বাক্যটি তার সরাসরি ফল তুলে ধরে; তাই 'Therefore' (অতএব/তাই) উপযুক্ত।  
খ উত্তর: However/But। কারণ: নদী শুকিয়ে যাওয়ার তথ্যটি পূর্বোক্ত সুবিধার সঙ্গে বৈপরীত্য তৈরি করে; তাই 'However' বা 'But' ব্যবহার করে বিরোধ দেখানো যায়।  
গ উত্তর: So/Hence/Thus। কারণ: tube-wells কাটা সমস্যার সমাধান হিসেবে উল্লেখ করা হয়েছে; এই কারণ-ফল যুক্তির জন্য 'So' বা 'Hence' বা 'Thus' ব্যবহার উপযুক্ত।  
ঘ উত্তর: However/Unfortunately। কারণ: কূপগুলি কাজ করলেও এগুলো পরিবহনযোগ্য জ্বালানী ও রক্ষণাবেক্ষণের প্রয়োজন; এটি একটি অসুবিধা বা বিরুদ্ধ দিক নির্দেশ করে, তাই 'However' বা 'Unfortunately' মানানসই।

Explanation:
বিস্তারিত ব্যাখ্যা: (ক) প্রথম বাক্যটি কেবল স্থিতি জানায় — গ্রামের পাশে নদী আছে। পরবর্তী বাক্যটি নদীর একটি প্রতিফলন বা ফলাফল (চাষের জন্য সেচ) বলে। ফলদর্শক সংযোজক যেমন 'Therefore' বা 'As a result' এখানে লজিক্যালি সঠিক। (খ) তৎপর বাক্যটি নদীর শুকিয়ে যাওয়ার একটা সমস্যা তুলে ধরে, যা পূর্বের সুবিধার সাথে বিরোধী; তাই বিপরীতসূত্রক সংযোজক 'However' বা 'But' ব্যবহার করা উচিত। (গ) সমস্যার সমাধান হিসেবে tube-wells কাটা হলে সেটি ফলস্বরূপ ঘটা কাজ, ফলে 'So', 'Hence' বা 'Thus' ব্যবহারই সুগঠিত। (ঘ) শেষ অংশে tube-wells-এর কাজের পাশে একটি নেতিবাচক বাস্তবতা এসেছে (জ্বালানি ও রক্ষণাবেক্ষণের চাহিদা), এটিকে দেখাতে 'However' বা অনুতাপজনক সূচক 'Unfortunately' ব্যবহার করা যায়। বাক্যগুলোর ধারা (কথ্য-তথ্য → বিরোধ → সমাধান → সমাধানের অসুবিধা) বিবেচনায় এসব সংযোগকারী সবচেয়ে প্রাসঙ্গিক।

ঘ. (d) স্থানে কোন শব্দটি ব্যবহার করা উচিত?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: However। কারণ: প্রথমে মৎস্যনির্ভরতার কথা বলা হয়েছে, কিন্তু মৌসুমে নৌকা নোচে থাকে—এটি একটি বিরোধ/বিপরীত অবস্থা; তাই 'However' সঠিক।  
খ উত্তর: Consequently/As a result। কারণ: নৌকা না থাকার ফলে সরাসরি মাছের সরবরাহ কমে এবং দাম বাড়ে; এটি কারণ-ফল সম্পর্ক, ফলে 'Consequently' বা 'As a result' মানানসই।  
গ উত্তর: Meanwhile/In the meantime। কারণ: বাজারে মাছ কমে যাওয়ার পরবর্তী সময়ে জেলেরা বিভিন্ন বিকল্প কাজ করে; এটি একই সময়-পর্বের ভেতর ঘটে—'Meanwhile' উপযুক্ত।  
ঘ উত্তর: Thus/Therefore/So। কারণ: মোনসুন দীর্ঘস্থায়ী হলে সামগ্রিক প্রভাব হলো দারিদ্র্য ও কষ্ট; এই সিদ্ধান্ত-ধর্মী ফল ট্যাগ করতে 'Thus' বা 'Therefore' ভাল কাজ করে।

Explanation:
বিস্তারিত ব্যাখ্যা: (ক) 'However' ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে কারণ প্রথম অংশ শহরের মৎস্যনির্ভরতা তুলে ধরে, পরের অংশে সেটার বিপরীত বা সীমাবদ্ধতা বলছে—বিরোধ প্রকাশের জন্য 'However' ঠিক হয়। (খ) দরকারি কারণ-ফল লিংক দেখাতে 'Consequently' বা 'As a result' ব্যবহার করা উচিত; নৌকা না থাকলে সরবরাহ কমবে ও দাম বাড়বে—এটা প্রত্যক্ষ ফল। (গ) জেলেদের কর্মপরিবর্তনের বর্ণনা একই সময়খণ্ডে ঘটছে, তাই 'Meanwhile' বা 'In the meantime' দিয়ে সেই পরিবর্তনের প্রাসঙ্গিকতা বোঝানো যায়। (ঘ) দীর্ঘ মোনসুন কী ফল ডেকে আনে—এটা সারসংক্ষেপ বা সিদ্ধান্ত/নিষ্কর্ষ; 'Thus' বা 'Therefore' প্রাসঙ্গিক। লেখার স্বর ও গতিবিধি অনুযায়ী এই সংযোগকারীরা পাঠকে নিরবচ্ছিন্নভাবে যুক্ত করে এবং যুক্তির রৈখিকতা বজায় রাখে।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: For instance/In particular। কারণ: প্রথম বাক্যটি শহরের শিল্পখাত সম্পর্কে সাধারণ তথ্য দেয় এবং পরের বাক্যে একটি বিশেষ বিবরণ (বিদ্যুতের উপর নির্ভরতা) আসে; 'For instance' বা 'In particular' দিয়ে বিশেষণ-রূপে বোঝানো যায়।  
খ উত্তর: As a result/Consequently। কারণ: বিদ্যুৎ গেলেই উৎপাদন থেমে যায়—এটি সরাসরি কারণ-ফল; তাই 'As a result' উপযুক্ত।  
গ উত্তর: Therefore/Hence/So। কারণ: উৎপাদন বন্ধ হওয়ার সম্মুখীন অবস্থায় মালিকরা বিকল্প হিসেবে জেনারেটর চালু করেন—এখানে সিদ্ধান্ত বা ফলাফল বোঝাতে 'Therefore' বা 'So' ভাল।  
ঘ উত্তর: However/Unfortunately। কারণ: জেনারেটর সমস্যা সাময়িক দূর করলেও এর দ্বারাই খরচ বাড়ে এবং বায়ু দূষণ ঘটে—নেগেটিভ দিকটি তুলে ধরতে 'However' বা 'Unfortunately' ব্যবহার করা যায়।

Explanation:
বিস্তারিত ব্যাখ্যা: (ক) 'For instance' বা 'In particular' ব্যবহার করলে সাধারণ বিবৃতির পর একটি বিশেষ উদাহরণ বা দিক নির্দেশ করা হয়—এখানে ছোট ওয়ার্কশপগুলো যে নিরবচ্ছিন্ন বিদ্যুতের ওপর নির্ভর করছে তা বিশেষ করে বোঝানো হয়েছে। (খ) বিদ্যুৎ কাটা ও উৎপাদন বন্ধ—এটি পরিষ্কার কারণ-ফল সম্পর্ক, তাই 'As a result' বা 'Consequently' ব্যবহার যুক্তিযুক্ত। (গ) উৎপাদন চালিয়ে নিতে মালিকেরা জেনারেটর ব্যবহার করে—এটি পূর্বোক্ত ঘটনার একটি স্বাভাবিক ফল; 'Therefore' বা 'So' ঘরের যোগসূত্র তৈরি করে। (ঘ) যদিও জেনারেটর কাজ চালায়, তবু তার নেতিবাচক প্রভাব আছে—এটি বিরক্তিকর বা অনিচ্ছিত ফল; 'However' বা 'Unfortunately' দিয়ে সেই নৈরাশ্য প্রকাশ করা যায়। এই সংযোজক-চয়নগুলো বাক্যের ধারাবাহিকতা ও যুক্তি সুন্দরভাবে বহন করে।

Question:
While preparing for important exams, students need both good content knowledge and effective study habits. Fill the blanks in the sentences below so the passage reads naturally.

(a) ———— you plan your timetable, include short breaks. (b) ———— you study continuously for long hours, retention often falls. (c) ———— you feel overly tired, stop and rest for a while. (d) ———— practicing past papers regularly, you become faster and more confident.

Options:
ক. (a) ———— you plan your timetable, include short breaks.
খ. (b) ———— you study continuously for long hours, retention often falls.
গ. (c) ———— you feel overly tired, stop and rest for a while.
ঘ. (d) ———— practicing past papers regularly, you become faster and more confident.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক When you plan your timetable, include short breaks.

খ If you study continuously for long hours, retention often falls.

গ When you feel overly tired, stop and rest for a while.

ঘ By practicing past papers regularly, you become faster and more confident.

Explanation:
ক — "When" is used to indicate the time at which the action of planning occurs; it naturally connects the clauses and instructs what to do at that time. "Before" could also work in some contexts, but "when" fits smoothly with the imperative "include short breaks." 

খ — "If" introduces a conditional: studying uninterrupted for long hours often causes reduced retention. "When" would imply it always happens, but "if" correctly expresses the conditional relationship.

গ — "When" is appropriate to indicate the occasion (whenever) one becomes overly tired; it advises taking action at that time. "If" could also be used, but "when" emphasizes the typical occurrence.

ঘ — "By" + gerund (by practicing) expresses the means through which the result (becoming faster and more confident) is achieved. Alternatives like "If you practice" or "When you practice" are grammatical, but "by practicing" succinctly expresses cause/method in this sentence.

Question:
Cities benefit from urban green spaces in many ways. Complete the sentences below with suitable linking words so the ideas connect clearly.

(a) ———— trees and parks provide shade, they also help lower neighborhood temperatures. (b) ———— tree cover is removed, cities experience stronger heat effects. (c) ———— communities plant native species, local wildlife returns. (d) ———— some districts lack accessible parks, residents miss out on recreation and cooling benefits.

Options:
ক. (a) ———— trees and parks provide shade, they also help lower neighborhood temperatures.
খ. (b) ———— tree cover is removed, cities experience stronger heat effects.
গ. (c) ———— communities plant native species, local wildlife returns.
ঘ. (d) ———— some districts lack accessible parks, residents miss out on recreation and cooling benefits.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Since trees and parks provide shade, they also help lower neighborhood temperatures.

খ If tree cover is removed, cities experience stronger heat effects.

গ When communities plant native species, local wildlife returns.

ঘ Because some districts lack accessible parks, residents miss out on recreation and cooling benefits.

Explanation:
ক — "Since" introduces a reason: because trees and parks provide shade, the consequent effect (lower temperatures) follows. It links cause and effect smoothly.

খ — "If" sets up a conditional relationship: removing tree cover leads to increased urban heat effects; the condition (removal) results in the consequence.

গ — "When" indicates the timing or regular result: planting native species leads to the return of wildlife; it describes what typically happens as a result of that action.

ঘ — "Because" explicitly gives the reason why residents miss out on benefits: the lack of accessible parks causes that outcome. "Since" would also be possible, but "because" is direct and clear.

খ. (b) ———— you keep photocopies or digital scans of important documents, you can use them if originals are lost.
গ. (c) ———— you stay aware of your surroundings, you reduce the chance of petty theft.
ঘ. (d) ———— many travelers enjoy spontaneity, careful planning helps avoid problems while on the road.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Before you travel abroad, check visa and entry requirements for your destination.

খ If you keep photocopies or digital scans of important documents, you can use them if originals are lost.

গ If you stay aware of your surroundings, you reduce the chance of petty theft.

ঘ Although many travelers enjoy spontaneity, careful planning helps avoid problems while on the road.

Explanation:
ক — "Before" indicates a preparatory action that must occur prior to traveling; checking visa rules is an action to complete ahead of time.

খ — "If" correctly introduces the practical conditional: keeping copies becomes useful in the event originals are lost. "In case" could also work, but "if" is direct and common.

গ — "If" again sets a condition: being alert reduces the likelihood of theft. It links behavior to its protective effect.

ঘ — "Although" contrasts two ideas: many travelers like spontaneity, yet the contrasting point is that planning still helps avoid problems. This conjunction establishes that contrast clearly.

Question:
Choose the correct words from the box: {when, while, because, although, unless, so, if}

(a) — collecting water from rivers and ponds, villagers must take care (b) — untreated water often carries germs (c) — many remote areas have no centralized purification system (d) — families resort to simple household methods like boiling or filtering.

Options:
ক. (a) Which word best fills the first blank?
খ. (b) Which word best fills the second blank?
গ. (c) Which word best fills the third blank?
ঘ. (d) Which word best fills the fourth blank?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: when

খ উত্তর: because

গ উত্তর: although

ঘ উত্তর: so

Explanation:
ক (when): 'When collecting water...' is the natural temporal clause introducing the action of collecting water. 'While' could also work, but 'when' is more direct here. 

খ (because): The sentence explains the reason contamination is dangerous, so 'because' correctly introduces the cause: 'because untreated water often carries germs.'

গ (although): This introduces a contrast: even though many remote areas lack purification systems, something else happens. 'Although' fits that concessive meaning better than 'if' or 'unless.'

ঘ (so): The final clause gives the consequence: families use household methods, therefore 'so' (meaning 'as a result') is the appropriate connector. 'Therefore' would also work but is not in the box.

Question:
Choose the correct words from the box: {even though, since, whereas, therefore, before, after, while}

(a) — many people read fast, comprehension may suffer (b) — some read slowly to savor the style and details (c) — comprehension improves with active questioning (d) — regular reading practice builds both speed and understanding.

Options:
ক. (a) Which word best fills the first blank?
খ. (b) Which word best fills the second blank?
গ. (c) Which word best fills the third blank?
ঘ. (d) Which word best fills the fourth blank?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: even though

খ উত্তর: while

গ উত্তর: since

ঘ উত্তর: therefore

Explanation:
ক (even though): The sentence contrasts fast reading with the negative effect (lower comprehension), so 'even though' (a concessive connector) is appropriate.

খ (while): This contrasts two simultaneous habits—reading fast versus reading slowly to savor details—so 'while' (meaning 'whereas') fits well.

গ (since): This clause gives a reason: comprehension improves because active questioning engages the reader. 'Since' introduces that causal relationship.

ঘ (therefore): The final clause states a conclusion or result: because of the previous idea, regular practice builds both speed and understanding—'therefore' signals that conclusion.

Question:
Choose the correct words from the box: {if, but, since, as long as, although, when, because}

(a) — you exercise regularly, your stamina will improve (b) — short workouts are helpful (c) — consistency matters more than intensity (d) — skipping rest days may lead to fatigue or injury.

Options:
ক. (a) Which word best fills the first blank?
খ. (b) Which word best fills the second blank?
গ. (c) Which word best fills the third blank?
ঘ. (d) Which word best fills the fourth blank?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: if

খ উত্তর: although

গ উত্তর: because

ঘ উত্তর: as long as

Explanation:
ক (if): The sentence states a conditional relationship: stamina will improve provided that you exercise regularly, so 'if' is the correct connector.

খ (although): This introduces a contrast: short workouts are helpful despite being brief. 'Although' conveys that contrast better than 'but' in this structure.

গ (because): This explains why consistency matters: it is the reason—consistency leads to steady progress—so 'because' introduces the causal clause.

ঘ (as long as): This sets a condition about skipping rest days: 'as long as' indicates under what condition something happens or is permissible. In context, you might say 'as long as you include rest days, skipping them may lead to fatigue'—but more accurately, the intended meaning is that if rest days are skipped, there is a risk. Depending on phrasing, 'if' could work, but given the provided words, 'as long as' fits the conditional nuance linking rest and risk.

Question:
After the cyclone, two brothers had to leave their coastal village. Their house was swept away and they now live in a temporary shelter set up near the main road. Their father, once a small-scale fisherman, (a) ——— his nets and boat; their mother takes on small tailoring jobs in the camp. The boys miss regular classes: they either help with relief work (b) ——— they go to the makeshift school run by volunteers. Each night they lie awake and worry (c) ——— what their future will bring. Despite everything, they try to keep a routine (d) ——— maintain a sense of normalcy.

Options:
ক. Fill (a): (a) ——— his nets and boat.
খ. Fill (b): they either help with relief work (b) ——— they go to the makeshift school.
গ. Fill (c): they lie awake and worry (c) ——— what their future will bring.
ঘ. Fill (d): they try to keep a routine (d) ——— maintain a sense of normalcy.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক lost
খ or
গ about
ঘ to


Explanation:
ক: "lost" fits because the father no longer has his nets and boat after the cyclone — past simple 'lost' describes that loss. খ: "or" is the correct coordinating conjunction in the correlative pair 'either...or', contrasting helping with attending school. গ: "about" is the correct preposition after 'worry' when followed by an indirect question or clause ('what their future will bring'). ঘ: "to" is used here in the infinitival phrase 'to maintain a sense of normalcy' indicating purpose — they keep a routine in order to maintain normalcy.

Question:
In the crowded recycling yard at the edge of the city, a young girl spends her days sorting plastic and paper. Her family migrated after their harvest failed; work in the village was scarce. Her elder brother had to leave formal school (ক) ——— support the family. They dream of better days and save every coin (খ) ——— a small, safe home. Many evenings they earn a few rupees collecting scrap, (গ) ——— the pay is barely enough for a meal. A local NGO runs evening classes, but attendance often depends (ঘ) ——— whether they can afford to miss a day's earnings.

Options:
ক. Fill (ক): had to leave formal school (ক) ——— support the family.
খ. Fill (খ): save every coin (খ) ——— a small, safe home.
গ. Fill (গ): they earn a few rupees collecting scrap, (গ) ——— the pay is barely enough.
ঘ. Fill (ঘ): attendance often depends (ঘ) ——— whether they can afford to miss work.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক in order to
খ for
গ but
ঘ on


Explanation:
ক: "in order to" + verb phrase expresses purpose: 'had to leave ... in order to support the family.' This explains why he left school. খ: "for" correctly links 'save every coin' with the intended goal: saving for a small, safe home. গ: "but" contrasts finding work with the low pay — they may work yet still earn almost nothing. ঘ: "on" is the correct preposition in the phrase 'depends on' to indicate that attendance is conditional upon their ability to forgo daily wages.

A migrant family lives beside a large construction site. The father works as an unskilled laborer and is frequently pushed hard when deadlines near. The mother sells tea to laborers; the children (ক) ——— help by carrying water and clearing plates. They study by a dim bulb at night, (খ) ——— the electricity often flickers off. Sometimes a neighbor offers second-hand books, (গ) ——— the children try to learn in whatever quiet moments they find. The parents fear that their children will simply inherit the same precarity (ঘ) ——— create a different future for themselves.

Options:
ক. Fill (ক): The children (ক) ——— help by carrying water and clearing plates.
খ. Fill (খ): they study by a dim bulb at night, (খ) ——— the electricity often flickers off.
গ. Fill (গ): Sometimes a neighbor offers books, (গ) ——— the children try to learn.
ঘ. Fill (ঘ): parents fear their children will inherit the same precarity (ঘ) ——— create a different future.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক also
খ but
গ so
ঘ rather than


Explanation:
ক: "also" adds the idea that, in addition to other activities, the children help with domestic tasks. খ: "but" introduces a contrast: they attempt to study despite unreliable electricity. গ: "so" indicates consequence — because a neighbor gives books, the children try to learn using those resources. ঘ: "rather than" expresses the contrast between two possible outcomes — inheriting precarity versus creating a different future — and fits grammatically before the verb phrase 'create a different future.'

Question:
A healthy forest is essential for ecological balance. It stores carbon, protects watersheds and supports biodiversity. Complete the passage by filling each blank with the most appropriate word or phrase.

Options:
ক. Fill the first blank (a): choose the correct relative pronoun or conjunction.
খ. Fill the second blank (b): choose the correct connector linking two independent qualities.
গ. Fill the third blank (c): choose the correct conditional conjunction.
ঘ. Fill the fourth blank (d): choose the best word to express exception/condition.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক which
খ and
গ if
ঘ unless

Explanation:
ক — which: The phrase describes the forest as a single entity and then adds a defining clause 'provides shelter to countless species', so the relative pronoun 'which' is appropriate.

খ — and: This links two independent positive qualities of the forest (e.g., it controls the climate and conserves water). 'And' is the simple coordinating conjunction that connects these balanced ideas.

গ — if: The clause warns about a conditional situation (when misuse leads to disturbance). 'If' introduces a real conditional: 'if people misuse it, the balance of nature is disturbed.'

ঘ — unless: This expresses an exception/negative condition for avoiding the bad outcome. 'Unless we act now' means 'if we do not act now', which fits the warning tone better than a plain 'if' here.

Options:
ক. Fill the first blank (a): choose the word that correctly refers to teachers who perform an action.
খ. Fill the second blank (b): choose the connector joining two effects of good teaching.
গ. Fill the third blank (c): choose the correct temporal conjunction.
ঘ. Fill the fourth blank (d): choose the conditional word that shows consequence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক who
খ and
গ when
ঘ if

Explanation:
ক — who: 'Teachers are mentors who guide students' requires a relative pronoun referring to people; 'who' is used for humans performing the action.

খ — and: Two positive outcomes ('they inspire curiosity' and 'they instill discipline') are being connected; the coordinating conjunction 'and' is appropriate.

গ — when: This introduces a time clause describing what happens at the moment students encounter difficulties. 'When students face challenges' expresses that temporal relationship.

ঘ — if: This sets up a conditional consequence: 'If the teacher becomes indifferent, learning suffers.' 'If' is the standard conditional introducing the result of that scenario.

Modern technology brings both convenience and risk. Fill in the blanks to make the passage logically and grammatically correct.

Options:
ক. Fill the first blank (a): choose the correct relative pronoun linking 'tools' to their function.
খ. Fill the second blank (b): choose the conditional word for potential misuse.
গ. Fill the third blank (c): choose the conjunction that introduces a condition about regulation.
ঘ. Fill the fourth blank (d): choose the best word to show that lack of awareness leads to problems.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক that
খ if
গ if
ঘ unless

Explanation:
ক — that: 'gadgets are tools that make life convenient' uses 'that' as the common relative pronoun for objects or things when giving essential information.

খ — if: The clause 'if they are misused' introduces a realistic conditional showing how misuse can lead to harm; 'if' is the correct choice.

গ — if: 'If governments regulate technology wisely' is a conditional clause stating the circumstance under which benefits will outweigh risks; 'if' is appropriate for this hypothetical or real condition.

ঘ — unless: This indicates a negative exception — 'unless users remain unaware, problems will multiply' means 'if users remain unaware, problems will multiply', but 'unless' is more concise and idiomatic to express the condition preventing a positive outcome.

Explanation:
ক: 'who' is the appropriate relative pronoun to link 'The farmer' with the verb phrase describing his action (The farmer who waits patiently...). খ: 'In fact,' is a discourse adverb used to stress the truth of the following generalisation (In fact, only with patience can people endure hardships). গ: 'In time,' expresses that something happens after a period and fits before 'many difficulties are resolved.' ঘ: 'therefore' draws a conclusion from the earlier points (Therefore we should practise patience).

Safety is paramount in the kitchen (d) ———— one must be cautious when handling hot oil and sharp knives.

Options:
ক. The head chef makes final decisions (a) ———— yet he listens to his team.
খ. An assistant may have personal ideas (b) ———— must follow kitchen protocols.
গ. Ingredients must be prepped carefully (c) ———— the dishes can be served on time.
ঘ. Safety is paramount in the kitchen (d) ———— one must be cautious when handling hot oil and sharp knives.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক however

খ but

গ so

ঘ therefore

Explanation:
ক (however): The sentence contrasts two facts: the chef makes final decisions but still listens. 'However' signals that contrast and fits the formal tone.

খ (but): The assistant's personal ideas are contrasted with the obligation to follow protocols. 'But' is the simple contrasting conjunction that fits best here.

গ (so): This blank expresses purpose/result — careful prep leads to timely service. 'So' indicates the result and reads naturally: 'prepped carefully so the dishes can be served on time.'

ঘ (therefore): This clause states a conclusion from the previous statement that safety is paramount. 'Therefore' links the general rule to the resulting obligation to be cautious when handling hazards.

Options:
ক. No one should speed recklessly (a) ———— there are pedestrians and cyclists.
খ. A motorist may prefer a particular route (b) ———— sometimes a detour is the safer option.
গ. Even when the law permits overtaking (c) ———— it must be done only if visibility and spacing allow.
ঘ. When visibility is poor or roads are wet (d) ———— reduce your speed and use headlights.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক because

খ however

গ yet

ঘ so

Explanation:
ক (because): The reason for not speeding is given — presence of pedestrians and cyclists. 'Because' explicitly states the cause.

খ (however): The sentence contrasts a personal preference with an alternative that can sometimes be safer; 'however' introduces that contrast.

গ (yet): This conjunction introduces a limitation despite the preceding statement. Even if overtaking is permitted, there is a contrasting condition: it must still be safe. 'Yet' expresses that contrast succinctly.

ঘ (so): This blank indicates the recommended action that follows from the condition (poor visibility/wet roads). 'So' links the condition to the advised consequence: reduce speed and use headlights.

ঘ. To improve future projects, teams should reflect on what went well (d) ———— learn from mistakes.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক as well as

খ but

গ then

ঘ so that

Explanation:
ক (as well as): The phrase pairs two complementary actions: sharing ideas and listening. 'As well as' connects them smoothly and emphasizes both are important.

খ (but): Deadlines and quality can conflict; 'but' presents the necessary contrast that while timely submission is important, quality shouldn't be compromised.

গ (then): This blank indicates a logical subsequent step after observing an imbalance in workload. 'Then' marks the appropriate response — discuss roles.

ঘ (so that): The purpose of reflecting is to achieve a result: learning from mistakes. 'So that' makes the purpose explicit and ties reflection to improvement.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a small, silver wristwatch lying on a wooden bench.খ the back was engraved with two initials and a tiny date.গ a folded scrap of paper with part of a name.ঘ to take the watch to the park office so that the owner could be traced.

Explanation:
ক: The blank (a) describes what was noticed. The phrase 'a small, silver wristwatch lying on a wooden bench' is concise and fits the scene; it uses the present participle 'lying' to show the watch's position. খ: Blank (b) continues the action of turning the watch over, so a clause describing what was seen on the back fits naturally: 'the back was engraved with two initials and a tiny date.' This is a simple past passive construction appropriate after 'found'. গ: Blank (c) specifies that there was no full contact information but there was something else: 'a folded scrap of paper with part of a name' describes this partial clue succinctly. ঘ: Blank (d) needs an infinitive phrase expressing intention or decision; 'to take the watch to the park office so that the owner could be traced' clearly states the actor's plan and purpose. Each filled phrase keeps the narrative coherent and grammatically consistent with the surrounding sentences.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক an envelope tucked beneath the seat.খ a short, hastily written letter along with two slips of train tickets.গ a penciled line that looked like a partial telephone number.ঘ to hand the envelope to the taxi company the next morning.

Explanation:
ক: The scene requires a phrase that identifies the object and location: 'an envelope tucked beneath the seat' is idiomatic and visually clear. খ: After opening the envelope, the narrator reports its contents; 'a short, hastily written letter along with two slips of train tickets' lists the items and conveys the hurried nature of the note. গ: Since there is no full address, a brief phrase describing the remaining clue fits: 'a penciled line that looked like a partial telephone number' explains why the envelope might still help identify the owner. ঘ: The narrator makes a practical decision; the infinitive phrase 'to hand the envelope to the taxi company the next morning' communicates intent and timing, and it aligns with normal procedures for lost property found in taxis.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a colourful scarf on a bus stop bench.খ the description matched exactly the one I had found.গ a small embroidered corner with the initials of its owner.ঘ to speak with her politely and asked whether she had lost such a scarf.

Explanation:
ক: The blank needs a short noun phrase naming the lost object and its location: 'a colourful scarf on a bus stop bench' is specific and sets up the later recognition. খ: When the woman mentions losing a scarf, the narrator recognizes it; thus 'the description matched exactly the one I had found' correctly conveys that realization. গ: To be certain, the narrative uses a small identifying detail; 'a small embroidered corner with the initials of its owner' is a realistic, distinctive mark that would confirm ownership. ঘ: The final blank must describe a courteous approach; 'to speak with her politely and asked whether she had lost such a scarf' states the narrator's action and tone, completing the incident logically and politely.

গ উত্তর: and so
ঘ উত্তর: so that

Explanation:
ক (blank a): 'as' introduces the reason why students behave that way — 'as they think more words mean better marks' reads naturally. খ (blank b): 'so' links the teachers' action with the purpose of their advice — 'so they advise concise structure'. গ (blank c): 'and so' indicates consequence — 'they ignore tips and so receive low grades.' Using just 'so' here would also work, but 'and so' mirrors the two-part clause. ঘ (blank d): 'so that' expresses purpose/result — 'practise planning ... so that your writing becomes precise and persuasive.'

Question:
In a small company many monthly reports are verbose and unclear. The managers complain (a) ———— the information is buried in too much narrative. Meetings are held frequently, (b) ———— staff are trained to use bullet points and headings. Some employees continue to write long paragraphs, (c) ———— their supervisors keep returning drafts for revision. If everyone follows the new format and edits carefully, (d) ———— the reports will be easier to review.

Options:
ক. Select the connector that best fits blank (a).
খ. Select the connector that best fits blank (b).
গ. Select the connector that best fits blank (c).
ঘ. Select the connector that best fits blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: because
খ উত্তর: whereupon
গ উত্তর: and hence
ঘ উত্তর: therefore

Explanation:
ক (blank a): 'because' gives the reason for managers' complaints: 'the information is buried...'. খ (blank b): 'whereupon' indicates what happened after meetings — staff are trained as a direct follow-up. 'So' could be used, but 'whereupon' emphasizes the sequence. গ (blank c): 'and hence' shows consequence — continuing to write long paragraphs leads to returned drafts. 'Hence' alone would also work. ঘ (blank d): 'therefore' signals the logical result if everyone follows the format — 'reports will be easier to review.'

Question:
During seminar practice most students ignore timing and include long introductions. The coach warns them, (a) ———— timing is crucial in presentations, you must practice under time limits. Several presenters still skip rehearsal, (b) ———— their slides run over and audiences lose interest. Some adopt rehearsal routines and edit ruthlessly, (c) ———— their sessions become crisp and engaging. Keep a clock handy (d) ———— you can adjust pace as you speak.

Options:
ক. Pick the connector suitable for blank (a).

ঘ. Pick the connector suitable for blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: since
খ উত্তর: so
গ উত্তর: and thus

Explanation:
ক (blank a): 'since' introduces a reason — 'since timing is crucial...' fits smoothly. খ (blank b): 'so' links skipping rehearsal to the immediate result — 'so their slides run over.' গ (blank c): 'and thus' shows the resulting improvement when students adopt rehearsal routines — 'and thus their sessions become crisp.' ঘ (blank d): 'so that' expresses purpose — keeping a clock aids pacing: 'so that you can adjust pace as you speak.'

Question:
Public education is the foundation of a healthy society; (a) ——- the reality in many regions is different. Non-profit organizations have started programs to support underserved schools (b) ——- their reach remains limited. Some experts propose policy reforms (c) ——- others emphasize community participation. (d) ——-, long-term improvement will demand cooperation among all stakeholders.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a) with a suitable connector.
খ. Fill blank (b) with a suitable connector.
গ. Fill blank (c) with a suitable connector.
ঘ. Fill blank (d) with a suitable connector.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক nevertheless
খ but
গ while
ঘ therefore

Explanation:
ক — "nevertheless" is appropriate because the sentence contrasts the general statement (education as foundation) with the opposing reality; it signals contrast similar to "however" or "nonetheless".

খ — "but" connects two clauses where the second clause limits or qualifies the first: non-profit programs exist, but their reach is limited.

গ — "while" introduces a contrast between two alternative viewpoints (experts proposing policy reforms versus those emphasizing community participation). "While" is preferable here because it parallels two simultaneous but differing positions.

ঘ — "therefore" indicates a logical consequence: because of the previously described mixture of limited programs and differing approaches, long-term improvement will demand cooperation; "therefore" properly signals that conclusion.

Question:
Plastic waste continues to endanger marine ecosystems; (a) ——- many people still prefer single-use items. Communities organize coastal cleanups (b) ——- the amount removed is small compared with what enters the seas each year. Governments suggest bans and incentives, (c) ——- some manufacturers cite higher production costs. (d) ——-, meaningful change requires policy, corporate responsibility, and consumer awareness.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a) with a suitable connector.
খ. Fill blank (b) with a suitable connector.
গ. Fill blank (c) with a suitable connector.
ঘ. Fill blank (d) with a suitable connector.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক yet
খ however
গ while
ঘ consequently

Explanation:
ক — "yet" contrasts the seriousness of the problem with continued personal behavior; it works like "however" or "still" in this context.

খ — "however" is used to introduce a statement that contrasts with the previous clause: although communities clean up coasts, the cleanup's scale is insufficient.

গ — "while" introduces a contrast between government proposals and manufacturers' objections; it shows two concurrent but opposing situations.

ঘ — "consequently" shows the result or implication of the preceding facts: because of the scale of the problem and conflicting responses, meaningful change requires combined efforts; "consequently" appropriately signals that outcome.

Question:
Remote work has boosted productivity in many firms (a) ——- it has blurred the boundary between work and personal life. Some employees report improved flexibility and well-being (b) ——- others experience social isolation. Companies organize virtual events (c) ——- these efforts cannot fully replace face-to-face contact. (d) ——-, a balanced hybrid policy may address both productivity and employee welfare.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a) with a suitable connector.
খ. Fill blank (b) with a suitable connector.
গ. Fill blank (c) with a suitable connector.
ঘ. Fill blank (d) with a suitable connector.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক but
খ while
গ however
ঘ therefore

Explanation:
ক — "but" contrasts the productivity gains with the negative side effect of blurred boundaries; it's the simplest connector to show opposition between clauses.

খ — "while" contrasts two differing experiences among employees occurring at the same time: some enjoy benefits, while others feel isolated.

গ — "however" introduces a limitation to the previous positive action (virtual events) by stating they don't fully substitute in-person contact.

ঘ — "therefore" draws the logical conclusion: given the mixed outcomes and imperfect solutions, a balanced hybrid policy is the reasonable result. "Therefore" correctly signals this inference.

Question:
Habits determine destiny. The following fragments are parts of a single proverb-like sentence: (a) — small actions repeated daily (b) — build the character (c) — and shape the future (d) — with gradual effect.

Options:
ক. Fragments (a)–(d) are given. Arrange them in the order that forms a coherent sentence.
খ. Which fragment functions primarily as a noun phrase?
গ. Which fragment expresses outcome or consequence?
ঘ. Write the final coherent sentence formed by these fragments in one polished line.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Order: (a) → (b) → (c) → (d). So the fragments combine as: "small actions repeated daily build the character and shape the future with gradual effect." খ Answer: (a) — "small actions repeated daily". This is a noun phrase acting as the subject. গ Answer: (c) — "and shape the future" (together with (d) "with gradual effect" adds the consequence). These fragments indicate the resulting effect of the subject's actions. ঘ Polished sentence: "Small actions repeated daily build character and, with gradual effect, shape the future."

Explanation:
ক — The natural logical flow is to introduce the subject (a), then state what it does (b), then add the outcome (c) and qualify its manner (d). That yields a clear, grammatical sentence. 

খ — Fragment (a) contains the head noun and modifiers, so it functions as the subject/noun phrase. 

গ — The idea of consequence is captured by (c) ("shape the future"), and (d) specifies how that consequence occurs (gradually). 

ঘ — The polished sentence reorders punctuation slightly (comma around the adverbial phrase) for readability while preserving the intended meaning: small repeated actions lead to long-term change.

Question:
Knowledge without application is empty. Consider these fragments: (a) — reading without practice (b) — is like a lamp unlit (c) — and ideas without action (d) — remain mere dreams.

Options:
ক. Arrange the fragments to form a balanced, meaningful sentence.
খ. Identify which fragment contains a simile.
গ. Which two fragments pair to make the second parallel clause?
ঘ. Rewrite the complete sentence in one elegant line.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Order: (a) → (b), (c) → (d), connected by a comma and 'and': "reading without practice is like a lamp unlit, and ideas without action remain mere dreams." খ Answer: (b) — "is like a lamp unlit". This fragment explicitly uses "like", forming a simile. গ Answer: (c) and (d) — "ideas without action" (c) pairs with "remain mere dreams" (d) to form the second parallel clause. ঘ Polished sentence: "Reading without practice is like a lamp unlit, and ideas without action remain mere dreams."

Explanation:
ক — The sentence is naturally two parallel clauses contrasting two forms of unused knowledge: the first clause (a+b) presents one image, the second clause (c+d) presents a parallel image. Using a comma and 'and' links the two. 

খ — Similes compare using words like 'like' or 'as'; fragment (b) contains 'is like', so it is the simile. 

গ — The fragments (c) and (d) logically belong together: subject phrase then its predicate. 

ঘ — The polished version keeps the parallelism and rhythm, making the contrast clear and memorable.

Question:
Time is the only irretrievable resource. Fragments: (a) — procrastination steals hours (b) — planning preserves moments (c) — a lost hour never returns (d) — seize the day.

Options:
ক. Which fragment is an imperative (a command)?
খ. Select two fragments that naturally form a cause–effect statement.
গ. Arrange the fragments to make a short three-part maxim: general truth, supporting example, then imperative.
ঘ. Combine all fragments into one polished proverb-like sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: (d) — "seize the day." This is an imperative verb phrase instructing action. খ Answer: (a) and (c) form a cause–effect relationship: "procrastination steals hours" (cause) → "a lost hour never returns" (effect/result). গ Order for a three-part maxim: (c) → (a) → (d). That is, start with the general truth (c), give an illustrative consequence (a), then give the command (d). For example: "A lost hour never returns; procrastination steals hours; seize the day." ঘ Polished combined proverb: "A lost hour never returns; procrastination steals time, so plan wisely and seize the day."

Explanation:
ক — Imperatives are direct commands; fragment (d) is one. 

খ — (a) states how time is lost through delay; (c) states the permanence of that loss — together they read as cause and irreversible consequence. 

গ — To make a memorable maxim, open with the general truth (the universal statement about lost time), follow with the concrete behavior that causes loss, and finish with the exhortation. This ordering emphasizes why the command matters. 

ঘ — The final version smooths transitions (adds 'so' and 'plan wisely') to link cause and remedy while keeping the proverb-like tone. It also merges (b) by implying planning ('plan wisely') as the antidote to procrastination.

Question:
A true leader is judged (a) — by the applause received during success but (b) — by the steadiness shown in adversity. Leaders who listen (c) — to criticism and act (d) —, earn lasting respect from their teams.

Options:
ক. (a) — Choose the best phrase to complete the sentence.
খ. (b) — Choose the best phrase to complete the sentence.
গ. (c) — Choose the best phrase to complete the sentence.
ঘ. (d) — Choose the best phrase to complete the sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক not merely
খ rather
গ attentively
ঘ accordingly

Explanation:
ক: 'not merely' is appropriate because the sentence contrasts two standards of judgment — applause in success versus steadiness in adversity; 'not merely' introduces that contrast.
খ: 'rather' fits to correct the contrast started by 'not merely'; it shifts emphasis to the second criterion.
গ: 'attentively' correctly modifies 'listen' showing the manner in which leaders receive criticism; other adverbs like 'silently' or 'begrudgingly' would change meaning.
ঘ: 'accordingly' indicates that leaders act in a manner consistent with the criticism they received; it ties reaction to the input and completes the thought logically.
Overall explanation: The paragraph compares superficial praise with deeper qualities. Words chosen create a coherent contrast (not merely... rather), specify the manner of receiving feedback (attentively), and show the related response (accordingly), yielding a fluent, idiomatic passage.

Question:

Options:
ক. (a) — Choose the best word/phrase to complete the sentence.
খ. (b) — Choose the best word/phrase to complete the sentence.
গ. (c) — Choose the best word/phrase to complete the sentence.
ঘ. (d) — Choose the best word/phrase to complete the sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক not only
খ closely
গ after
ঘ and patience

Explanation:
ক: 'not only' introduces that the value isn't limited to immediate beauty and invites an additional idea; 'only' alone would negate the following clause.
খ: 'closely' is the adverb that conveys careful observation required to notice technique and meaning; alternative adverbs like 'briefly' would contradict the intended idea.
গ: 'after' fits: 'Critics may judge after a quick glance' would be wrong; here 'may judge after a quick glance' would imply critics sometimes judge based on a quick look. However in original order 'Critics may judge (c) — a quick glance' the correct insertion is 'after' or 'from' — we chose 'after' to express that they form judgment following only a quick glance.
ঘ: 'and patience' completes the idea that professional assessment requires both time and patience to perceive subtleties. The phrase balances the earlier adverb 'closely' and emphasizes duration and temperament.
Overall explanation: The sentence contrasts superficial appraisal with deeper evaluation. 'Not only' sets a two-part structure; 'closely' and 'and patience' describe how to properly evaluate, while 'after' conveys that some critics form judgments prematurely.

Options:
ক. (a) — Fill the best phrase to complete the idea.
খ. (b) — Fill the best phrase to complete the idea.
গ. (c) — Fill the best phrase to complete the idea.
ঘ. (d) — Fill the best phrase to complete the idea.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক primarily
খ rigorously
গ provisional
ঘ therefore

Explanation:
ক: 'primarily' indicates the main criterion for a theory's survival — empirical testing — and sets the emphasis correctly.
খ: 'rigorously' describes the necessary thoroughness and strictness of testing a hypothesis; it strengthens the idea of repeated, careful trials.
গ: 'provisional' accurately characterizes scientific acceptance as tentative and open to revision; 'final' would contradict the subsequent clause.
ঘ: 'therefore' links the idea that because acceptance is provisional and subject to future refinement, scientific progress is cumulative; it provides a logical conclusion.
Overall explanation: The passage explains the scientific method: theories are upheld mainly through strict testing. Even well-supported theories remain provisional, and this tentativeness implies that science builds progressively. The chosen words reflect standard scientific epistemology (primarily, rigorously, provisional, therefore) and maintain logical coherence across the sentences.

Explanation:
ক (so): The sentence before the blank states that news spreads faster; 'so' correctly links this cause to the effect that anyone can see live footage. খ (through which): We need a relative phrase that connects 'channels' with how voices reach audiences; 'through which' is the correct formal connector. গ (so): The contrast sentence warns about reliability; 'so' shows the result that users must verify sources. ঘ (While): The sentence expresses a contrast between benefits and demands of technology; 'While' appropriately introduces this concessive relation ('While technology connects us, it also demands critical thinking').

খ. Fill blank (b) with the best word from the box.
গ. Fill blank (c) with the best word from the box.
ঘ. Fill blank (d) with the best word from the box.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: with

খ উত্তর: because

গ উত্তর: unless

ঘ উত্তর: despite

Explanation:
ক: Although 'with' is not in the original boxed list for this item, the most suitable connector to express the means is 'with experience'—however, since 'with' wasn't listed in this second box, the best match from the provided list is 'before' is incorrect; correct intended choice is 'with' meaning 'as a result of experience'. (Note: if strictly limited to the box, 'over' isn't available—so 'with' is used to convey the idea.)

খ: 'Because most people fear the podium, practice and feedback help.' This pairs cause and effect: fear motivates the need for practice. (Alternatively one might write 'although', but 'because' fits the clause given.)

গ: 'Unless you avoid preparation, anxiety will increase' logically: if you do not prepare, anxiety goes up—so 'unless' sets the conditional negative.

ঘ: 'Despite the difficulty, many find they improve.' 'Despite' expresses contrast—improvement happens in spite of difficulty.

Overall, each word was chosen to match meaning (cause, condition, contrast, means) and correct grammar in the sentence context.

Question:
Words in box: by, through, as, while, so that, unless, until, although

Passage: Learning to solve problems happens (a) — steady practice. (b) — tutors explain methods, students should also attempt problems independently. (c) — you keep working, progress will come. (d) — you understand every step immediately, persevere and revisit ideas.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a) with the best word from the box.
খ. Fill blank (b) with the best word from the box.
গ. Fill blank (c) with the best word from the box.
ঘ. Fill blank (d) with the best word from the box.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: through

খ উত্তর: while

গ উত্তর: as

ঘ উত্তর: although

Explanation:
ক (through): 'Learning ... happens through steady practice'—'through' indicates the means or process by which learning takes place. খ (while): 'While tutors explain methods, students should also attempt problems independently' contrasts simultaneous actions and suggests balance between listening and doing. গ (as): 'As you keep working, progress will come' uses 'as' to mean 'while' or 'because over the time that'—it fits the temporal/causal sense. ঘ (although): 'Although you may not understand every step immediately, persevere...'—'although' introduces a concession, encouraging perseverance despite incomplete immediate understanding. Each choice matches grammatical form and intended logical relationship in the sentence.

Question:
Many employees arrive late at the office. (a) ———— they miss morning briefings, the workflow becomes disorganized. Management has noticed that, (b) ———— they are given flexible hours, some staff still fail to be punctual. The supervisors remind everyone (c) ———— deadlines must be met, but productivity remains low. To improve the situation, the company has issued new guidelines (d) ———— employees manage their time better.

Options:
ক. Choose the best linking word for blank (a).
খ. Choose the best linking word for blank (b).
গ. Choose the best linking word for blank (c).
ঘ. Choose the best linking word for blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক because
খ although
গ that
ঘ so that

Explanation:
ক — 'because' links the reason (they miss morning briefings) to the consequence (the workflow becomes disorganized). It correctly expresses cause-and-effect.
খ — 'although' introduces a contrast: despite flexible hours, punctuality problems persist. 'While' could also work, but 'although' emphasizes the unexpected contrast.
গ — 'that' is used here to introduce the content of the supervisors' reminder: 'remind everyone that deadlines must be met.' It is the correct complementizer for reported content.
ঘ — 'so that' expresses purpose: the guidelines were issued with the goal of helping employees manage their time better. 'In order to' would also be correct, but 'so that' fits smoothly in the sentence structure.

Explanation:

খ — 'although' introduces a contrast: despite illness of key members, the team still performed well. This signals unexpected outcome in spite of the setback.
গ — 'so that' introduces the intended result or benefit of practicing more: improvement of performance.
ঘ — 'so that' here expresses purpose: extra sessions are planned with the aim that everyone will gain more confidence. 'In order that' would also work but is more formal.

Question:
Punctuality is an important habit. The student (a) — arrives on time always wins the teacher's trust. To be punctual one should prepare the night before (b) — avoid last-minute rush. Sometimes unforeseen events happen (c) — we must inform those who wait for us. (d) — punctual people are respected in society.

Options:
ক. Fill in blank (a) with the most appropriate word or phrase.
খ. Fill in blank (b) with the most appropriate word or phrase.
গ. Fill in blank (c) with the most appropriate word or phrase.
ঘ. Fill in blank (d) with the most appropriate word or phrase.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক who arrives on time always wins the teacher's trust. খ the night before to avoid last-minute rush. গ when unforeseen events happen — we must inform those who wait for us. ঘ Thus punctual people are respected in society.

Explanation:
ক: 'who' is the correct relative pronoun to introduce a clause that describes 'the student'. The phrase becomes 'The student who arrives on time...'. খ: 'the night before' is the time expression; the sentence needs a prepositional phrase 'prepare the night before to avoid...'. The blank expects 'the' + time phrase rather than a conjunction. গ: 'when' fits to show the time/condition under which we should inform others; it connects the clause about unforeseen events to the main clause. Another acceptable connector could be 'if', but 'when' emphasizes the occurrence. ঘ: 'Thus' or 'Therefore' expresses the conclusion that follows from the previous statements; it links punctual behavior to societal respect.

Question:
Planting trees helps the environment. If people (a) — plant more trees, urban heat will be reduced. Trees not only give shade (b) — absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Planting requires patience (c) — the full benefits appear after years. (d) — we must encourage tree planting in schools and communities.

Options:
ক. Choose the best word/phrase for blank (a).
খ. Choose the best word/phrase for blank (b).
গ. Choose the best word/phrase for blank (c).
ঘ. Choose the best word/phrase for blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক who plant more trees, urban heat will be reduced. খ and absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. গ because the full benefits appear after years. ঘ Therefore we must encourage tree planting in schools and communities.

Explanation:
ক: 'who' is the correct relative pronoun linking 'people' with the action 'plant more trees' — 'people who plant more trees...'. খ: 'and' connects the two functions of trees (give shade and absorb CO2); a coordinating conjunction is needed. গ: 'because' introduces the reason why patience is needed (the benefits take years); it correctly links cause and effect. ঘ: 'Therefore' is used to draw a recommendation or conclusion from the prior facts — that we should promote planting.

Even if books are expensive (c) — libraries and digital resources can help. (d) — parents and teachers should foster a reading habit early.

Options:

গ. Pick the correct connector/word for blank (c).
ঘ. Pick the correct connector/word for blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক who reads every day develops stronger vocabulary. খ because it introduces new ideas and perspectives. গ so libraries and digital resources can help. ঘ Hence parents and teachers should foster a reading habit early.

Explanation:
ক: 'who' correctly forms a relative clause describing 'a child' and their habitual action: 'A child who reads every day...'. খ: 'because' explains how reading broadens the mind — it gives the reason (introducing new ideas and perspectives). গ: 'so' indicates a result or solution to the problem of expensive books; libraries and digital sources are therefore helpful. ঘ: 'Hence' (or 'Therefore') signals the conclusion/recommendation that follows: adults should encourage reading from an early age.
