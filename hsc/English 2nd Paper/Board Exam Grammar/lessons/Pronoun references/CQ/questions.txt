A cook once roasted a duck for its master. He looked so delicious that he could not resist the temptation and ate up one of the drumsticks. When he sat down to eat the meal, he quickly noticed the missing leg. He asked him what had happened to the other leg. The cook told him that it had one leg only.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A cook once roasted a duck for his master. The roast looked so delicious that the cook could not resist the temptation and ate up one of the drumsticks. When the master sat down to eat the meal, he quickly noticed the missing leg. He asked the cook what had happened to the other leg. The cook told him that the duck had one leg only. The master said that there was no such thing as a one-legged duck but the cook insisted that every duck had only one leg.

Explanation:
The cook used the word "duck" to mean a single serving or half the roasted bird, not the whole animal: each served portion had only one drumstick. The master misunderstood the reference, so the cook's statement is true when "duck" refers to a portion rather than the entire bird.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Mandela left public life in June 2004 telling his adoring countrymen not to call him . Regarding him . Nadine Gordimer said, " Mandela is at the epicenter of his time, ours in South Africa and yours , wherever you are."

Explanation:
Use "him" instead of "them" because Mandela is a single male person, so the singular object pronoun "him" is grammatically correct. In Gordimer's sentence the words should be "ours" and "yours" (not "our" and "your") because they are possessive pronouns standing alone to mean "our epicentre" and "your epicentre."

Solution:
Education is the birthright of every man. But even then many people in our country are deprived of education/ this right for many reasons. They are unconscious and unskilled for want of education . For this unconsciousness and unskilledness , they are unable not only to develop their own fate or their family, but also unable to play any role for the development of society or the state. If the people are not properly educated, the development of society or the state is not possible. So, the more we can educate our people, the more the country will be developed. With a view to developing human resource, the government has given many incentives in the field of expanding the primary and secondary education. We must ensure these Incentives for every child of the country.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer is right because education builds human capital—educated people gain skills, awareness and productivity that improve their own lives and contribute to family and national development. When many are deprived of schooling they remain unskilled and unable to participate in social or economic progress, so expanding access removes that barrier. Government incentives for primary and secondary education aim to ensure every child can get these benefits, which in turn promotes overall development.

Storm causes harm to them. The house roofs are blown away. Many trees are uprooted. A large number of houses and shelters are damaged within a very short time. Standing crops are badly damaged That is thus a dreadful night to the people.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer is right because the passage gives clear evidence—roaring wind, frequent thunder and lightning, uprooted trees, blown roofs and damaged crops—that the storm brings both terror and physical destruction. This shows the main idea: the night is dreadful due to frightening sounds and real harm caused by the storm, and the specific details support that general conclusion.

Question:
Women are nowadays as important as men in society. She constitute nearly half of our total population. No nation can make real progress keeping half of it in the darkness. Without the uplift of women, it is not at all possible. Again, without education, women cannot be uplifted. So, proper education should be given to her so that they can work hand in hand with them in all development programmes.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: The answer is correct because women constitute nearly half the population, so keeping them uneducated or backward prevents a nation from achieving full progress. Education uplifts and empowers women to participate equally in development programmes, making inclusive growth and social advancement possible.

Question:
On a summer day, becoming very thirsty, a lion and a boar came at the same moment to a small well to drink. Those fiercely quarrelled which of them should drink first, and were soon engaged in a mortal fighting. On his stopping on a sudden to take breath for renewal of the fighting, it saw some vultures waiting in the distance to feast on the one which should fall first. They at once stopped the quarrel, saying. “That is better for us to make friends than to become the food of crows or vultures, as will certainly happen if ourselves are disabled.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
They stop fighting because they realize that if they injure each other they will become easy prey for the vultures waiting to feed on the fallen, so making peace preserves their lives. The underlying idea is practical self‑preservation: when a greater external danger threatens both parties, cooperation or compromise is wiser than continuing a fight that could lead to mutual ruin.

Question:
Life is full of struggles. These are quite normal in anyone’s life as it is not a bed of roses. Certainly, it has ups and downs. A man has to face innumerable barriers in his life. Sometimes he can overcome those but sometimes he fails to combat them. He may be born with silver spoon without any trouble. But even then he has to overcome a lot of such to be successful in life. In other words, life is full of challenges. If he cannot fight them successfully, his life becomes full of sorrows. Though the scholars differ in giving the definition of life, they are unanimous that obstacles are the ways of life. In fact, a man has to undergo many in his life.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Life is full of struggles. These are quite normal in anyone’s life as life is not a bad of roses. Certainly, life has ups and downs. A man has to face innumerable barriers in his life. Sometimes he can overcome those barriers but sometimes he fails to combat them. He may be born with silver spoon without any trouble. But even then he has to overcome a lot of troubles to be successful in life. In other words, life is full of challenges. If he cannot fight the challenges successfully, his life becomes full of sorrows. Though the scholars differ in giving the definition of life, they are unanimous that obstacles are the ways of life. In fact, a man has to undergo many in his life.

Explanation:
The passage repeatedly states that life “is not a bed of roses,” has ups and downs, and that obstacles are inevitable, so the correct answer (that life is full of challenges) follows directly from these statements. The example about even the privileged facing problems and the scholars’ agreement support this main idea, showing that struggles are normal and determine whether life brings success or sorrow.

Question:
Robin hates people who are mean to animals. Last afternoon, as he was walking home from work he saw some boys throwing stones at an old lame dog. Immediately, he rushed to help the animal “Stop it!” he shouted as he ran towards the unruly boys, “Leave him alone!” Startled by the big man’s shouts, they ran away. One of them jeered at him while running away Robin, however, was totally unmoved by the jeering. He was happy that he could save it. Robin has always felt some affection for animals. Once he even went to the police station to complain about a neighbour who threw a cat out of the window. Instead of taking any action, they laughed at him advised him not to worry about such ‘petty’ matters.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Robin hates people who are mean to animals. Yesterday afternoon, as he was walking home from work, he saw some boys throwing stones at an old lame dog. Immediately, he rushed to help the animal. "Stop it!" he shouted as he ran towards the unruly boys. "Leave it alone!"

Startled by the big man's shouts, the boys ran away. One of them jeered at Robin while running away. Robin, however, was totally unmoved by the jeering. He was happy that he could save it. Robin has always felt some affection for animals. Once he even went to the police station to complain about a neighbour who threw a cat out of the window. Instead of taking any action, the police laughed at him and advised him not to worry about such 'petty' matters.

Explanation:
The correct answer is right because Robin’s immediate action to stop the boys, his prior complaint to the police about the cat, and his lack of concern for the jeering all show consistent compassion and courage toward animals. From these details we infer his character—kindness and bravery—by observing his repeated behavior and reactions in different situations. This teaches that we determine personality traits by noting a person’s actions and consistent responses.

Question:
When we travel with respect for local culture, travel becomes more meaningful. Many tourists act without thinking about local rules or the environment. Responsible travelers pick up litter, use less plastic and learn local customs. Small acts by many travelers can protect fragile habitats and keep traditions alive.

Options:
ক. উক্ত অনুচ্ছেদটি একটি সরকারি বা একাডেমিক সুরে পুনরায় লিখুন (formal tone)।
খ. অনুচ্ছেদে থাকা দুর্বল ক্রিয়া বা বিশেষণগুলোকে শক্তিশালী বিকল্পে পরিবর্তন করে পুনরায় লিখুন (আরো স্পষ্ট ও প্রভাবশালী শব্দ ব্যবহার করুন)।
গ. এই অনুচ্ছেদটির ২০ শব্দের একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত সারাংশ লিখুন।
ঘ. টেকসই ভ্রমণ বিষয়ে একটি প্রলোভনমূলক সূচনা বাক্য লিখুন (একটি প্রবন্ধের প্রথম লাইন হিসাবে ব্যবহারযোগ্য)।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক When travelers observe and respect local cultures, travel acquires greater significance. Numerous visitors act without adequate consideration for local regulations or environmental consequences. Responsible travelers collect litter, minimize plastic consumption, and study local customs. Collective modest actions by travelers can safeguard fragile ecosystems and preserve traditional practices.

খ When travelers conscientiously respect local culture, travel becomes profoundly meaningful. Many tourists behave thoughtlessly toward local norms and the environment. Responsible travelers actively collect litter, significantly reduce plastic use, and diligently learn local customs. Small, consistent actions by numerous travelers can protect vulnerable habitats and sustain living traditions.

গ Respectful, responsible travelers protect ecosystems and traditions through small, consistent actions during their journeys.

ঘ Embrace sustainable travel: respect local customs, reduce your footprint, and help preserve cultures and ecosystems wherever you go.

Explanation:
ক: একাডেমিক সুর অর্জন করতে 'observe and respect', 'acquires greater significance', 'adequate consideration' ও 'environmental consequences' মত কথাবার্তা ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে; বাক্যগঠন আরও নান্দনিক ও আনুষ্ঠানিক করা হয়েছে।

খ: দুর্বল ক্রিয়াসমূহ (e.g., 'act without thinking') শক্তিশালী ক্রিয়া ও বিবরণের মাধ্যমে (e.g., 'behave thoughtlessly', 'actively collect', 'significantly reduce') প্রতিস্থাপন করা হয়েছে যাতে বাক্যটি আরো প্রভাবশালী হয়।

গ: ২০-শব্দের সারাংশে মূল ভাবটি সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে তুলে ধরা হয়েছে — শ্রদ্ধাশীল ভ্রমণকারীরা ছোট কাজের মাধ্যমে পরিবেশ ও সংস্কৃতি রক্ষা করে।

ঘ: সূচনা বাক্যটি প্রলোভনমূলক ও কার্যকর করার উদ্দেশ্যে নির্মিত; এটি প্রবন্ধের প্রথম লাইন হিসেবে পাঠকের আগ্রহ জাগাবে এবং টোন স্থাপন করবে।

Question:
Public transport can teach patience and help reduce pollution. Many people prefer cars because it is faster and more comfortable. But buses and trains carry many people at once, save fuel and lower traffic. Sometimes buses are crowded and delayed; still they remain an economical option for most citizens.

Options:
ক. উপরের অনুচ্ছেদটি ব্যাকরণগতভাবে সঠিক করে পুনরায় লিখুন।
খ. প্রথম দুইটি বাক্যকে একটি জটিল বাক্য করে লিখুন।
গ. উক্ত অনুচ্ছেদ থেকে একটি সক্রিয়, প্রলোভনমূলক বাক্য (একটি বাচানো বাক্য) লিখুন যা জনসাধারণকে গণপরিবহন ব্যবহার করতে উৎসাহিত করবে।
ঘ. অনুচ্ছেদে থাকা দুটি ব্যাকরণগত বা বানানগত ত্রুটি চিহ্নিত করে সংশোধন লিখুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Public transport can teach patience and help reduce pollution. Many people prefer cars because they are faster and more comfortable. Buses and trains, however, carry many people at once, save fuel, and reduce traffic. Sometimes buses are crowded and delayed; still, they remain an economical option for most citizens.

খ Although many people prefer cars because they are faster and more comfortable, public transport can teach patience and help reduce pollution.

গ Choose buses and trains today to save money, cut pollution, and enjoy a calmer, more connected commute.

ঘ Error 1: 'it is faster and more comfortable' → subject–verb agreement and pronoun number: should be 'they are faster and more comfortable' (referring to cars). Error 2: 'lower traffic' is awkward verb usage; better: 'reduce traffic.'

Explanation:
ক: সংশোধনের সময় জায়গাজায়গি কৌমা ও সাবজেক্ট–ভিবাগের মিল ঠিক রাখা হয়েছে। 'cars' বহুবচন হওয়ায় প্রতিশব্দ 'they' ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে। 'reduce traffic' শব্দগুচ্ছটি ইংরেজিতে প্রাকৃতিক ও সঠিক।

খ: জটিল বাক্য গঠনের উদ্দেশ্য হলো কনট্রাস্ট ও কারণ-কারণিকতা একত্রে দেখানো — তাই 'Although' দিয়ে শুরু করে কারণ ও ফল এক বাক্যে মিলিত করা হয়েছে।

গ: প্রলোভনমূলক সক্রিয় বাক্যটি সরাসরি পাঠককে উদ্দেশ্য করে তৈরি করা হয়েছে, ক্রিয়াশীল (imperative) রূপে — এটি আচরণ পরিবর্তনে কার্যকর।

ঘ: প্রথম ত্রুটিটি pronoun-agreement; দ্বিতীয়টি collocation—'lower traffic' সাধারণত ব্যবহৃত না হওয়ায় 'reduce traffic' সঠিক।

ঘ. এই প্যারা-টেক্সটের জন্য একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত, ৫-শব্দের শিরোনাম দিন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Travel does not only mean moving from one place to another; it opens minds, reveals different ways of living, and teaches new skills. Some people think travel is a waste of money or time, while others believe that traveling makes them wiser and more tolerant. By visiting cities, villages, museums, and markets, one can learn lessons that are not found in books.

খ Travels do not only mean moving from one place to another; they open our minds, reveal different ways of living, and teach new skills. Some people think travel is a waste of money or time, while others believe that traveling makes them wiser and more tolerant. By visiting cities, villages, museums, and markets, we can learn lessons that are not found in books.

গ Moving from one place to another is not only what is meant by travel; minds are opened, different ways of living are revealed, and new skills are taught. It is thought by some that travel is a waste of money or time, while it is believed by others that wisdom and tolerance are gained through travel. Lessons that are not found in books can be learned by visiting cities, villages, museums, and markets.

ঘ Title: Travel Teaches Beyond the Classroom

Explanation:
ক: মূল ডিজাইন বজায় রেখে বাক্য গঠন, কৌমা ও সেমিকোলন সঠিক করা হয়েছে; 'reveals different ways of living' এবং 'teaches new skills' এ সমান্তরাল কাঠামো ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে। 'not found in books' হল প্রাকৃতিক ও সংক্ষিপ্ত সমাপনী অংশ।

খ: এখানে একবচন 'one' এবং ব্যক্তিগত একবচন বদলে বহুবচন 'we'/'they' ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে যাতে বাক্যটা সাধারণ মানুষকে নির্দেশ করে। প্রণালীগত ভাবে সকল অংশকে বহুবচনে খাপ খাইয়ে নেওয়া হয়েছে (e.g., 'one can learn' → 'we can learn')।

গ: প্যাসিভ রূপে রূপান্তরের সময় ক্রিয়ার সাবজেক্ট–অবজেক্ট সম্পর্ক বজায় রাখা হয়েছে এবং যেখানে প্রয়োজন 'is thought by some'/'is believed by others' ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে — এগুলো প্যাসিভ কনস্ট্রাকশনের সাবধানে প্রয়োগ।

ঘ: সংক্ষিপ্ত শিরোনামটি মূল পয়েন্ট — যে ভ্রমণ পাঠশালার বাইরেও শেখায় — কে পাঁচটি শব্দে পরিষ্কারভাবে প্রকাশ করে।

Question:
When Archbishop Desmond Tutu retired from public engagements in 2010 telling his adoring countrymen not to call them. About it, J. M. Coetzee wrote, “He is at the centre of his age our conscience in South Africa and yours, wherever you are”.

Options:
ক. প্রথম বাক্যে ভুল পদের সর্বনাম সংশোধন কর।
খ. উদ্ধৃতিতে অনুপস্থিত যে চিহ্ন ও শব্দগুলো দরকার সেগুলো যোগ কর।
গ. উপরের দুই বাক্যসহ সম্পূর্ণ অনুচ্ছেদটি সঠিকভাবে পুনরায় লেখ।
ঘ. Coetzee'র মন্তব্য 'He is at the centre of his age'—এর বিমূর্ত অর্থ সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা কর।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: প্রথম বাক্যে 'them' শব্দটি ভুল সর্বনাম; এটি 'him' হবে, কারণ বাক্যের রেফারেন্স আর্কবিশপ Desmond Tutu (একজবন পুরুষ)। তাই: "...telling his adoring countrymen not to call him."  

খ উত্তর: উদ্ধৃতিতে প্রয়োজন কিছু কেমা ও একটি সারিবদ্ধতা বদল: মূল উদ্ধৃতিটি থেকে অনুপস্থিত কমা ও যুগ্ম বাক্য বিভক্ত করা দরকার। সঠিক রূপ হতে পারে: “He is at the centre of his age: our conscience in South Africa, and yours, wherever you are.”  

গ উত্তর: সম্পূর্ণ সংশোধিত অনুচ্ছেদ: "When Archbishop Desmond Tutu retired from public engagements in 2010, telling his adoring countrymen not to call him. About it, J. M. Coetzee wrote, "He is at the centre of his age: our conscience in South Africa, and yours, wherever you are.""  

ঘ উত্তর: Coetzee'র মন্তব্যের অর্থ: তিনি বোঝাতে চেয়েছেন যে টুটু ঐ সময়ের নৈতিক কেন্দ্র — দক্ষিণ আফ্রিকার সমাজের নৈতিক স্বরূপ (our conscience) হিসেবে, এবং বিদেশে থাকা মানুষের জন্যও—একধরনের আয়না বা প্রতিফলক (yours) হিসেবে। সংক্ষেপে, তিনি ঐ যুগের নৈতিক মুখপাত্র ও দৃষ্টান্ত হিসেবে দাঁড়িয়েছেন।

Explanation:
ক: সর্বনাম সংশোধনের নিয়ম অনুযায়ী, যখন একজন নির্দিষ্ট পুরুষ ব্যক্তিকে নির্দেশ করা হচ্ছে তখন 'him' ব্যবহার করা সঠিক। এখানে 'them' অনানুষ্ঠানিক বহুবচন বা নিরপেক্ষ সর্বনাম; কিন্তু কনটেক্সটে এটি ভুল।  

খ: উদ্ধৃতিটি দুটি ধারণা একত্রে বহন করছে—একটি প্রধান বক্তব্য (He is at the centre of his age) এবং দুটি উপসংহার (our conscience..., and yours...). একটি ডবলবিন্দু বা ব্যাকরণগত বিরতি এবং কামের প্রয়োগ বাক্যকে পাঠযোগ্য করে।  

গ: সম্পূর্ণ অনুচ্ছেদ পুনর্লিখনের সময় ক্রমানুসারে বিরামচিহ্ন এবং উদ্ধৃতি সঠিকভাবে বসানো হয়েছে যাতে অর্থ পরিষ্কার থাকে।  

ঘ: 'centre of his age' একটি মেটাফোর; এটি সময়ের মূল মনোভাব বা নৈতিক ধুমকেতু নির্দেশ করে — অর্থাৎ ঐ ব্যক্তির কর্ম ও বচন ঐ যুগের নৈতিক নির্দেশক হিসেবে কাজ করেছে।

ঘ. ‘fulcrum of her generation’ এই রূপকটির বাংলা অর্থ এবং এখানে এর ব্যবহার কেন কার্যকর তা ব্যখ্যা করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: প্রথম বাক্যে কয়েকটি সংশোধন প্রয়োজন: বড় হাতের অক্ষর, কামের ব্যবহার এবং সার্বনাম। সঠিকরূপ: "In 1992 the activist announced she would step away from politics, saying to supporters, 'Don't phone me.'"  

খ উত্তর: উদ্ধৃতিটি পাঠভঙ্গিমা ও চিহ্নসহ: "She stands at the fulcrum of her generation: our voice at home, and your conscience abroad."  

গ উত্তর: সারমর্ম: অন্নীত ব্যক্তি তার প্রজন্মের গুরুত্বপূর্ণ নৈতিক ও রাজনৈতিক প্রতিনিধিত্ব করে; ঘরে (দেশে) তিনি মানুষের কন্ঠস্বর, বিদেশে তিনি অন্যদের নৈতিক দিক মনে করিয়ে দেওয়ার প্রতীক।  

ঘ উত্তর: 'fulcrum of her generation'—এর বাংলা অর্থ হলো 'তার প্রজন্মের সোপান/কেন্দ্রীয় চালক' বা 'কেন্দ্রবিন্দু'। ফুলোক্রাম হলো লিভার-সিস্টেমে ভারসাম্য রক্ষা করার বিন্দু; এখানে বোঝানো হচ্ছে যে সে প্রজন্মের আলোচ্য বিষয়গুলোর ভারসাম্য ও নির্দেশনায় তার ভূমিকা কেন্দ্রীয় এবং স্থিতিশীলতা প্রদানকারী।

Explanation:
ক: ইংরেজি ব্যাকরণ অনুযায়ী বাক্যের শুরুতে ক্যাপিটাল লেটার, উদ্ধৃতির আগে কৌমার্য (comma) এবং উদ্ধৃতির বন্ধনী উল্লিখিত করে সঠিক বিন্যাস লাগবে।  

খ: উদ্ধৃতিতে ডবল কাঠামো ভাঙা আছে—প্রধান অভিব্যক্তি এবং দেশ/বিদেশ-দুটি অংশ আলাদা কমা বা ডবলবিন্দু দিয়ে স্পষ্ট হওয়া দরকার।  

গ: সারমর্মে, মন্তব্যটি বলছে যে সেই ব্যক্তি নিজের সময়ের রাজনৈতিক ও নৈতিক কেন্দ্রবিন্দু; তার অনুপস্থিতি সেই প্রজন্মে শূণ্যতা সৃষ্টি করবে।  

ঘ: রূপকটি কার্যকর কারণ এটি একটি যান্ত্রিক ধারণা (fulcrum) ব্যবহার করে সামাজিক ও নৈতিক প্রভাবকে বোঝায়—কীভাবে একজন ব্যক্তিই ভারসাম্য ও নির্দেশনা ধরেন।

After leaving public life in 2008 he told journalists 'please, do not ring us'. Novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie reflected, 'You are in the nexus of history, ours at home and yours overseas'.

Options:
ক. প্রথম বাক্যের ভুল সর্বনাম ও বহুবচন সংশোধন কর।
খ. উদ্ধৃতিতে অনুচ্ছেদ বিন্যাস ও মন্তব্যের ধারার জন্য প্রয়োজনীয় চিহ্ন যোগ কর।

ঘ. ‘nexus of history’ কথাটির অন্তর্নিহিত অর্থ ব্যাখ্যা করুন এবং কেন লেখক এটি ব্যবহার করেছেন বলে মনে হয়?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: 'us' বহুবচন ব্যবহার ভুল; যদি কানে থাকা জন ব্যক্তিই একা উপদেশ দিয়েছেন তবে 'me' বা 'him' সঠিক হবে। এখানে প্রেক্ষাপটে একজন পুরুষ বলেছে—তাই: "please, do not ring me."  

খ উত্তর: উদ্ধৃতিটি ধারাবাহিকতা ও কামের জন্য সংশোধিত: "You are in the nexus of history: ours at home, and yours overseas."  

গ উত্তর: সঠিক ও প্রাঞ্জল অনুচ্ছেদ: "After leaving public life in 2008, he told journalists, 'Please do not ring me.' Novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie reflected, 'You are in the nexus of history: ours at home, and yours overseas.'"  

ঘ উত্তর: 'nexus of history' অর্থাৎ ইতিহাসের সংযোগ-বিন্দু বা মিলনস্থল—তার কাজ বা ব্যক্তিত্ব এমনভাবে সময়ের প্রধান ঘটনা ও ধারার সঙ্গে জড়িত যে তিনি ঐ মুহূর্তের কেন্দ্রবিন্দু হিসেবে সমকক্ষ সম্পর্ক তৈরি করেন। লেখক এই শব্দ ব্যবহার করেছেন সম্ভবত ব্যক্তিটির গুরুত্ব ও ঐক্যবদ্ধ প্রভাব বুঝাতে—যেখানে স্থানীয় ও বৈশ্বিক ইতিহাস পরস্পরের সাথে মিলিত হয়।

Explanation:
ক: পার্সোনাল প্রোনাউন নিয়ম অনুযায়ী 'us' ব্যবহার শুধুমাত্র যখন একাধিক ব্যক্তিকে বুঝাতে হয়; এখানে এক ব্যক্তির রেফারেন্স থাকলে 'me' বা নির্দিষ্ট পুরুষ হলে 'him' প্রযোজ্য।  

খ: উদ্ধৃতির ভিতরে দুটি অংশ (নেক্সাস ব্যাখ্যা ও দেশ-বিদেশ) আলাদা করার জন্য ডবলবিন্দু ও কমা দরকার।  

গ: সম্পূর্ণ অনুচ্ছেদটি উদ্ধৃতি ও বর্ণনাকে সঠিকভাবে সংযুক্ত করে পাঠযোগ্য করে।  

ঘ: 'nexus' শব্দটি জটিল সম্পর্ক ও সংযোগের ধারণা দেয়; এটি ব্যবহার করে লেখক ব্যক্তি ও সময়ের মধ্যে ঘনিষ্ঠ সম্পর্ক ও ঐতিহাসিক গুরুত্বকে নির্দেশ করছেন।

ক উত্তর: তিনি টাকা গ্রহণ করেছেন কারণ তিনি ছেঁড়ামোড়ার ছাদ মেরামত করার জন্য আর্থিক সহায়তার প্রয়োজন অনুভব করছিলেন এবং দানকারী সরাসরি বলা ছিল যে তা ছাদ মেরামতের জন্য—তাই তিনি সহায়তা হিসেবে গ্রহণ করে নিলেন।খ উত্তর: তিনি নোটগুলিকে একটি ছোট কুটিরের মাটির মাটির পাত্র (clay pot) এর ভিতরে রেখে সেটির ওপর ভাত ঢেকে রাখলেন, অর্থাৎ পাত্রের ভেতরে রেখে তা Rice দিয়ে ঢেকে সাঁকো দেওয়া হয়েছে।গ উত্তর:Reported speech: The passerby told her to take that five hundred taka and to repair her leaking roof. বা বাংলায়: পথচারী তাকে বললেন যে তিনি ঐ পাঁচশো টাকা নিয়ে তাঁর ছাঁদ মেরামত করুন।ঘ উত্তর: সম্পূর্ণ সুরক্ষার নিশ্চয়তা নেই; তবে কিছু পদক্ষেপ গ্রহণে সুরক্ষা বাড়ে — টাকাটি একটি শক্ত পাত্রে রাখার মাধ্যমে সরাসরি চোর-দেখার সম্ভাবনা কমে, পাত্রটি ঢেকে রাখলে অচেনা চোখে দেখা কঠিন হয়, এবং সবচেয়ে ভালো হলো নির্ভরযোগ্য পরিচিত কোনো স্থানে (নিরাপদ লকার/বন্ধু-পরিচিতর কাছে) রাখা বা তৎক্ষণাৎ ব্যাবহার করে মেরামত করা।

Explanation:
ক: ব্যক্তি যখন কোনো নির্দিষ্ট উদ্দেশ্যে (ছাদ মেরামত) আর্থিক সহায়তা পান এবং প্রয়োজন থাকে, তখন সহানুভূতিতে টাকা গ্রহণ করা যুক্তিযুক্ত। খ: গ্রাহকের বর্ণনা অনুযায়ী তিনি মুদ্রাগুলোকে মাটির পাত্রে রেখে Rice দিয়ে ঢাকা দিয়ে রাখেছেন—এটি সাধারণ গ্রামীণ নিরাপত্তার উপায়। গ: reported speech-এ সরাসরি উদ্ধৃতিটি সাধারণত past tense ও backshifting হয়: 'said/told' + that/to-infinitive ইত্যাদি। এখানে নির্দেশমূলক বাক্য হওয়ায় to-infinitive ব্যবহার করা সুবিধাজনক। ঘ: পাত্রে রাখা কিছুটা নিরাপত্তা দেয় কিন্তু এটি নিশ্চিতভাবে নিরাপদ নয় (যদিও অচেনা চোখে সহজে ধরা পড়ে না)। সর্বোত্তম ধারনা: দ্রুত দরকারের কাজে ব্যয় করা বা কোনও নিরাপদ, পরিচিত স্থানে রাখার ব্যবস্থা করা।

Question:
A kind school teacher noticed a poor student struggling to buy books. The teacher slipped a sealed envelope containing two hundred taka into the student's hand and whispered, "Use this for your books, but don't tell anyone." The student, shy and afraid of losing it on the way home, carefully sewed the envelope into the inner lining of his school shirt.

Options:
ক. শিক্ষক ছাত্রকে কত টাকা দিল এবং কীভাবে দিল?
খ. ছাত্র টাকা কোথায় লুকিয়ে রাখলো?
গ. "Use this for your books, but don't tell anyone." — এই বাক্যটি reported speech-এ লিখ।
ঘ. শাড়ি/ইনর্লাইনিং-এ টাকা সেলাই করে রাখার সুবিধা ও অসুবিধা দুটো করে উল্লেখ কর।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: শিক্ষক ছাত্রকে একটি সিল করা খাম হিসেবে দুইশত টাকা দিয়েছেন এবং তা গোপনে হাতের মধ্যে দিয়ে দেন (চুপকে দিলেন)।খ উত্তর: ছাত্র খামটি তার স্কুল শার্টের ভেতরের লাইনের মধ্যে সেলাই করে রেখেছে, অর্থাৎ পোশাকের ভিতরে লুকিয়ে রাখল।গ উত্তর:Reported speech: The teacher told the student to use that money for his books and not to tell anyone. বা বাংলায়: শিক্ষক ছাত্রকে বললেন যে ঐ টাকা তার বইয়ের জন্য ব্যবহার কর এবং কাউকে বলবে না।ঘ উত্তর: সুবিধা: (1) পোশাকের ভেতরে থাকা হলে সোজা-সোজি চুরি হওয়ার সম্ভাবনা কমে, (2) ছাত্র নিজেই সবসময় সাথে রাখায় হারানোর সুযোগ কমে। অসুবিধা: (1) যদি পোশাক ধোয়া বা মেরামত করার সময় খাম বের হয়ে যায়, টাকা হারিয়ে যেতে পারে, (2) যদি কাউকে সন্দেহ হয়ে খুঁজ করলে আক্রমণ বা লুকিয়ে থাকা খারাপ ফল ডেকে আনতে পারে; এছাড়া টাকার জরুরি প্রয়োজন হলে দ্রুত ব্যবহার করা কঠিন।

Explanation:
ক ও খ: বর্ণনার সরাসরি বিশ্লেষণ। গ: নির্দেশমূলক বাক্য reported speech-এ সাধারণত 'told/asked' + to-infinitive অথবা 'said (that)' কাঠামোতে রূপান্তরিত হয়; এখানে 'to use' ও 'not to tell' ব্যবহার করা যুক্তিসঙ্গত। ঘ: পোশাকের ভিতরে লুকানো বহু ক্ষেত্রে নিরাপত্তা বাড়ায়, কিন্তু তা সম্পূর্ণ সুরক্ষা দেয় না; দৈনন্দিন কাজ, ধোয়া বা দেখাশোনা সংক্রান্ত ঝুঁকি ও সামাজিক প্রভাব বিবেচনা করা উচিত।

Question:
A small market vendor found a sealed sack outside his stall in the morning. A short note attached read, "For any needy customer today." Inside the sack were one thousand taka in mixed notes. He was puzzled where to keep it so that it would be available when a needy customer arrived; finally he placed the sack in the store-room under a stack of grain bags.

Options:
ক. নোটটিতে কী লেখা ছিল এবং তা কাদের উদ্দেশ্যে ছিল?
খ. বণিক টাকাটি কোথায় রেখে দিল?
গ. এই ঘটনার নৈতিক দিক কী — সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে ব্যাখ্যা কর।
ঘ. নামবিহীন দান রাখতে বা গ্রহণে কী ঝুঁকি থাকতে পারে? দুটি উল্লেখ কর।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: নোটটিতে লেখা ছিল "For any needy customer today," অর্থাৎ আজকের দিন কোনও দরিদ্র গ্রাহকের জন্য এই টাকা রাখা হয়েছে। এটি দরিদ্র বা সাহায্যের প্রয়োজন এমন গ্রাহককে দেওয়ার উদ্দেশ্যে রাখা হয়েছিল।খ উত্তর: বণিক টাকাটিকে তার গুদাম/স্টোররুমে রাখল এবং সেখানে শস্যের ব্যাগের নিচে রাখার মাধ্যমে লুকিয়ে রাখল—অর্থাৎ স্টোররুমের ব্যাগগুলোর নিচে রাখা হয়েছে।গ উত্তর: নৈতিক দিক: এটি দান-সহমর্মিতার একটি সুন্দর উদাহরণ—অচেনা কেউ অন্যের কল্যাণের জন্য সম্পদ ছেড়ে গেছে এবং বণিক সেটি প্রয়োজনে দেওয়ার ইচ্ছা প্রকাশ করল; ইতিবাচক দিক হলো সমাজে সদাচরণ ও সহায়তার প্রচলন। একই সঙ্গে দায়বদ্ধতা ও সততার প্রয়োজন—বণিককে নেয়া দান সঠিক উদ্দেশ্যে ব্যয় করতে হবে।ঘ উত্তর: ঝুঁকি: (1) অননুমোদিত ব্যবহার — বণিক নিজে বা অন‌্য কেউ টাকাটি নিজেদের জন্য ব্যবহার করে নিতে পারে, ফলে আসল দরিদ্র ব্যক্তি বঞ্চিত হবে; (2) নিরাপত্তাগত ঝুঁকি — অপরিচিত টাকা রেখে দিলে চুরি, ভুল বোঝাবুঝি বা আইনগত প্রশ্ন উঠতে পারে (যদি নোটে স্পষ্ট নির্দেশ না থাকে বা পরে কেউ দাবি করে)।

Explanation:
ক ও খ: সরাসরি বর্ণনা থেকে উত্তরের পুনরাবৃত্তি। গ: নৈতিকতা বিশ্লেষণে দান ও দায়িত্ব—ভালো উদ্দেশ্য থাকলে সেটি সঠিকভাবে পরিচালনা করার নৈতিক কর্তব্যও বিদ্যমান। ঘ: অজ্ঞাত উৎসের অর্থ গ্রহণের সময় নিরাপত্তা ও স্বচ্ছতা নিয়ে চিন্তা করা প্রয়োজন; শ্রদ্ধাশীল কিন্তু সতর্ক হওয়া উত্তম।

Question:
Despite measurable social progress, many economies still restrict women's full participation in paid work and decision-making. Removing legal, cultural, and logistical barriers is widely seen as essential for sustainable development and shared prosperity.

Options:
ক. প্রদত্ত বাক্যটি ব্যাকরণগতভাবে সঠিকভাবে পুনর্লিখুন: 'Women are important than men in economy and they needs job to growth.'
খ. নিম্নলিখিত বাক্যে সঠিক সর্বনামটি নির্বাচন করুন (plural সঙ্গত): 'Each woman should be given ___ education so that ___ can contribute equally.' (বেছে নিন: her / they / them / you)
গ. তিনটি সংক্ষিপ্ত এবং বাস্তব উদ্যোগ লিখুন যা সরকার গ্রহণ করলে নারীদের কর্মসংস্থানে অংশগ্রহণ বৃদ্ধি পাবে।
ঘ. একটি এক-লাইনের সারাংশ দিন: (বিষয় — অর্থনীতিতে নারীদের ভূমিকা কেন গুরুত্বপূর্ণ)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Corrected sentence: "Women are as important as men in the economy, and they need jobs to grow." 

খ Chosen pronouns: "they" (Each woman should be given they education so that they can contribute equally.) — note: better construction is "Every woman should be given an education so that she or they can contribute equally." For gender-neutral plural usage in general statements, use "they". 

গ Three initiatives: 
1) Provide subsidized childcare and safe transport to workplaces to remove practical barriers for working women. 
2) Enforce equal-pay and anti-discrimination laws plus incentives for firms that hire and promote women. 
3) Implement skills-training and return-to-work programs targeting women who left the workforce (e.g., after childbirth) including digital and vocational training. 

ঘ One-line summary: "Expanding women's participation in paid work and decision-making is essential for inclusive economic growth and national development."

Explanation:
ক — The original sentence had comparative misuse ("important than" should be "as important as"), subject-verb agreement errors ("they needs" → "they need"), and awkward phrase "to growth" (correct: "to grow" or better: "for growth" or "to achieve economic growth"). I corrected these to produce a clear, grammatical sentence. 

খ — The exercise asks for a plural/gender-neutral pronoun. Modern usage accepts singular 'they' for gender-neutral reference; however, in formal grammar "Every woman should be given an education so that she can contribute equally" is also correct. If plural agreement is required, rephrase to "All women should be given education so that they can contribute equally." 

গ — The three suggested initiatives address (1) practical barriers (childcare, transport), (2) legal/economic incentives (equal-pay, anti-discrimination, hiring incentives), and (3) capacity building (training and re-entry support). These are evidence-based approaches used in many policy packages to increase women's workforce participation. 

ঘ — The summary distills the context into one sentence emphasizing the link between women's inclusion and broad economic benefits.

Question:
In many rural and peri-urban communities, girls face obstacles to schooling: long distances to schools, safety concerns, poverty, and expectations of early marriage. Community-level action plus targeted public policies are needed to ensure girls complete basic education.

Options:
ক. নীচের বাক্যের ভুলগুলো শনাক্ত করুন এবং সম্পাদনা করে সঠিক বাক্য লিখুন: 'Many rural girls doesn't go to schools because their families fearing for their safety.'
খ. দুইটি পরিমাপযোগ্য সূচক (measurable indicators) দিন যেগুলো ব্যবহার করে একটি জেলা সরকার মেয়েদের শিক্ষার অগ্রগতি মূল্যায়ন করতে পারে।
গ. কমিউনিটি নেতৃবৃন্দের কাছে একটি কার্যকর নীতি সুপারিশ লিখুন যাতে তাড়াতাড়ি বিবাহ কমে। (সংক্ষেপে মন্তব্য করুন)।
ঘ. নিম্নোক্ত কথাটি একটি রিপোর্ট-স্তরের আনুষ্ঠানিক বাক্যে পুনর্লিখুন: 'If girls learn, whole family will be benefit.'


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Corrected sentence: "Many rural girls do not go to school because their families fear for their safety." 

খ Two measurable indicators: 
1) Girls' net enrollment rate in primary and secondary schools (%) by age cohort. 
2) Girls' completion rate for primary and lower-secondary education (%) or the percentage of girls who reach grade 5/grade 8. 

গ Policy recommendation: Implement and enforce a community-led birth and marriage registration campaign combined with conditional cash transfers for families that delay daughters' marriages until at least age 18 and keep girls enrolled in school. 

ঘ Formal sentence: "Educating girls generates measurable benefits for their families and communities."

Explanation:
ক — Errors corrected: subject-verb agreement ("girls doesn't" → "girls do not"), plural vs. singular noun usage ("schools" vs. "school"; "go to school" is idiomatic), and verb/noun form ("fearing" → "fear"). The cleaned sentence is grammatically correct and idiomatic. 

খ — Indicators chosen are standard, quantifiable metrics used by education planners and international agencies (UNICEF, UNESCO) to track access and retention: enrollment and completion rates. These are easy to measure through school records or household surveys. 

গ — The recommendation combines registration (which helps legal enforcement), conditional incentives (which have been shown in evaluations to increase school attendance and delay marriage), and community ownership (essential for cultural change). It is practical, measurable, and politically feasible at local level. 

ঘ — The rewrite turns a colloquial conditional into a formal declarative sentence suitable for reports, focusing on measurable benefits and shifting to third-person nominal phrasing.

Question:
Leadership in politics and business still shows gender imbalances. Many organizations consider mentorship programs, flexible workplaces, and transparent promotion criteria to improve gender parity at senior levels.

Options:
ক. গ্রামাটিক্যালি ভুলগুলো চিহ্নিত করুন এবং সংশোধনসহ পুনর্লিখুন: 'Only few women are in top positions, they lacks support and mentor.'
খ. সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে তিনটি সুবিধা লিখুন যেগুলো একটি সংস্থাকে হবে যদি তার নেতৃত্বে আরও বেশি নারী থাকেন।
গ. একটি পরিমাপযোগ্য লক্ষ্য প্রস্তাব করুন যা একটি কোম্পানি পাঁচ বছরের মধ্যে পরিচালনায় লিঙ্গ-সংগততা অর্জনের উদ্দেশ্যে ব্যবহার করতে পারে। (কী পরিমাপ করবেন এবং কোন শতাংশ লক্ষ্য করবেন?)
ঘ. বোর্ডগুলোকে লিঙ্গ-সমতা গ্রহণে উৎসাহিত করতে একটি প্ররোচিত এক-লাইন আবেদন লেখুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Corrected sentence: "Only a few women are in top positions; they lack support and mentors." 

খ Three benefits of more women in leadership: 
1) Better decision-making through diverse perspectives, reducing groupthink. 
2) Improved organizational performance and profitability (evidence links gender diversity with stronger financial outcomes). 
3) Stronger talent pipelines and role models that increase retention of high-potential employees. 

গ Measurable five-year target: Increase the share of women in senior management from current level to at least 40% within five years, measured as the percentage of executive and director-level roles held by women (reported annually). 

ঘ Call-to-action sentence: "Adopt clear gender-targets, transparent promotion criteria, and mentorship programs now to unlock the full leadership potential of our organization."

Explanation:
ক — Fixes: include the article "a" with "few" ("a few" vs. "few" changes meaning), subject-verb agreement ("they lacks" → "they lack"), and plural consistency for "mentor" → "mentors"; punctuation updated to join related clauses correctly. 

খ — The three benefits reflect commonly cited organizational advantages from research: cognitive diversity, financial outcomes, and talent management. These are concise and directly relevant to organizational leaders. 

গ — A specific numeric target (e.g., 40%) is realistic and measurable; companies often set targets in the 30–50% range depending on baseline. The indicator is percent of leadership positions held by women, which is straightforward to track through HR data and annual reporting. 

ঘ — The one-line appeal combines policy actions (targets, transparency, mentorship) into a succinct, persuasive message aimed at boards and executive teams, emphasizing urgency and practical steps.

Question:
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not a disease but a development issue. It usually effects childrens ability to concentrate. Sometimes teachers wrongly thinks that these are lazy students. Families needs guidance, proper therapy and patience to help them grow.

Options:

ঘ. শেষ বাক্যটিকে শুদ্ধ ও প্রাঞ্জল ইংরেজিতে পরিমার্জন করে দিন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not a disease but a developmental issue.

খ It usually affects children's ability to concentrate.

গ Sometimes teachers mistakenly think that these students are lazy.

ঘ Families need guidance, appropriate therapy, and patience to support children with ADHD as they grow and learn.

Explanation:
ক: Use the conventional hyphenation and abbreviation 'Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)'. 'development issue' is awkward; 'developmental issue' is the correct adjective form.

খ: 'effects' is the noun form; the correct verb is 'affects'. 'childrens' is incorrect plural; use 'children's' (possessive) to indicate 'the ability of children'. Also include the apostrophe. 

গ: 'wrongly thinks' is incorrect because 'teachers' is plural; use 'think'. 'these are lazy students' is wordy and awkward — 'mistakenly think that these students are lazy' is clearer and maintains subject-verb agreement.

ঘ: 'Families needs' is wrong; 'families' is plural so the verb should be 'need'. 'Proper therapy and patience' is fine but 'appropriate therapy' sounds more formal. The rewritten sentence is concise and supportive, emphasizing help rather than blame.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Down syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes intellectual disability.

খ It is present at birth and is characterized by certain facial features.

গ Many parents suffer a great deal and do not know how to care for these children.

ঘ Down syndrome is a genetic condition that causes intellectual disability. It is present from birth and is characterized by distinctive facial features. Many parents face great hardship and are unsure how to provide the best care for their children. Unfortunately, society sometimes shuns families affected by the condition, making daily life even more difficult.

Explanation:
ক: The possessive form 'Down's syndrome' is outdated; standard usage is 'Down syndrome' without the apostrophe. 'intelectual' is misspelled; correct is 'intellectual'. Also change 'which' to 'that' for restrictive clause clarity.

খ: 'often appeared at birth' is ungrammatical; 'is present at birth' or 'is apparent at birth' are correct. 'characterised' is British spelling; both British and American are acceptable, but ensure consistency. I used 'is characterized' for grammatical completeness and added 'is' for passive voice clarity.

গ: 'childs' is incorrect; plural is 'children'. 'suffer a lot' is informal; 'suffer a great deal' is more formal and natural. 'handle' is acceptable but 'care for' is clearer in this medical/social context.

ঘ: The rewrite corrects terminology, spelling, and grammar; it improves tone and flow and avoids stigmatizing language, focusing on support and societal attitudes.

ঘ. সম্পূর্ণ অনুচ্ছেদটি সাবলীল ও শুদ্ধ ইংরেজিতে পুনঃরচনা করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Cerebral palsy is a neurological condition that affects movement and posture. Many children are diagnosed with this disorder at an early age.

খ The symptoms vary from mild to severe.

গ The parents often feel helpless; their suffering is immense.

ঘ Cerebral palsy is a neurological condition that affects movement and posture. Many children are diagnosed with this disorder at an early age. The symptoms vary from mild to severe. The parents often feel helpless, and their suffering is immense. Although children with cerebral palsy may differ from their peers in physical abilities, they should receive love, support, and appropriate education.

Explanation:
ক: 'effects' is incorrect here because the verb should be 'affects' (to influence). 'childrens' is wrong plural form; the correct plural is 'children'. Add the article 'an' before 'early age' to make 'at an early age.'

খ: 'symptoms' is plural so the verb must be 'vary' (not 'varies'). 'servere' is a misspelling; correct form is 'severe'.

গ: 'parents often feels' is wrong because 'parents' is plural; use 'feel'. The original had two clauses separated by a comma causing a comma splice. Use a semicolon or join with 'and'. 'Their struggles are huge' is grammatically acceptable but stylistically 'their suffering is immense' is clearer and more natural.

ঘ: The full rewrite fixes subject-verb agreement, plural forms, spelling errors, and awkward phrasing. It also improves flow by connecting ideas and using natural collocations ('affects movement', 'at an early age', 'appropriate education').
