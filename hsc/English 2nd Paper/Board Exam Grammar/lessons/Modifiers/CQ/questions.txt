Question:
Newspaper plays a very (a) — (pre-modify the noun) role in modern civilization. It publishes news and views of home and abroad. Only (b) — (pre-modify the noun) knowledge is not enough in this competitive world. A newspaper helps a man (c) — (post-modify the verb with infinitive) his general knowledge. Besides academic books one should read newspapers (d) — (post modify the verb). Newspaper helps one (e) — (post-modify the verb with an infinitive) the facts the world. (f) — (pre-modify the verb with a participle phrase) regularly. One can be aware of everything. There are (g) — (pre-modify the noun) kinds of newspapers. One should select newspaper (h) — (post-modify the verb). One should choose the (i) — (pre-modify the noun) newspaper because many newspapers present news partially. Whatever the paper is, it (j) — (pre-modify the verb) helps a man.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) significant/ Important (b) bookish (c) to increase/ to enrich (d) everyday/ regularly (e) to know (f) Reading newspaper (g) different/ various (h) properly/ rightly/ justly/ wisely/ prudently (i) Impartial (j) always/ really/ actually/ truly

Explanation:
Pre-modifiers for nouns are adjectives or participle phrases placed before the noun, so blanks like (a), (b), (g) and (i) require adjective-type words (e.g., "important", "general", "various", "reliable"). Verbs are often followed by infinitives to show purpose or result, so post-modifying a verb in (c) and (e) needs "to + verb" ("to improve", "to know"), while manner/frequency after a verb (d) takes an adverb like "regularly." A participle phrase or an -ing form (e.g., "reading regularly" or "by reading regularly") shows how an action is done for (f), and general statements like (j) take an adverb (e.g., "always") to modify the verb.

Explanation:
ক "ideal" — এখানে student-এর আগে একটি বিশেষণ চাই যা তাকে বর্ণনা করে, তাই 'ideal' উপযুক্ত।  
খ "many" — qualities-এর পরিমাণ দেখাতে একটি quantifier প্রয়োজন, তাই 'many' ব্যবহার করা হয়।  
গ "regularly" — ক্রিয়াকে কিভাবে করা হচ্ছে তা দেখাতে ক্রিয়ার পরে একটি ক্রিয়াবিশেষণ লাগে, যেমন 'studies regularly'।  
ঘ "main" — duty শব্দের প্রধানতা বোঝাতে পূর্বে বিশেষণ 'main' প্রয়োগ করা হয়।  
ঙ "his" — দায়িত্বটি ছাত্রের বোঝাতে possessive 'his' ব্যবহার করা হয়।  
চ "every" — moment শব্দকে প্রতিটি মুহূর্ত হিসেবে দেখাতে determiner 'every' দরকার।  
ছ "a student" — নামের পরে appositive হিসেবে পরিচয় দিলে বাক্য পরিষ্কার হয়: 'Sabuj, a student of our class,...'।  
জ "very" — helpful বিশেষণটির মাত্রা বাড়াতে তার আগে 'very' দেওয়া হয়।  
ঝ "to be" — 'try' ক্রিয়ার সঙ্গে infinitive ব্যবহৃত হয় ('try to ...'), তাই 'to be' সঠিক।

Language plays a (a) - (pre-modify the adjective with an intensifier) important role in our life. We use language from the time we wake up (b) - (post-modify the verb) till we go to bed at night. We use language not only in our (c) ---(pre-modify the noun) hours, but also in our dreams. We use language (d) - (post-modify the verb with an infinitive) what we feel and to say what we like or dislike. We also use language (e) - (post modify the verb with an infinitive) information.

But we had to struggle (i) - (use adverb to post-modify the verb) to establish the right to our language. Many (j) - (pre-modify the noun with an adjective) sons of our country sacrificed their lives for our mother-tongue.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Ans to the Q. no. 6[math]\\[/math](a) very; (b) in the morning; (c) waking/active; (d) to express; (e) to share/to transfer/to record/to exchange; (1) ever/constantly/always: (g) inseparable/essential/important; (h) independent; (i) hard/earnestly/persistently; (j) valiant/ brave/heroic.

Explanation:
Language in the blanks is chosen by function: an intensifier (e.g. "very" or "extremely") goes before an adjective, so (a) is "very important" to strengthen the adjective. Verbs are post‑modified by adverbs or infinitives to show manner or purpose, so for (b) an adverb like "constantly/continually" fits, for (d) and (e) infinitives like "to express" and "to convey" show purpose, and for (i) an adverb like "hard" or "valiantly" shows how they struggled. Nouns are pre‑modified by adjectives, so (c) "waking hours", (g) "an essential part", (h) "an independent nation" and (j) "many brave/patriotic sons" correctly place descriptive words before the nouns.

খ ও জ-এ verb-এর পরে modifier লাগে: খ-এ adverbial phrase/phrase যেমন "wrote extensively" verb-কে পরিমার্জন করে, আর জ-এ infinitive phrase যেমন "to inspire" কাজের উদ্দেশ্য ব্যাখ্যা করে।  
গ-এ appositive ব্যবহার করে noun-এর পরে সরাসরি ব্যাখ্যা বা উপাধি দেয়া হয় (উদাহরণ: "Nazrul, the rebel poet, ..."), আর ঘ-এ possession দিয়ে মালিকানা বা সম্পর্ক দেখাতে হয় (উদাহরণ: "poetic flair's death")।

Explanation:
a "poisonous" (or "toxic") is correct because it is an adjective that directly pre-modifies the noun "substance".  
b "very" is an intensifier (adverb) used before the adjective "dangerous" to strengthen it.  
c "this" is a demonstrative that points to the particular substance just mentioned.  
d "many" is a quantifier placed before "villages" to indicate number.  
e "our" is a possessive determiner that modifies "country" to show ownership.  
f a noun used as an adjective (e.g., "village" in "village people") modifies "people" to specify which people.  
g an adverb like "commonly" or "widely" pre-modifies the verb "found" to show frequency/extent.  
h an infinitive phrase such as "to prevent it" is used after "take measures" to state the purpose.

Solution:
(a) to survive/ to live (b) all/ every (c) our (d) Food (e) so (f) Some (g) harmful (h) our (i) Taking/ Eating (j) ensuring

Explanation:
Use an infinitive of purpose after the verb to show why we take food — for example (a) "to live." Use a quantifier to modify the noun phrase (b) "all living beings," and a possessive to show ownership for (c) "our food"; a noun used as an adjective (d) "food" before "adulteration" makes the meaning clear. Use an intensifier like (e) "so" before the adverb ("so alarmingly that..."), a determiner such as (f) "many" or "some" before "dishonest businessmen," and an adjective to pre-modify (g) "harmful chemicals"; use a possessive (h) "our" for "health."

Explanation:
(a) takes an adjective — use "most important" because it qualifies the noun "elements"; (f) needs a quantifier like "many" or "various" before "kinds"; (h) needs an adjective such as "chemical" to describe fertilizers; (i) uses a past participle "polluted" to describe the noun "water".

Solution:
(a) store-house (b) coming (c) Several/ Some (d) reading (e) systematically (f) of the readers/ students (g) dictionaries, encyclopedias (h) of academic categories (i) card (j) mainly/ generally

Explanation:
a) Use a noun complement (e.g., "storehouse") because after "is a" we need a noun that names what a library is.  
b) Use a participle (e.g., "attending") because a participle clause (attending all classes) compresses the relative clause "who attend" and describes the students.  
c) Put an adjective or numeral before "almirahs" (e.g., "several almirahs") to pre-modify the noun and show quantity or quality.  
d) Use a participle as an adjective (e.g., "reading room") because the participle "reading" describes the purpose of the room.  
e) Use an adverb or adverbial phrase after the verb (e.g., "arranged alphabetically") to tell how the books are arranged.  
f) Use a prepositional phrase (e.g., "of the students" or "to students") to show whose needs and interests are served.  
g) Use nouns (e.g., "dictionaries, encyclopaedias") as examples of reference books; a simple noun list names them.  
h) Use a prepositional phrase (e.g., "on various subjects") to indicate the subject matter of the books.  
i) Use a noun (e.g., "library card") because each student possesses that object; the noun names the item.  
j) Use an adverbial/time phrase (e.g., "in the afternoon") after "crowded" to indicate when the reading room is crowded.

Explanation:
The blanks require modifiers placed according to their grammatical role: a post‑modifying adjective phrase follows the noun, pre‑modifiers (adjectives or adverbs) come before nouns or participles/verbs, possessives and determiners appear before nouns, and adverbial phrases can follow verbs. For example, (a) "riddled with potholes" is an adjective phrase that post‑modifies "roads"; (b) "reckless" pre‑modifies "driving"; (c) "adequately" is an adverb pre‑modifying the participle "trained"; (d) "barely" pre‑modifies the verb phrase "put their signature"; (e) "human" is a noun used as an adjective before "life"; (i) "more" is the comparative determiner in "more valuable than me"; (g) and (j) use post‑modifying adverbial phrases like "at high speed" / "at breakneck speed" after the verb; (h) "not" pre‑modifies "drive" to make it negative; and (i) (possessive) "their" correctly shows ownership in "their own lives."

Explanation:
Each blank needs a specific word class: use adjectives/determiners to pre-modify nouns, adverbs to modify adjectives, quantifiers for plural nouns, noun‑adjuncts (a noun used as adjective) for programs/channels, participial or prepositional phrases to post‑modify nouns, and an article before the singular countable noun "addiction." Example fills: (a) "major", (b) "modern", (c) "general", (d) "many", (e) "educational" or "news", (f) "highly", (g) "in many ways" (post‑modifier), (h) "offered by the Open University", (i) "science" or "specialist" (channels), (j) "an addiction." These choices follow basic grammar: adjectives before nouns, adverbs before adjectives, quantifiers/countability rules, noun adjuncts for classification, post‑modifier phrases for extra information, and "an" for a singular noun beginning with a vowel sound.

Nazrul, (c) — (use an appositive), won the attention of everyone in his early childhood. He wrote ceaselessly until the death of (d) — (use possessive pronoun) poetic flair. He composed his songs (e) — (use an infinitive phrase to post-modify the verb). His songs are (f) — (use an intensifier to premodify the adjective) melodious. He enriched the Bengali literature (g) — (use an adverb to postmodify the verb). His literary works have enriched (h) — (use a noun adjective) literature. He was (i) — (use an article) secular poet. He sang the songs of equality (j) — (use an adverbial phrase).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) great/ famous/ renowned/ rebel (b) almost/ extensively/ profusely (c) our national poet/ a rebel poet/ a small boy (d) his (e) to inspire people (f) very/ highly (g) greatly/ vastly (h) Bengali/ Bangla (i) a (j) throughout his life/ in a loud voice

Explanation:
a Use an adjective before the noun (e.g., "a renowned poet") because a pre-modifier (adjective) directly describes the noun "poet."  
b Use an adverb after the verb (e.g., "wrote prolifically") because post-modifying the verb requires an adverb that shows how he wrote.  
c Use an appositive (e.g., "Nazrul, a revolutionary poet,") because an appositive renames or explains the noun and is set off by commas.  
d Use a possessive pronoun (e.g., "his poetic flair") because the possessive shows that the flair belongs to him.  
e Use an infinitive phrase after the verb (e.g., "composed his songs to inspire people") because an infinitive phrase explains purpose and post-modifies the verb.  
f Use an intensifier before the adjective (e.g., "very melodious") because an intensifier (like very, extremely) strengthens the adjective.  
g Use an adverb after the verb (e.g., "enriched Bengali literature greatly") because a post-modifying adverb shows the degree or manner of enriching.  
h Use a noun used as an adjective (noun-adjective) (e.g., "world literature") because a noun can modify another noun to specify the type of literature.  
i Use an article before the noun phrase (e.g., "a secular poet") because articles ("a," "an," "the") are required before singular countable nouns.  
j Use an adverbial phrase (e.g., "for all people") because an adverbial phrase modifies the verb "sang" by indicating purpose, audience, or manner.

Question:
Deforestation means cutting down of trees (a) — (post-modify the verb). To meet up the basic needs of food and housing, trees are being cut in large scale and thus it causes (b) — (pre modify the noun) imbalance. Besides, there are some dishonest people who cut trees in our forest (c) — (use an infinitive phrase to post-modify the verb). The (d) — (use a noun adjective to pre modify the noun) level is rising and many parts of the world are going to be engulfed by the sea in near future. New areas of the world are (e) — (use a participle to pre-modify the verb) turned into desert as a result of deforestation. So, we must stop (f) — (use a participle to post-modify the verb) down trees unnecessarily. (g) — (use a participle to pre-modify the noun) trees indiscriminately will be hazardous for our future existence. If we destroy trees (h) — (use an adverbial phrase to post-modify the verb) one day the country will turn into a great desert. The (i) — (use a participle to pre-modify the noun) temperature will cause greenhouse effect. Necessary measures should be taken (j) — (use an infinitive phrase to post-modify the verb).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) indiscriminately (b) ecological/ environmental (c) to fulfil their own interest/ to earn their livelihood/ to earn money (d) sea/ water (e) being (f) cutting (g) Cutting/ chopping (h) in an indiscriminate manner/ in an inconsiderate way/ without any consideration (i) rising (j) to stop deforestation

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) You need an adverb or adverbial phrase after the verb because verbs are post‑modified by adverbs (e.g., "frequently", "rapidly").  
(b) Use an adjective (or attributive noun) before "imbalance" to pre‑modify the noun (e.g., "ecological imbalance").  
(c) An infinitive phrase after the verb shows purpose or result (e.g., "to sell the timber"), so use an infinitive to post‑modify the verb.  
(d) A noun used as an adjective (attributive noun) goes before "level" (e.g., "sea level") to name what kind of level.  
(e) Use the participle "being" before the past participle to form the passive progressive ("are being turned"), so a participle pre‑modifies the verb.  
(f) After verbs like "stop" you use a gerund (present participle form) as the object—so a participle like "cutting" post‑modifies the verb.  
(g) A participle (gerund or participial phrase) can begin a noun phrase that functions as subject or modifier (e.g., "Cutting trees indiscriminately…"), so use a participle to pre‑modify.  
(h) An adverbial phrase of time/place/manner (e.g., "completely", "one day", "in the future") should follow the verb to post‑modify it.  
(i) A present participle before a noun describes it (e.g., "rising temperature"), so use a participle to pre‑modify "temperature."  
(j) An infinitive phrase after "taken" expresses purpose (e.g., "to save the environment"), so use an infinitive to post‑modify the verb.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) landless/ poor (b) to work (c) their (d) working (e) day (f) to earn (g) occasionally (h) own (i) begging (j) Invalid

Explanation:
a Needs an adjective before the noun (pre-modifier) to describe "farmer" (e.g., "poor farmer").  
b Needs an infinitive after the verb to show purpose or habitual action (e.g., "to work" or "to trespass").  
c Needs a possessive pronoun to show whose daughters they were (e.g., "their daughters").  
d After "started" we use a present participle (verb+ing) to show the action they began (e.g., "working").  
e Needs an adjective before "labourers" (pre-modifier) to describe them (e.g., "young labourers").  
f Needs an infinitive of purpose after "left" to say why they left (e.g., "to earn money").  
g Needs an adverb to modify the verb "send" and show manner or frequency (e.g., "regularly" or "often").  
h Needs a pre-modifier (adjective or possessive) before the noun to specify whose or what (e.g., "their family" or "their household").  
i After "started" we again use a verb form to show the new activity—typically a present participle (e.g., "working in the village").  
j Needs an adjective before the noun "husband" (pre-modifier) to describe him (e.g., "old husband").

(b) commonly known — "commonly" একটি adverb যা passive verb "known"কে modify করে, অর্থাৎ সাধারণভাবে সবাই তাকে quack হিসেবে জানে।  
(c) qualified — "qualified" noun-এর আগে বসে doctor-কে নির্দিষ্টরূপে বোঝায় যে তিনি formal qualification নেই।  
(d) to attend patients — infinitive phraseটি ক্রিয়ার পরে কাজের উদ্দেশ্য দেখায়: তিনি dispensary-তে বসেন কেন তা নির্দেশ করে।

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) an (b) his (c) very well (d) illiterate (e) to remove (f) Removing (g) very (h) five (i) a very plous man (j) also

Explanation:
(a) an — "An" is the correct determiner because "ideal" begins with a vowel sound, so we say "an ideal student."  
(b) his — "His" is a possessive determiner that shows the lessons belong to him: "his lessons."  
(c) well — An adverb is needed after "does" to describe performance; "does well" means he performs successfully in exams.  
(d) illiterate — An adjective before "people" describes whom he teaches; "illiterate people" fits the context of removing illiteracy.  
(e) to remove illiteracy — An infinitive phrase after "wants" states his aim: "wants to remove illiteracy."  
(f) Removing — A present participle clause ("Removing illiteracy…") works as an adverbial/introductory phrase showing related action or purpose.  
(g) deeply — An intensifying adverb before the adjective: "deeply devoted" emphasizes the strength of his devotion.  
(h) five — A quantifier before "times" gives the number of times: "five times a day."  
(i) a kind man — An appositive (comma‑set phrase) gives additional identification: "His father, a kind man, supports him cordially."  
(j) always — An adverb placed before the verb to show frequency: "always supports him very much."

Question:
The people of Bangladesh have expressed their shock (a) — (post-modify the verb) at the reaction of the Pakistan Parliament. Pakistan strongly protested the execution of two (b) — (pre-modify the noun collaborators who committed crimes against humanity on their own people in 1971. There is a demand for apology from (c) — (use a noun adjective to pre-modify the noun) government for the crimes of its army during the Liberation War of Bangladesh. Recently Pakistan’s National Assembly may be within its rights (d) — (use an infinitive phrase to post modify the verb) for the execution of two collaborators.

Explanation:
Explanation: Use the correct grammatical modifier for each slot.

Pre-modifiers before nouns: use an adjective or noun-adjective to specify the noun — e.g., (b) "convicted collaborators" (shows legal status), (c) "Pakistani government" (demonym as noun-adjective), and a demonstrative like (e) "that history" (points to a specific past). 

Verbal and clause modifiers: use adverbs to post-modify verbs — e.g., (a) "strongly" modifies "expressed" — and an infinitive phrase after "within its rights" — e.g., (d) "to protest the execution" completes the idea. 

Appositive, intensifiers, possessive and manner adverb: use an appositive to rename the noun — (f) "a military-dominated state"; intensifiers to strengthen adjectives — (g) "utterly barbarous" or (g)/(i) "very/utterly weak"; a possessive to modify "birth" — (j) "its birth"; and an adverb to show manner for motion verbs — (h) "rapidly" (is going down rapidly).

Explanation:
Explanation: ক "prolific" is an adjective placed before the noun "poet" (a pre-modifier), and খ "prolifically" is an adverb that post-modifies the verb "wrote."  
গ An appositive (e.g., "the rebel poet") renames Nazrul and is set off by commas; ঘ "his" is a possessive pronoun showing ownership of "poetic flair"; and ঙ an infinitive phrase (e.g., "to inspire the masses") expresses purpose after "composed."  
চ An intensifier like "very" strengthens the adjective "melodious"; ছ an adverb such as "greatly" modifies the verb "enriched"; জ a noun used adjectivally (e.g., "world" in "world literature") qualifies "literature"; ঝ the article "a" is required before the singular countable noun "secular poet"; and ঞ an adverbial phrase like "with great passion" describes how he sang.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) a school boy (b) some/ many (c) prime/ chief (d) this (e) his (f) early (g) regularly (h) single (i) very

Explanation:
Each blank needs the modifier type placed where English grammar requires it: an appositive follows the noun (so a → "a diligent student"), and a quantifier comes before the noun (so b → "many good qualities").  
Adjectives, demonstratives and possessives pre-modify nouns (so c → "main", d → "that", e → "his"), while adverbs that modify verbs are placed after the verb (so f → "early", g → "regularly").  
Finally, use a determiner before "moment" (h → "a"), an intensifier before the adjective (i → "very"), and a descriptive pre-modifier for "boys" to show whom he avoids (j → "bad boys").

Solution:
(a) good/ different/ various (b) to lead (c) balanced (d) many/ some (e) easily/ frequently (f) our (g) same (h) eating/ taking (i) to make/ select (j) a/ any

Explanation:
Adjectives come before nouns, so (a) "nutritious foods", (c) "balanced diet" and (g) "same foods" are correct as pre-modifiers.  
Adjectives can be followed by an infinitive: (b) "to have" after "essential" and (i) "to maintain" after "easy"; use a determiner like (d) "many" for "diseases" and (j) "a" for "a nutritionist."  
Verbs are often modified by adverbs after them—(e) "easily"—and a participle phrase shows means, so (h) "by eating a balanced diet" explains how we keep fit.

Question:
Robindronath Tagore was a (a) — (pre-modify the noun) poet of Bengali literature. He was born in a (b) — (pre-modify the noun) family at Jarasako, Kolkata. He went to school (c) — (post-modify the verb) . He wrote his (d) — (pre-modify the noun) verse at the age of eight.

He also visited  the House of Parliament (h) — (post-modify the verb with an infinitive) Gladstone and John Bright’s debates on Irish rule.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) great / famous (b) renowned (c) early (d) first (e) to study in a (f) professional (g) to find (h) to listen to (i) describing / praising (j) forever

Explanation:
(a) Use an attributive adjective before the noun (e.g., "renowned" or "great") because pre-modifiers (adjectives/determiners) come before the noun they describe.  
(b) Again an adjective before "family" (e.g., "affluent" or "well-to-do") since nouns are pre-modified by adjectives in English.  
(c) Use an adverb or adverbial phrase after the verb (e.g., "regularly" or "at the age of seven") because post‑modifiers of verbs express manner, time or frequency.  
(d) Use a determiner/ordinal or adjective before "verse" (e.g., "his first verse") since ordinal/adjective pre-modifiers identify which noun is meant.  
(e) Use an infinitive after the verb to show purpose (e.g., "to study" — "went to London to study") because infinitives commonly express purpose of motion.  
(f) Place an adjective before "coach" (e.g., "a private coach" or "a Scotch coach") as nouns are described by pre-modifying adjectives.  
(g) Follow the adjective with an infinitive to show result or circumstance (e.g., "lucky to be placed with an English family") because adjectives can be complemented by infinitives.  
(h) Use an infinitive after "visited" to show purpose (e.g., "to hear Gladstone and John Bright’s debates") since infinitives often state why someone visited.  
(i) Use a present participle phrase to post-modify the verb or object (e.g., "writing about English society" or "describing English society") because present participles show simultaneous action or manner.  
(j) Add an adverbial post-modifier to the verb to show extent or result (e.g., "forever" or "for good") since adverbs/adverbial phrases commonly follow verbs to qualify them.

Once there lived a (a) ―― (pre-modify the noun) fox in a jungle. One day, while he was walking (b) ―― (post-modify the verb) through the jungle he fell into a trap and lost his tail. He felt (c) ―― (pre-modify the adjective) unhappy and sad. But the fox was very cunning. He hit upon a plan. He invited all the foxes (d) ―― (post-modify the verb with an infinitive) to a meeting. When all the foxes arrived, the fox without a tail said, “My dear friends, listen to me, please. I have discovered a (e) ―― (pre-modify the noun) thing. It is that our tails are (f) ―― (pre-modify the adjective) useless. They look ugly and dirty. So, we all should cut off our tails, shouldn’t we?” All foxes listened to the cunning fox (g) ―― (post-modify the verb). Most of them agreed (h) ―― (post-modify the verb with an infinitive) their tails. But an old and (i) ―― (pre-modify the noun) fox said to him, “My friend, your plan is nice but evil. Actually, you want to cut off our tails because you have (j) ―― (pre-modify the noun with a determiner) tail of your own.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) clever; (b) alone/ aimlessly; (c) very; (d) to come; (e) new; (f) quite; (g) attentively; (h) to cut off; (i) wise; (j) no;

Explanation:
Explanation: The blanks are filled according to their grammatical roles: adjectives that pre-modify nouns go before the noun—hence (a) "clever", (e) "strange" and (i) "wise" (and (j) uses a determiner "no" before "tail"). Adverbs that pre-modify adjectives go before the adjective—so (c) "very" unhappy and (f) "quite" useless. Verbs are post‑modified either by adverb/adverbial phrases ((b) "carelessly", (g) "attentively") or by infinitive complements ((d) "to come", (h) "to cut off"), which naturally follow the verb they modify.

Question:
It was a hot (a) — (use noun adjective to pre-modify the noun) day. A (b) — (pre-modify the noun) crow flew all over the fields looking for water. For a long time, she could not find any walk She felt (c) — (use an intensifier to pre-modify the adjective) weak, almost giving up hope. Suddenly, she saw a water jug below her. She flew (d) — (post-modify the verb) to see if there was any water inside. Yes, she could see some water inside the jug. The crow tried (e) — (use an infinitive phrase to post-modify the verb). Sadly she found that the neck was too narrow. Then she tried to push the jug down for the water to flow out. But she found (f) — (use a demonstrative to pre-modify the noun) jug too heavy.

She (i) — (pre-modify the verb) had a good idea. She started picking up the pebbles one by one dropping each filled the jug, the water level kept rising. Soon it was high (j) — (post-modify the adjective) for the crow to drink. The crow quenched its thirst and flew away.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a. summer b. thirsty c. very d. quickly e. to drink water f. that g. for a while h. Looking around i. finally/then j. enough

Explanation:
Explanation:
a–c each require specific pre-modifiers: a wants an adjective (or noun-adjective compound) before "day" (e.g., "a scorching day"), b needs a pre-modifying phrase for "crow" (an adjective or article + adjective), and c needs an intensifier (an adverb like "so" or "extremely") before "weak" to strengthen the adjective.  
d–g concern verb modification and purpose: d calls for an adverb or adverbial phrase after the verb ("flew quickly/down") to show manner, e needs an infinitive phrase to show purpose ("to get water"), f requires a demonstrative determiner before "jug" ("that jug"), and g needs a phrase after "thought" (e.g., "about what to do") to complete the idea.  
h–j finish the narrative: h uses a participle to show simultaneous action ("Looking" or "Scanning"), i needs an adverb before "had" ("suddenly had a good idea"), and j requires a post-modifying clause ("enough for the crow to drink") to indicate the degree.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:
ক "colourless" — এখানে "substance" শব্দটির আগে একটি বিশেষণ (pre-modifier) লাগে; "colourless" মানে রং নেই, তাই পাসে থাকা বাক্যের সঙ্গে মিলছে।  
খ "its" — "own" শব্দটি আগে একটি স্বত্বসূচক শব্দ (possessive) লাগে; "its own" = তার নিজের।  
গ "true" — এখানে "name" শব্দটি বর্ণনা করতে একটি উপযুক্ত বিশেষণ লাগে; "true name" বলতে অক্ষরে-অর্থে উপযুক্ত বা খাঁটি নাম বোঝায়।  
ঘ "our" — "thirst" শব্দটি আগে স্বত্বসূচক বিশেষণ লাগে; "our thirst" বলে বোঝায় আমাদের তৃষণা।  
ঙ "contaminated" — এখানে "water" পূর্বে একটি বিশেষণ লাগবে যা জানায় জলটি জীবাণুযুক্ত বা দূষিত, তাই "contaminated water" অর্থপূর্ণ।  
চ "even" — ক্রিয়া "face" এর আগে একটি ক্রিয়া-উপসর্গ (adverb/pre-modifier) এসে জোরদার করে; "may even face" মানে এমনকি সম্মুখীন হতে পারে।  
ছ "premature" — "death" শব্দটি আগে একটি বিশেষণ লাগবে যা মৃত্যুর প্রকার নির্দেশ করে; "premature death" = সময়ের আগেই মৃত্যু।  
জ "water" — এখানে একটি নাম (noun) অন্য নামকে বিশেষণ হিসেবে ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে; "water pollution" অর্থাৎ জলের দ্বারা সৃষ্ট দূষণ।  
ঝ "built" — "latrines built on ponds" এর মতো participle (past participle) ব্যবহার করে latrines‑কে পরিশিষ্টভাবে বর্ণনা করা হয়; তাই "built" মানেই "নির্মিত"।  
ঞ "public" — "awareness" এর আগে এমন একটি বিশেষণ লাগে যা কার জন্য সচেতনতা বাড়াতে হবে তা নির্দেশ করে; "public awareness" = জনসচেতনতা।

We can never forget (j) — (use a demonstrative to pre-modify the adjective phrase to post modify the verb) lovely sea birds.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Use "recently" for (a) because it is an adverb that post-modifies the verb "had gathered"; "my cousin" for (b) is an appositive that renames Zahid; and "those" for (c) and (j) are demonstratives that pre-modify the noun phrase. "Beautiful" for (d) pre-modifies "birds", "alongside" for (e) is an adverbial post-modifier of "flying", and "very" (f) and "extremely" (h) are intensifiers that strengthen the adjectives. "Feeding" for (g) is a present-participial clause showing simultaneous action, and "to stay" for (i) is an infinitive phrase that completes "decided" by expressing purpose.

She refused all the young men (j) — (use an infinitive to post-modify the verb) because she loved Othello, a noble Muslim Moor from North Africa.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: Each blank calls for a specific grammatical form that fits the role in the sentence. An appositive (a) gives identifying information after the noun and is set off by commas (e.g., "Othello, a noble Moor, ..."); an adjective (b) comes before the noun to describe it ("many valiant battles"). Adverbs can modify verbs either after the verb or verb phrase (c, h, i) — e.g., "praised him highly," "pitied him deeply," "gradually turned to love" — while some adverbs can also come before the verb to modify its manner (e) — "politely invited." A relative clause (d) follows the noun and gives essential or extra information ("Desdemona, who was Brabantio’s daughter, ..."); an intensifier (f) like "very" or "extremely" comes before an adjective to strengthen it ("extremely high"); a present participle (g) placed after the verb phrase shows simultaneous action ("had to weep, sobbing"); and an infinitive (j) after the verb can express the action being offered or denied (e.g., "to marry her" as the action the suitors wished).

Explanation:
Explanation:
These blanks test common modifier roles: intensifiers go before adjectives, adverbs before verbs (or before adjectives when needed), adjectives before nouns, and a present participle can post-modify a verb. a "very" (intensifier for "familiar"), b "commonly" (adverb before "known"), c "qualified" (pre-modifies "doctor"), d "usually" (adverb), e "charging" (present participle showing how he treats patients), f "rich" (pre-modifier), g "poorly" (adverb modifying "furnished"), h "poor" (pre-modifier), i "very" (intensifier for "few"), j "common" (pre-modifier for "people").

Explanation:
Explanation: Pre-modifiers (adjectives, determiners, possessives) go before nouns, while infinitives, adverbs and participles typically follow verbs to show purpose, manner or effect; a noun used adjectivally (like "iron") can describe another noun. So (a) "serious" fits before "concern"; (b) "to cure" is an infinitive showing purpose of "used"; (c) "completely" is an adverb modifying "has grasped"; (d) "their" is the possessive before "sadness"; (e) "some" is a pre-modifier for "people" and (f) "secretly" is an adverb after "take"; (g) "serious" again pre-modifies "harm"; (h) "making" is a participle starting the phrase "making them aware"; (i) "to eradicate" is an infinitive showing purpose; and (j) "iron" is a noun used adjectivally in "iron hand".

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Ans. (a) international/exciting/interesting; (b) our; (c) cricket; (d) Each; (e) oval in shape/large/well-maintained; (f) Two; (g) to resolve/to clear up/ to remove; (h) Getting/Having; (i) one; (j) heart and soul.

Explanation:
(a) exciting — "exciting" is an adjective placed before the noun "game" to describe its quality.

(b) any one — "any one" shows the game is not limited to a single country (indicates no single-country ownership).

(c) Test — "Test" is a noun used as a noun-adjective (noun adjunct) to modify "match" (as in "Test match").

(d) Each team's squad — "Each" is a distributive pronoun and the possessive "'s" (= team's) shows ownership, so together they pre-modify "squad."

(e) marked with boundary lines — this post-modifies "field" with a phrase that describes a required feature of the field.

(f) Two — "Two" is a numeral adjective placed before "umpires" to specify number.

(g) to resolve — the infinitive "to resolve" post-modifies "required," showing purpose (why a third umpire is needed).

(h) Seizing — "Seizing" is a participle that begins a participial phrase modifying the subject and showing action timing.

(i) any — "any" is an indefinite pronoun/determiner that pre-modifies "batter" to mean no specific batter.

Explanation:
Explanation: Each blank requires a specific kind of modifier to make the sentence grammatically and semantically correct: adjectives and possessives appear before (pre-modify) nouns to describe quality or ownership (e.g., "significant changes", "students' behaviour"); relative clauses come after a noun to give defining information (e.g., "that improve society"). Intensifiers (e.g., "much", "far") strengthen an adjective, past participles can act as adjectives either before a noun ("acquired knowledge") or after a noun as a reduced relative clause ("a person engaged civically"), and adverbs modify verbs to show manner/place/time either before or after the verb (e.g., "widely appreciated", "lies nearby"); prepositional phrases post-modify nouns to show relation or location (e.g., "in civic life"). Choosing these forms fits both meaning and grammar because they respectively show description, possession, extra information, emphasis, completed action, manner/location, and relationship.

Explanation:
Most blanks that ask for pre-modification — (a), (c), (e), (f) — take adjectives or determiners before the noun (e.g., (a) "young boy", (c) "murky canal", (e) "brave constable", (f) "own life").  
Post-modifiers attach after verbs or nouns: (b) needs a verb complement or adverbial (e.g., "started running" or "started to run frantically"), (h) should be a post-modifying phrase like a participle ("people standing by the canal"), (i) an adverb ("praised him warmly"), and (j) a prepositional post-modifier ("a model for others").  
Use a present participle phrase for (d) ("wasting no time, he jumped...") and an intensifier before the adjective for (g) ("so kind" or "very kind") because participles and intensifiers correctly modify the required words in those positions.

On a snorkeling trip to a nearby coral reef I had several small surprises. During the swim I saw (a) — near the surface. Our guide, (b) —, pointed out several colorful species. We swam alongside (c) — schools of fish. The whole day left me with (d) —.

Options:
ক. (a) — (post modify the verb with a to-infinitive)
খ. (b) — (post modify the noun with an appositive)
গ. (c) — (use a demonstrative to pre-modify the noun)
ঘ. (d) — (use a present participle to pre-modify the noun)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক I saw a juvenile sea turtle rise to the surface to breathe near the surface.
খ Our guide, an experienced marine biologist, pointed out several colorful species.
গ We swam alongside those shimmering schools of fish.
ঘ The whole day left me with lasting memories.

Explanation:
ক (post-modify the verb with a to-infinitive): The clause 'rise to the surface to breathe' follows the action and contains a to-infinitive 'to breathe' that indicates purpose. It functions as a post-modifier explaining why the turtle rose—thus it post-modifies the verb phrase describing what was seen.

খ (appositive to post-modify the noun): 'Our guide, an experienced marine biologist,' uses an appositive ('an experienced marine biologist') after the noun to give identifying information. This is the standard way to add non-essential descriptive detail.

গ (demonstrative to pre-modify the noun): 'Those shimmering schools of fish' uses the demonstrative 'those' before the noun phrase to point to particular schools observed. The adjective 'shimmering' adds description and remains after the demonstrative.

ঘ (present participle to pre-modify the noun): 'Lasting memories' uses the present participle 'lasting' (an -ing form functioning as an adjective) to pre-modify the noun 'memories'. Present participles often express an ongoing or enduring quality and are common in such noun phrases.

These answers show how to place infinitives, appositives, demonstratives, and present participles in natural descriptive sentences about a snorkeling trip.

Options:
ক. (a) — (post modify the verb with an adverbial clause)
খ. (b) — (pre-modify the noun with an intensifier to pre-modify the adjective)
গ. (c) — (use a present participle to pre-modify the noun)
ঘ. (d) — (use a demonstrative to pre-modify the adjective phrase to post modify the noun)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক We noticed the sky shifting colors as the sun dipped below the horizon.
খ An exceptionally skilled boatman steered us carefully through the channels.
গ We drifted past meandering creeks.
ঘ The distant cry, that eerie sound, made us hold our breath for a moment.

Explanation:
ক (post-modifying the verb with an adverbial clause): The phrase 'as the sun dipped below the horizon' follows and modifies the verb 'noticed', adding temporal/contextual information. Adverbial clauses like this tell when or under what conditions the noticing occurred.

খ (intensifier to pre-modify the adjective before the noun): The structure 'an exceptionally skilled boatman' places the intensifier 'exceptionally' before the adjective 'skilled', which in turn pre-modifies the noun 'boatman'. This increases the degree of the adjective.

গ (present participle to pre-modify the noun): 'Meandering' is a present participle (-ing form) used as an adjective to pre-modify the noun 'creeks' (meandering creeks). Present participles commonly describe ongoing quality or appearance.

ঘ (demonstrative to pre-modify the adjective phrase to post-modify the noun): The demonstrative 'that' pre-modifies the adjective phrase 'eerie sound'. Placing it in commas after 'The distant cry' makes it a post-modifying appositive: 'The distant cry, that eerie sound, ...' This construction both identifies the cry and attaches the demonstrative-modified phrase as extra information.

Each filled blank demonstrates the requested grammatical device while keeping the sentences natural and coherent.

ক (post modify the verb): The blank follows the verb phrase 'I noticed'. To post-modify the verb, I added a trailing clause 'that I will always remember', which qualifies the experience I noticed—this is a verb phrase modifier giving additional information about the action. Example: 'I noticed X that I will always remember.'

খ (appositive to post modify the noun): An appositive renames or gives extra information about a noun and is usually set off by commas. 'Mr. Karim, a local tea expert,' is an appositive that further identifies 'my guide.' This fits the instruction to post-modify the noun with an appositive.

গ (demonstrative to pre-modify the noun): The demonstrative 'those' placed before 'diligent workers' pre-modifies the noun phrase, making it specific: 'those diligent workers'. Demonstratives (this/that/these/those) are used to point to particular people or things.

ঘ (intensifier to pre-modify the adjective): The intensifier 'very' is placed directly before the adjective 'peaceful' to strengthen it: 'very peaceful.' Intensifiers (very, extremely, truly, etc.) modify adjectives to increase emphasis.

Overall the filled passage maintains natural flow while illustrating the requested grammatical devices: a post-modifying clause on the verb, an appositive after a noun, a demonstrative as a pre-modifier, and an intensifier before an adjective.

Question:
Television serves as both an (ক) — (pre-modify the noun) entertainer and an informal teacher. Well-made documentaries provide (খ) — (pre-modify the noun) content that expands viewers' knowledge. Watching quality programs can help people (গ) — (post-modify the verb with an infinitive) about cultures, history, and science. To get the most benefit, one should watch shows (ঘ) — (post-modify the verb) and avoid excessive viewing.

Options:
ক. Select an adjective to pre-modify 'entertainer' in (ক).
খ. Select an adjective to pre-modify 'content' in (খ).
গ. Give an infinitive phrase to complete 'help people (গ)'.
ঘ. Provide an adverbial phrase to complete 'watch shows (ঘ)'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: versatile / powerful / influential
খ উত্তর: informative / educational / enriching
গ উত্তর: to learn / to discover / to gain insight (e.g., 'to learn about cultures, history, and science')
ঘ উত্তর: in moderation / selectively / critically

Explanation:
ক: 'versatile', 'powerful', or 'influential' all work well before 'entertainer'—they emphasize television's range and impact as a medium. খ: 'informative', 'educational', or 'enriching' aptly describe the nature of documentary or educational content and naturally pre-modify 'content'. গ: An infinitive such as 'to learn', 'to discover', or 'to gain insight' correctly follows 'help people' and indicates what viewers gain from watching quality programs. ঘ: 'in moderation', 'selectively', or 'critically' are appropriate adverbial phrases advising how to watch shows to maximize benefits and minimize harms; they function as post-modifiers of 'watch'. Each proposed word/phrase fits both the grammar (pre- vs. post-modification) and the intended meaning of the sentence.

Question:
A public library serves a community in many ways. It is a (ক) — (pre-modify the noun) source of books and information for all ages. Besides lending, libraries provide (খ) — (pre-modify the noun) material like archives and reference works that support research. Regular study in such a place helps a student (গ) — (post-modify the verb with an infinitive) language skills and critical thinking. To benefit most, patrons should consult the catalogue and use resources (ঘ) — (post-modify the verb).

Options:
ক. Choose a single-word adjective to pre-modify 'source' in (ক).
খ. Choose an adjective to pre-modify 'material' in (খ).
গ. Provide an infinitive phrase to complete 'helps a student (গ)'.
ঘ. Provide an adverbial phrase to complete 'use resources (ঘ)'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: invaluable / indispensable
খ উত্তর: reference / archival
গ উত্তর: to broaden / to improve (e.g., 'to broaden language skills and critical thinking')
ঘ উত্তর: regularly / responsibly / with care (e.g., 'regularly' or 'in a disciplined manner')

Explanation:
ক: 'invaluable' or 'indispensable' fits as a pre-modifier of 'source' because a public library is extremely useful and necessary; 'valuable' would also work but 'invaluable' emphasizes greater importance. খ: 'reference' or 'archival' correctly describes the kinds of materials (e.g., reference books, archives) that support research—these are typical noun modifiers before 'material'. গ: An infinitive phrase is needed after 'helps a student' to indicate purpose or result. 'to broaden' or 'to improve' followed by the objects ('language skills and critical thinking') correctly completes the idea. ঘ: An adverbial phrase such as 'regularly', 'responsibly', or 'with care' appropriately modifies 'use resources' to advise how patrons should make use of library materials. Each choice matches grammatical function (pre-modifier vs. post-modifier) and the semantic intent of the sentence.

Question:
A reliable internet connection has become a (ক) — (pre-modify the noun) backbone for education and commerce. It offers a (খ) — (pre-modify the noun) platform where people share ideas and collaborate. Students frequently turn to online portals (গ) — (post-modify the verb with an infinitive) lectures, assignments, and research papers. For privacy and safety, users should browse websites (ঘ) — (post-modify the verb) and keep their data secure.

Options:
ক. Pick an adjective to pre-modify 'backbone' in (ক).
খ. Pick an adjective to pre-modify 'platform' in (খ).
গ. Give an infinitive phrase to post-modify 'turn to online portals (গ)'.
ঘ. Provide an adverb/adverbial phrase to post-modify 'browse websites (ঘ)'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: crucial / vital / indispensable
খ উত্তর: digital / virtual / interactive
গ উত্তর: to access / to stream / to consult (e.g., 'to access lectures and research papers')
ঘ উত্তর: cautiously / carefully / securely

Explanation:
ক: 'crucial', 'vital', or 'indispensable' suitably pre-modify 'backbone' to stress how essential the internet is to modern systems. খ: 'digital', 'virtual', or 'interactive' accurately describe the nature of an online 'platform'—these adjectives fit naturally before the noun. গ: An infinitive phrase such as 'to access', 'to stream', or 'to consult' completes 'turn to online portals' by indicating purpose—students use portals in order to obtain lectures, assignments, or papers. ঘ: Adverbs like 'cautiously', 'carefully', or 'securely' guide how one should browse websites to maintain privacy and security; they function properly as post-modifiers of the verb 'browse'. Each answer respects both grammatical function and expected meaning in context.

Question:

Mobile devices have become (a) - (pre-modify the adjective with an intensifier) popular in modern life. People use them (b) - (post-modify the verb with an adverb of frequency) to check news and messages. Their (c) - (pre-modify the noun with an adjective) features make daily tasks easier. We rely on them (d) - (post-modify the verb with an infinitive) stay connected with family and work.

Options:
ক. (a) pre-modify the adjective with an intensifier
খ. (b) post-modify the verb with an adverb of frequency
গ. (c) pre-modify the noun with an adjective
ঘ. (d) post-modify the verb with an infinitive


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক extremely

খ frequently

গ advanced

ঘ to stay connected

Explanation:
ক: 'extremely' is an intensifier that pre-modifies the adjective 'popular' to emphasize degree (extremely popular).

খ: 'frequently' is an adverb of frequency that can post-modify the verb phrase 'use them' (use them frequently) to indicate how often the action happens.

গ: 'advanced' is an adjective that pre-modifies the noun 'features' (advanced features), describing the nature of those features.

ঘ: 'to stay connected' is an infinitive phrase expressing purpose and can follow the verb 'rely on them' (rely on them to stay connected). The infinitive here indicates why we rely on mobile devices.

Question:
A balanced diet is essential for growth and immunity. Nutritionists urge variety in meals. People should eat fruits and vegetables (a) — (use a quantifier to pre-modify the noun phrase) to get vitamins and fiber. Sadly, (b) — (use a possessive to pre-modify the noun) processed food available in markets often contains hidden sugar and salt. This (c) — (use a noun-adjective to modify the noun) processing reduces the natural nutrient content. (d) — (use a gerund) nutrition education and clearer labels will help shoppers make healthier choices.

Options:
ক. Fill (a): use a quantifier to pre-modify the noun phrase
খ. Fill (b): use a possessive to pre-modify the noun
গ. Fill (c): use a noun-adjective to modify the noun
ঘ. Fill (d): use a gerund


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক plenty of

খ our

গ factory (processing)

ঘ Promoting

Explanation:
ক: 'Plenty of' is a quantifier that pre-modifies a plural noun phrase like 'fruits and vegetables' to indicate a sufficient amount: 'eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.' Alternatives like 'many' or 'a lot of' could also work, but 'plenty of' emphasizes adequacy.

খ: The possessive 'our' refers to foods commonly bought and consumed by the people in question: 'our processed food often contains...' This fulfills the requirement for a possessive determiner.

গ: A noun used attributively (a noun-adjective) can modify another noun; 'factory processing' uses the noun 'factory' attributively to modify 'processing.' The phrase 'factory processing reduces...' conveys that industrial-scale/mechanized processing diminishes nutrients. Other noun-adjectives like 'industrial' (adjective) or 'home' (noun used attributively) could be used depending on nuance.

ঘ: The gerund 'Promoting' (from the verb 'promote') functions as a noun-like subject at the start of the clause: 'Promoting nutrition education and clearer labels will help...' This meets the instruction to use a gerund and fits the intended meaning.

Physical activity supports long life. Health experts recommend daily movement. People should include exercise (a) — (use a present participle to post-modify the noun) in their routines. For (b) — (use a determiner to pre-modify the noun phrase) elderly, doctor consultation before intense workouts is wise. Yet, (c) — (use an adjective to pre-modify the noun) unhealthy habits like prolonged sitting are common. (d) — (use an intensifier to pre-modify the adverb) seriously, lack of exercise harms cardiovascular health.

Options:
ক. Fill (a): use a present participle to post-modify the noun 'exercise'
খ. Fill (b): use a determiner to pre-modify the noun phrase
গ. Fill (c): use an adjective to pre-modify the noun
ঘ. Fill (d): use an intensifier to pre-modify the adverb


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক including brisk walking

খ the elderly

গ unhealthy

ঘ very seriously

Explanation:
ক: The instruction requests a present participle phrase that post-modifies the noun 'exercise.' A participial phrase like 'including brisk walking' uses the present participle 'including' and gives a concrete example that modifies 'exercise.'

খ: The determiner 'the' pre-modifies the noun phrase 'elderly' to refer to that specific group: 'the elderly.' Other determiners (e.g., 'some', 'many') would change meaning; 'the' is natural here because medical guidance is often recommended for that defined group.

গ: The blank asks for an adjective modifying 'habits.' 'Unhealthy' directly describes habits that are harmful to health and fits the context.

ঘ: An intensifier like 'very' modifies the adverb 'seriously' to strengthen it: 'very seriously.' This meets the requirement that an intensifier pre-modify an adverb and fits the sentence meaning.

Question:
Safe drinking water is a fundamental need. Communities collect water from various sources. People must obtain water (a) — (use an infinitive phrase to post-modify the verb) to keep themselves healthy. In many regions, (b) — (use a quantifier to pre-modify the noun phrase) families lack access to treated water. Often, (c) — (use a possessive to pre-modify the noun) local wells become contaminated after floods. (d) — (use a gerund) distribution of clean water and repairing pipes are top priorities for public health.

Options:
ক. Fill (a): use an infinitive phrase to post-modify the verb
খ. Fill (b): use a quantifier to pre-modify the noun phrase
গ. Fill (c): use a possessive to pre-modify the noun
ঘ. Fill (d): use a gerund


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক to stay healthy

খ many

গ their

ঘ Ensuring

Explanation:
ক: The blank follows a verb phrase describing why people must obtain water. An infinitive phrase expressing purpose fits well: 'to stay healthy' (infinitive 'to stay' + adjective 'healthy').

খ: The sentence asks for a quantifier pre-modifying the noun phrase 'families lack access...'. 'Many' is a common quantifier for countable groups and fits the meaning: 'many families.' Other possible quantifiers (e.g., 'several', 'most') could also work depending on nuance.

গ: The blank calls for a possessive to pre-modify 'local wells.' 'Their' refers back to the communities or families mentioned and correctly forms the possessive determiner: 'their local wells.'

ঘ: The sentence begins a clause listing priorities and needs a gerund (a noun form of a verb) to act as the subject. 'Ensuring' (from the verb 'ensure') functions as a gerund here: 'Ensuring distribution of clean water... are top priorities.' Note: subject-verb agreement may require rephrasing ('Ensuring... is a top priority') but 'Ensuring' correctly supplies the requested gerund form.

খ. (b) — (use quantifier to pre-modify the noun)
গ. (c) — (use a noun-adjective to pre-modify the noun)
ঘ. (d) — (post-modify the adjective)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক indispensable / essential / multifunctional খ a wide range of / numerous / countless গ smartphone / mobile (as noun-adjectives: 'smartphone battery', 'mobile battery') ঘ when fitted with advanced sensors / thanks to sophisticated image-processing / even in challenging conditions

Explanation:
ক: A pre-modifying adjective before 'tools' should convey how central phones are: 'indispensable', 'essential' or 'multifunctional' are appropriate. খ: Quantifiers like 'a wide range of', 'numerous' or 'countless' correctly pre-modify 'choices' (plural). গ: 'Smartphone' and 'mobile' often act as noun-adjectives to describe components (e.g., 'smartphone battery'); this is a common compound usage in tech contexts. ঘ: Post-modifying an adjective involves adding a phrase after it to explain or qualify it. Phrases such as 'when fitted with advanced sensors', 'thanks to sophisticated image-processing', or 'even in challenging conditions' explain why photos are 'impressive in low light'—they come after the adjective to add detail and are natural in technical description.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক comprehensive / detailed / authoritative খ several / various / a number of গ weekend / Sunday (as noun-adjectives: 'weekend edition', 'Sunday edition') ঘ which are also / that are also published online / available on the website

Explanation:
ক: The blank asks for an adjective before 'coverage'—words like 'comprehensive', 'detailed' or 'authoritative' describe the nature of reporting. খ: Quantifiers such as 'several', 'various' or 'a number of' correctly modify the plural noun 'sections'. গ: 'Weekend' and 'Sunday' function as noun-adjectives when placed before 'edition' or 'supplement' (e.g., 'weekend edition'). ঘ: A post-modifier is a phrase or clause that comes after the noun to add information—'which are also published online' or 'that are available on the website' properly modify 'stories' or 'features' to indicate secondary availability. These choices preserve natural collocations used in journalism and publishing.

Solution:
ক widespread / highly relevant / topical খ numerous / many / a wide range of গ online / web-based / cloud (as noun-adjectives: online services, web-based services, cloud services) ঘ that can be accessed for free / available free of charge / offered at no cost

Explanation:
ক: 'pre-modify the noun' asks for an adjective before 'relevance' or the noun it qualifies. 'Widespread', 'highly relevant' or 'topical' fit naturally as attributive adjectives describing the scope or importance of content. খ: A quantifier precedes a plural noun: 'numerous', 'many', or the phrase 'a wide range of' correctly quantifies 'platforms'. গ: A noun-adjective is a noun used to modify another noun (e.g., 'online services', 'web-based services', 'cloud services'); these are common collocations for internet offerings. ঘ: A post-modifier for a noun is a clause or phrase after the noun (e.g., 'that can be accessed for free', 'available free of charge'); these show how the modules are provided. Note: for the final sentence in the context, the blank (e) would take the article 'a' before 'problem' (i.e., 'a problem'), because 'problem' is a countable singular noun and needs an article.

Modern classrooms increasingly depend on technology to enhance learning. The passage below has four blanks; fill each blank with the kind of modifier indicated in parentheses.

Modern classrooms increasingly rely on (a) - (use an adjective to pre-modify the noun) tools to support student learning. Teachers adapt (b) - (use a possessive to pre-modify the noun) materials to meet diverse needs. These digital platforms, (c) - (use a relative clause to post-modify the noun) make assessment and feedback more immediate.

Options:
ক. Fill (a): provide an adjective to pre-modify the noun 'tools'.
খ. Fill (b): provide a possessive to pre-modify the noun 'materials'.
গ. Fill (c): provide a relative clause to post-modify the noun 'platforms'.
ঘ. Fill (d): provide an adverb to post-modify the verb 'integrated'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: adaptive

খ Answer: their

গ Answer: which provide real-time feedback

ঘ Answer: seamlessly

Explanation:
ক (adaptive): 'Adaptive tools' means tools that adjust to learners' needs; 'adaptive' is an adjective placed before the noun 'tools'.

খ (their): A possessive like 'their' (teachers adapt their materials) shows ownership/association and correctly pre-modifies 'materials'. 'Our' or 'the' could also work depending on perspective, but 'their' fits the sentence where teachers adapt materials belonging to or used by them.

গ (which provide real-time feedback): A relative clause post-modifies 'platforms' and gives essential information about what the platforms do. 'which provide real-time feedback' clearly describes the platforms and is grammatically correct.

ঘ (seamlessly): An adverb post-modifies the verb 'integrated' and describes how technology should be integrated into plans. 'Seamlessly integrated' is a common collocation indicating smooth incorporation. Other adverbs like 'carefully' or 'thoughtfully' would also be acceptable depending on nuance.

ঘ. Fill (d): a prepositional phrase to post-modify the verb 'aim'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: comprehensive

খ Answer: our

গ Answer: widely adopted

ঘ Answer: at restoring local ecosystems

Explanation:
ক (comprehensive): 'Comprehensive policies' means policies that cover many aspects of conservation; 'comprehensive' is an adjective placed before 'policies'.

খ (our): A possessive like 'our' emphasizes collective ownership and responsibility for habitats; it correctly pre-modifies the noun 'responsibility'. Alternatives could be 'their' or 'community's' depending on perspective.

গ (widely adopted): 'Adopted' is a past participle used before 'practices' to describe practices that have been taken up; combined with 'widely' it specifies scope: 'widely adopted practices'.

ঘ (at restoring local ecosystems): A prepositional phrase such as 'at restoring local ecosystems' post-modifies the verb 'aim' and indicates the goal of the restoration projects. Other acceptable phrases: 'toward restoring biodiversity' or 'at rebuilding habitat connectivity'.

খ. Fill (b): a possessive to pre-modify 'schedule'.
গ. Fill (c): a relative clause to post-modify 'benefits'.
ঘ. Fill (d): an intensifier to pre-modify the adjective 'important'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: balanced

খ Answer: their

গ Answer: which can be observed over the long term

ঘ Answer: far

Explanation:
ক (balanced): 'Balanced diet' is a standard collocation; 'balanced' is an adjective placed before 'diet' and conveys nutritional completeness.

খ (their): The possessive 'their' pre-modifies 'schedule' to indicate an individual's own routine. Alternatives like 'a' or 'one's' could work, but 'their' is natural and gender-neutral.

গ (which can be observed over the long term): This relative clause post-modifies 'benefits' and explains that these benefits become measurable over longer periods. It ties cause and effect clearly to the noun it follows.

ঘ (far): 'Far' is an intensifier used before the adjective 'important' (far more important) to strengthen the degree; 'much' would be another common choice. The sentence implies 'far more important than most people realise.'

Question:
Urban noise has risen with increasing traffic and construction. City noise is a (a) — (pre-modify the noun with an adjective) concern affecting millions. Drivers often honk (b) — (post-modify the verb with an adverb) in traffic jams. Residents install double-glazed windows (c) — (post-modify the verb with an infinitive) outside noise. Airports and industrial zones, (d) — (use an appositive), contribute significantly to constant background noise.

Options:
ক. Fill (a): pre-modify the noun with an adjective
খ. Fill (b): post-modify the verb with an adverb
গ. Fill (c): post-modify the verb with an infinitive
ঘ. Fill (d): use an appositive


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক major / growing / persistent concernখ incessantly / incessantly (alternatively: frequently / angrily) — e.g., 'incessantly' emphasizes non-stop honkingগ to block out / to reduce / to keep outঘ high-noise facilities such as hubs of constant air and mechanical activity / noisy transport and industrial hubs

Explanation:
ক: The adjective must come before 'concern' and indicate severity or trend: 'major', 'growing', or 'persistent' all fit. খ: An adverb after 'honk' describes manner/frequency; 'incessantly' stresses continuous honking, while 'frequently' or 'angrily' are alternatives depending on nuance. গ: The infinitive phrase post-modifies the verb 'install' and gives the purpose of installing windows: 'to block out', 'to reduce', or 'to keep out' are natural. ঘ: An appositive restates or clarifies the preceding noun phrase ('Airports and industrial zones'); acceptable appositives include 'high-noise facilities such as hubs of constant air and mechanical activity' or 'noisy transport and industrial hubs' which explain what those places are.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক biodiverse / rich / vital ecosystemsখ rapidly / indiscriminately / extensivelyগ to make way for / to convert into / to clear forঘ the world's largest tropical rainforest and a key carbon sink / a vast basin of biodiversity and carbon storage

Explanation:
ক: The adjective must pre-modify 'ecosystems' — 'biodiverse' or 'rich' highlights species variety; 'vital' emphasizes ecological importance. খ: The adverb post-modifies 'removed' and indicates manner or scale: 'rapidly' shows speed, 'indiscriminately' stresses lack of care, 'extensively' denotes scope. গ: The infinitive phrase after 'clear land' should indicate purpose/result: 'to make way for', 'to convert into', or 'to clear for' followed by the intended land use (e.g., cattle ranching). ঘ: The appositive renames or explains 'The Amazon rainforest'—phrases like 'the world's largest tropical rainforest and a key carbon sink' or 'a vast basin of biodiversity and carbon storage' both clarify its significance.

ক. Fill (a): pre-modify the noun with an adjective
খ. Fill (b): post-modify the verb with an adverb

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a serious / severe / pervasive threatখ gradually / progressively / repeatedlyগ to break down into / to split into / to reduce toঘ the huge floating plastic accumulation in the North Pacific / a massive concentration of debris in the ocean

Explanation:
ক: The blank modifies 'threats' before the noun, so adjectives like 'serious', 'severe', or 'pervasive' suit the context; each describes the degree or scope of the problem. খ: This blank post-modifies the verb 'fragment' (or 'break') — adverbs such as 'gradually' or 'progressively' describe the manner/timeframe of fragmentation; 'repeatedly' could also work if the emphasis is on ongoing action. গ: The blank asks for an infinitive phrase that follows the verb and explains purpose/result: 'to break down into', 'to split into', or 'to reduce to' correctly show that manufacturers produce smaller pieces. ঘ: An appositive renames or explains the noun 'The Great Pacific Garbage Patch'; examples include 'the huge floating plastic accumulation in the North Pacific' or 'a massive concentration of debris in the ocean', which restate and clarify the term.

Question:
Health advisories warn about mercury levels in commonly eaten fish from the coastal area. Authorities want clear labels and instructions for consumers. Provide suitable modifiers and phrases to construct advisory statements.

Options:
ক. Use a demonstrative to pre-modify the noun 'fish'.
খ. Use an adjective to pre-modify the noun 'level' (describing mercury concentration).
গ. Use an intensifier to pre-modify the adjective 'dangerous'.
ঘ. Post-modify the verb with an infinitive phrase giving consumer advice.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক these / those / the local
খ elevated / high / dangerous
গ particularly / extremely / especially
ঘ to avoid consuming large species / to limit intake to once a week / to seek alternative protein sources

Explanation:
ক: Demonstratives 'these' or 'those' point to particular fish (e.g., 'those fish from the bay have high mercury'). 'The local' can be used as a determiner in context ('the local fish').

খ: Adjectives like 'elevated', 'high', or 'dangerous' describe the 'level' of mercury. 'Elevated' is common in scientific advisories; 'high' is plain language; 'dangerous' communicates risk.

গ: Intensifiers such as 'particularly', 'extremely', or 'especially' strengthen 'dangerous' (e.g., 'particularly dangerous for pregnant women'). They indicate higher degree or special concern.

ঘ: An infinitive phrase after a verb gives recommended consumer actions: 'avoid consuming large species' (specific avoidance), 'limit intake to once a week' (quantified restriction), or 'seek alternative protein sources' (practical advice). These infinitives express purpose and recommended behavior.

A cluster of villages reports illness after consuming vegetables from local markets. Investigations show pesticide residues above safe limits. Fill in appropriate modifiers or phrases to articulate warnings and observations.

Options:
ক. Use a quantifier to pre-modify the noun 'markets'.
খ. Use a possessive to pre-modify the noun 'produce'.
গ. Use a noun-adjective to pre-modify the noun 'farmers'.
ঘ. Use a participle to post-modify the noun 'vegetables'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক several / many / a number of / some
খ local / farmers' / the village's
গ small-scale farmers / subsistence farmers / local farmers
ঘ contaminated / tested positive / affected

Explanation:
ক: Quantifiers such as 'several', 'many', 'some', or 'a number of' modify 'markets' to indicate quantity without exact numbers (e.g., 'several markets showed contaminated produce').

খ: Possessives like 'farmers'' or noun-based modifiers like 'local' or 'the village's' show ownership or origin of the produce (e.g., 'farmers' produce' or 'local produce').

গ: A noun-adjective like 'small-scale farmers' or 'subsistence farmers' specifies what kind of farmers — a compound noun-adjective provides concise description of their status or method.

ঘ: Participles (past or present) post-modify nouns to give additional information. 'Contaminated vegetables', 'vegetables tested positive', or 'affected vegetables' all use participial forms to describe the state/result associated with the vegetables.

Question:
Lead contamination has been discovered in the river that supplies water to several fishing villages. Local people complain of skin rashes and low fish catches. Complete the requested modifiers or phrases to make meaningful sentences about the situation.

Options:
ক. Use an adjective to pre-modify the noun 'metal' describing lead (one-word).
খ. Use an intensifier to pre-modify the adjective 'toxic'.
গ. Use a demonstrative to pre-modify the noun 'river'.
ঘ. Post-modify the verb with an infinitive phrase advising action.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক toxic / heavy-metal
খ extremely / very / highly
গ this / that / the nearby
ঘ to stop contamination / to test the water regularly / to warn the villagers

Explanation:
ক: 'Lead' is commonly described as a 'toxic' or 'heavy-metal' — both are adjectives that suitably pre-modify the noun 'metal'. 'Toxic' directly conveys harm; 'heavy-metal' specifies the class.

খ: Intensifiers such as 'extremely', 'very', or 'highly' strengthen the adjective 'toxic' (e.g., 'extremely toxic'), indicating the degree of danger.

গ: Demonstratives like 'this' or 'that', or determiners such as 'the nearby', can pre-modify 'river' to point out the specific water body ('this river is contaminated'). Use 'this' for something close/recent, 'that' for more distant.

ঘ: Post-modifying a verb with an infinitive phrase gives recommended actions: 'take steps to stop contamination', 'monitor the water to test it regularly', 'issue warnings to inform villagers' — each infinitive phrase (to + verb) explains purpose or intended action.

Question:
There once lived a (a) ―― (pre-modify the noun) rabbit in a meadow. One bright morning, while he was hopping (b) ―― (post-modify the verb) across the grass he spotted a small glass bead and thought it might be a jewel. He felt (c) ―― (pre-modify the adjective) excited and curious. He decided to invite all the meadow creatures (d) ―― (post-modify the verb with an infinitive) to come and see his discovery.

Options:
ক. (a) ―― (pre-modify the noun)
খ. (b) ―― (post-modify the verb)
গ. (c) ―― (pre-modify the adjective)
ঘ. (d) ―― (post-modify the verb with an infinitive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক timid
Reason: 'timid' is an adjective placed before the noun 'rabbit' to describe its nature.

খ happily
Reason: 'happily' is an adverb placed after the verb 'hopping' to post-modify the action.

গ very
Reason: 'very' is a degree adverb that pre-modifies the adjective 'excited' to strengthen it.

ঘ to examine
Reason: the infinitive phrase 'to examine' post-modifies the verb 'invite' by specifying purpose (invite ... to examine).

Explanation:
Choices and reasoning:
- ক (pre-modify the noun): A pre-modifier of a noun is typically an adjective that comes immediately before the noun. 'Timid' fits the context of a small rabbit and directly modifies 'rabbit'.
- খ (post-modify the verb): Post-modifying a verb in English often uses adverbs placed after the main verb (or after the verb phrase). 'Hopping happily' places the adverb after the verb to describe how he hopped.
- গ (pre-modify the adjective): Words like 'very', 'quite', 'extremely' are degree adverbs that come before adjectives to change intensity. 'Very excited' is natural here.
- ঘ (post-modify the verb with an infinitive): An infinitive after verbs like 'invite' explains purpose or intention: 'invite them to examine' explains why he invited them.
All answers were chosen to match grammatical positions (pre-modifier before a noun or adjective; adverb after a verb; infinitive to state purpose) and to fit the story's tone.

Question:
In a quiet village there lived a (a) ―― (pre-modify the noun) gardener who loved his roses. He tended them (b) ―― (post-modify the verb) every morning with care. The blooms were (c) ―― (pre-modify the adjective) wonderfully fragrant. One day he told his neighbor (d) ―― (post-modify the verb with an infinitive) to come early and smell them.

Options:
ক. (a) ―― (pre-modify the noun)
খ. (b) ―― (post-modify the verb)
গ. (c) ―― (pre-modify the adjective)
ঘ. (d) ―― (post-modify the verb with an infinitive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক diligent
Reason: 'diligent' is an adjective placed before 'gardener' to show his careful habit of tending the roses.

খ daily
Reason: 'daily' is an adverb that follows the verb phrase 'tended them' to indicate frequency (post-modifying the verb).

গ incredibly
Reason: 'incredibly' is a degree adverb that pre-modifies the adjective 'fragrant' to emphasize the intensity of the scent.

ঘ to appreciate
Reason: 'to appreciate' is an infinitive that follows 'told' to indicate the purpose of his request — he told his neighbor to come early in order 'to appreciate' the roses' scent.

Explanation:
Detailed reasoning:
- ক: A pre-modifier of a noun (an adjective directly before it) tells us about the person. 'Diligent gardener' succinctly describes someone attentive to plants.
- খ: Adverbs of frequency or manner like 'daily' can come after the verb to post-modify it. 'Tended them daily' is natural and specifies how often he cared for them.
- গ: Degree adverbs such as 'incredibly', 'very', 'extremely' come before adjectives. 'Incredibly fragrant' heightens the sensory image.
- ঘ: After verbs that report speech or instruction ('told', 'asked'), an infinitive explains the action requested: 'told his neighbor to appreciate' indicates the intended result of coming early.

ক. (a) ―― (pre-modify the noun)
খ. (b) ―― (post-modify the verb)
গ. (c) ―― (pre-modify the adjective)
ঘ. (d) ―― (post-modify the verb with an infinitive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক weary
Reason: 'weary' is an adjective placed before 'merchant' to describe his tired condition after travel.

খ purposely
Reason: 'purposely' functions as an adverb that can follow the verb phrase 'walked' to indicate intention (he walked purposely among the crowd).

গ highly
Reason: 'highly' is a degree adverb that pre-modifies the adjective 'tempting' to indicate strong attraction.

ঘ to secure
Reason: the infinitive 'to secure' follows 'asked' to express what he requested his apprentice to do — it post-modifies the verb by stating purpose/command.

Explanation:
Why these choices work:
- ক: Pre-modifiers for nouns are adjectives that come directly before the noun. 'Weary merchant' immediately conveys the merchant's state and suits the travel context.
- খ: Post-modifying verbs by adverbs placed after the verb (or verb phrase) indicate manner or intention. 'Walked purposely' tells us he did so with intent to attract customers.
- গ: Degree adverbs like 'highly', 'extremely', 'quite' come before adjectives to intensify them. 'Highly tempting' shows strong appeal.
- ঘ: After verbs like 'asked', an infinitive ('to lock up', 'to secure') specifies the requested action. 'To secure' is concise and matches 'lock up the stall securely'.
Each answer respects grammatical position (pre-modifier before noun/adjective; adverb after verb; infinitive for purpose/request) and fits the narrative.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

Explanation:
ক — 'a devoted field-researcher' is an appositive phrase that post-modifies 'Professor Mira', giving extra identifying detail. It is enclosed by commas: 'Professor Mira, a devoted field-researcher,'.

খ — 'sheer' is an adjective placed before 'cliffs' to describe their steepness; this is a standard pre-modifying adjective: 'sheer cliffs'.

গ — 'deeply' is an adverb placed after the verb 'admired' to indicate the intensity of admiration: 'admired deeply'. Positioning an adverb after a verb is appropriate for degree/manner modification.

খ — 'daring' is an adjective placed before the noun 'voyages' to pre-modify it. Adjectives typically come before the nouns they modify in English: 'daring voyages'.

গ — 'universally' is an adverb that post-modifies the verb 'admired' by coming after it: 'admired universally'. Adverbs can modify verbs and, when placed after the verb, they give information about extent or manner.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক trusted / experienced / compassionate
খ widely / deeply / greatly
গ with gentle care and steady hands / supporting the mother physically and emotionally / following traditional practices adapted to safety
ঘ limited / basic / minimal

Explanation:
ক: An adjective that comes before 'caregiver' is required; 'trusted', 'experienced' and 'compassionate' all suitably describe a midwife's relation to families.

খ: An adverb pre-modifying 'trusted' is needed. 'Widely', 'deeply' or 'greatly' indicate the extent of trust.

গ: The instruction asks for a participle phrase to post-modify the verb 'performs'. Phrases such as 'with gentle care and steady hands', 'supporting the mother physically and emotionally', or 'following traditional practices adapted to safety' describe how she conducts deliveries.

ঘ: The blank asks for an adjective before 'equipment' meaning not much or simple; 'limited', 'basic' or 'minimal' indicate scarce resources and justify reliance on traditional remedies.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক itinerant / mobile / local
খ often / frequently / commonly
গ neatly on a low stall / attractively in baskets / arranging them by size and color
ঘ very / fairly / quite low

Explanation:
ক: The blank requires an adjective before 'seller' to describe the vendor's style; 'itinerant' or 'mobile' indicates he moves between places, while 'local' denotes village-based.

খ: An adverb is needed to pre-modify 'seen'. 'Often', 'frequently' or 'commonly' indicate how regularly he bargains.

গ: The instruction asks for a post-modifying phrase (often a participle or descriptive phrase) that follows the verb 'arranges'. Phrases like 'neatly on a low stall', 'attractively in baskets', or 'arranging them by size and color' describe the manner of arrangement.

ঘ: This requires an intensifier before an adjective meaning 'low' or 'small'. 'Very low', 'fairly low' or 'quite low' are natural collocations showing the vendor cannot charge high prices.

ঘ using simple, everyday examples / encouraging curiosity among pupils / explaining concepts through stories and local analogies

Explanation:
ক: The blank asks for a word that pre-modifies the noun 'person' (or 'teacher'). Adjectives like 'dedicated', 'devoted' or 'respected' suitably describe a teacher's character and come before the noun.

খ: This blank requires an adverb (pre-modifying the verb 'praised'). Adverbs such as 'widely', 'generally' or 'highly' appropriately modify how the teacher is praised.

গ: The phrase 'not always a ... teacher by formal training' needs an adjective that pre-modifies 'teacher', indicating formal credentials. 'Formally qualified', 'certified' or 'trained' fit logically.

ঘ: The instruction asks for a participle phrase to post-modify the verb 'teaches'. Participial phrases beginning with '-ing' (e.g., 'using simple, everyday examples', 'encouraging curiosity among pupils', 'explaining concepts through stories and local analogies') describe the manner of teaching and correctly follow the verb.
