Question:
at stake; beyond one’s means; come round; big guns; beyond doubt; null and void; take after.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
at stake — মানে কোনো কিছুর ঝুঁকি বা লাভ-লস যা সিদ্ধান্তে নির্ভর করে; পরিস্থিতিতে যা হারানো বা জিততে পারে তাই বোঝায়, তাই এটি “ঝুঁকিতে থাকা” হিসেবে ব্যবহার করা সঠিক।  

beyond one’s means — অর্থনৈতিকভাবে সক্ষমতার বাইরে কিছু খরচ করা বা জীবনের মান বজায় রাখা; এ থেকেই বোঝা যায় কর্ম বা ক্রয় সম্ভব নয়, তাই এই অভিব্যক্তিটি “অর্থের পরিধির বাইরে” অর্থে ব্যবহার করা হয়।  

come round — সাধারণত দুটি প্রধান অর্থ থাকে: (১) জানলা/দু'সন্তোষে কাউকে দেখতে আসা (visit), (২) অসুস্থতায় চেতনায় ফেরা বা মত বদলানো; সেক্ষেত্রে প্রসঙ্গ অনুযায়ী এই অর্থগুলোই সঠিক প্রয়োগ।  

big guns — প্রতিকীকভাবে বড় ক্ষমতা বা প্রভাবশালী ব্যক্তিবর্গ বা শক্তিশালী সম্পদ বোঝায়; কারণ বাস্তবে বড় অস্ত্র বা শক্তি বিলম্বহীন প্রভাব ফেলে, তাই এটি উচ্চ ক্ষমতার জন্য ব্যবহার করা হয়।  

beyond doubt — এর মানে পুরোপুরি নিশ্চিত বা সন্দেহাতীত; কোনো বিষয়ে প্রশ্ন না থাকায় এটিকে “নিঃসন্দেহ” বলা যায়।  

null and void — আইনগত বা আনুষ্ঠানিকভাবে অকার্যকর বা শূন্য; কোনো চুক্তি বা সিদ্ধান্ত যদি বৈধতা না রাখে তখন এটি “অবৈধ/প্রযোজ্য নয়” বোঝায়।  

take after — কাউকে নাতি/বংশগতভাবে বা স্বভাবগতভাবে অনুকরণ করা বা তার মতো হওয়া (সাধারণত বাবা-মার মতো হওয়া); তাই কারো চরিত্র বা চেহারা মিললে এই পড়ে ব্যবহৃত হয়।

Question:
take one to task, slow coach, rainy day, off and on, open secret, on behalf of, bread and butter.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
take one to task — to criticize or reprimand someone for a mistake; it’s “right” because the phrase literally means bringing someone to account for their actions, so it’s used when someone is blamed or corrected.

slow coach — an informal term for a person who is slow or reluctant; the metaphor compares the person to a slow vehicle, so it’s used teasingly for slowness.

rainy day — a future time of need or difficulty (often used in “save for a rainy day”); the image of bad weather represents hard times when savings are needed.

off and on — intermittently or sporadically; it describes actions that happen sometimes but not continuously.

open secret — information that is supposed to be secret but is actually widely known; the phrase highlights the contradiction between being “open” and “secret.”

on behalf of — acting as a representative for someone or instead of them; it’s used when you speak or act for another person or group.

bread and butter — one’s main source of income or essential needs; the basic food metaphor conveys what is necessary for living or earning a livelihood.

swan song; apple of discord; blue blood; once in a blue moon; all on a sudden; learn by heart; of ones own accord.

Options:

Solution:


Explanation:
swan song — means a final performance or act before retirement or death; the phrase comes from the old belief that swans sing most beautifully just before they die, so it denotes a last notable effort.

blue blood — means noble or aristocratic birth; originally from Spanish “sangre azul,” used to distinguish royal/old noble families (paler skin showing blue veins) from commoners.  
once in a blue moon — means very rarely; a “blue moon” is an uncommon extra full moon in the calendar, so the phrase emphasizes rarity.  
all on a sudden — means very suddenly or unexpectedly; it’s an idiomatic way to indicate something happening without warning.  
learn by heart — means to memorize something thoroughly; it implies committing information to memory so you can recall it without reference.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:

"An open secret" একটি idiom যার মানে এমন তথ্য যা অনেকেরই জানা আছে কিন্তু আনুষ্ঠানিকভাবে স্বীকার করা হয় না।  
"in the mean time" সাধারণভাবে এক শব্দে লেখা হয় — "in the meantime" — এবং এটি দুটি ঘটনার মধ্যবর্তী সময়কে নির্দেশ করে।  
"In the event of" হলো শর্তসূচক رسمی 표현; কোনো ঘটনা ঘটলে কি করা হবে তা বলার জন্য ব্যবহৃত হয়।  
"As soon as" সময়গত সংযোজক হিসাবে কাজ করে এবং বোঝায় যে একটি ঘটনা অন্য ঘটার সাথেসাথে সংঘটিত হবে।  
"In front of" একটি prepositional phrase যা স্থান বা অবস্থান নির্দেশ করে, অর্থাৎ—কিছুর সামনের দিকে।  
"As though" তুলনামূলক বা অভিব্যক্তিগত ভঙ্গি প্রকাশ করে (যেন/মতো) এবং সাধারণত একটি clause অনুসরণ করে।

Question:
Win over; Let the cat out of bag; On the sly, An irony of fate, Give vent to. In a nut-shell, Of one’s own accord.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Win over — to gain someone’s support or affection; here “win” means to obtain and “over” implies changing someone’s feeling, so it correctly describes persuading or gaining favor.

Let the cat out of the bag — to reveal a secret (often accidentally); the idiom contrasts a hidden thing (in the bag) with it being exposed, so it correctly means disclosure.

On the sly — done secretly or furtively; “sly” implies stealth, so the phrase correctly denotes actions carried out without others knowing.

An irony of fate — an outcome contrary to what was expected, especially with a twist of destiny; it highlights the contrast between expectation and reality, which is the essence of ironic fate.

Give vent to — to express or release strong feelings (anger, grief, etc.); “vent” implies letting out pressure, so it correctly means expressing emotions openly.

In a nut‑shell — briefly or concisely; a nutshell is small, so the phrase correctly signals a short summary.

Of one’s own accord — voluntarily or by one’s own will, without being forced; “own accord” indicates personal choice, so it correctly means acting willingly.

Question:
of one’s own accord; as far as; for the sake of; look forward to; at the sight of; beggar description; in the long run.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
of one’s own accord — Means doing something voluntarily without being forced; context words like “volunteer,” “choose,” or “without prompting” show it’s about willing action.

as far as — Indicates extent or limit (either distance or degree) and is often followed by a clause or noun phrase that defines that limit, so it signals scope.

for the sake of — Shows purpose or motive: something is done to benefit or because of someone/something, so it introduces the reason or intended benefit.

look forward to — Means to anticipate with pleasure; it’s used with a noun or gerund (e.g., “look forward to meeting”), so the structure and positive expectation confirm this meaning.

at the sight of — Means “on seeing” or “when someone sees” and introduces an immediate reaction caused by visually noticing something, so it marks the trigger for that reaction.

beggar description — An idiom meaning something cannot adequately be described (it “beggars description”); strong or extreme qualities make ordinary words insufficient, which is why we say it’s beyond description.

in the long run — Refers to what happens eventually or over a long period; it contrasts short-term effects with the ultimate or eventual outcome.

Question:
on the sly, Pandora’s box; suitable for; in a nutshell; fast life; bid adieu; hard up.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
on the sly — "secretly": It means doing something quietly or covertly to avoid being noticed, so "secretly" captures its sense of hidden action.

Pandora’s box — "a source of unforeseen trouble": Refers to releasing many problems by one action (from the myth), so it denotes something that, once opened, causes unforeseen difficulties.

suitable for — "appropriate or fitting for": It indicates that something matches the needs, purpose, or circumstances, so "appropriate" correctly expresses that suitability.

in a nutshell — "briefly or concisely": It means giving the main point in a few words, so "briefly" captures the idea of summarizing without detail.

fast life — "life of indulgence and excitement": Refers to living quickly with pleasure-seeking, often risky behavior, so this phrase denotes a lifestyle focused on excitement and excess.

bid adieu — "say goodbye": It's a formal or poetic way to take leave, so "say goodbye" correctly expresses its meaning.

hard up — "short of money": Describes someone lacking funds or resources, so "short of money" accurately reflects its financial scarcity.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
keep body and soul together — means having just enough money or resources to survive; the phrase links "body" and "soul" figuratively to basic needs, so the correct meaning is about mere survival, not literal bodies or spirits.  
at stake — means at risk or in danger of being lost; it describes something whose outcome is uncertain, which is why it denotes jeopardy.  
black sheep — refers to a person seen as a disgrace or odd one out in a family or group; the metaphor of a rare black sheep in a flock conveys social disapproval.  
of one’s own accord — means doing something voluntarily or without being asked; the phrase emphasizes that the action came from the person’s own will.  
at all — used to emphasize negatives or to mean “in any way”; it strengthens denial or questions, so it means “to any extent.”  
learn by heart — means to memorize something thoroughly; the image of storing words in the “heart” signals complete, memorized recall.  
hue and cry — means a public outcry, alarm, or vigorous pursuit; historically it referred to raising a loud alarm and chasing a criminal, which is why it denotes loud protest or pursuit.

Question:
Good for nothing; end in smoke; bad blood: hard and fast; get rid of; catch sight of; make up one’s mind,

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
These are common idioms whose standard meanings are: "good for nothing" = useless; "end in smoke" = come to nothing/ fail; "bad blood" = hostility/ill feeling; "hard and fast" = fixed or strict; "get rid of" = remove/eliminate; "catch sight of" = see/spot; "make up one's mind" = decide. Each mapping is correct because these phrases are used idiomatically to express those ideas rather than their literal word-by-word sense, so learn them as fixed expressions in context.

Question:
Win over; Let the cat out of bag; On the sly, An irony of fate, Give vent to. In a nut-shell, Of one’s own accord.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Win over: to persuade someone to support you or feel favorably; it’s “win” because you change their attitude in your favor through argument or kindness.

Let the cat out of the bag: to reveal a secret, often unintentionally; the phrase imagines a hidden truth escaping, so a secret becomes known.

On the sly: doing something secretly or stealthily so others do not notice; “sly” implies concealment of actions.

An irony of fate: a surprising outcome where events turn out opposite to what was expected, showing fate’s unexpected twist.

Give vent to: to express strong emotions (anger, grief, joy) openly so you release or relieve those feelings.

In a nut‑shell: to state something very briefly and concisely; it signals a short summary of the main point.

Of one’s own accord: acting voluntarily without being asked or forced; it means doing something by one’s own free will.

Question:
Beggar description, a dark horse, far and wide, well off, on the sly, skim through, in not time

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
"Beggar description" — means something so extreme that words fail to describe it; the idiom "beggar (all) description" uses "beggar" to show that description is made inadequate.  
"a dark horse" — means a person or thing whose abilities or qualities are unknown and that unexpectedly succeeds; it fits because a "dark" (unknown) competitor surprises others.  
"far and wide" — means over a large area or to many places; the phrase emphasizes wide geographical or social spread.  
"well off" — means financially comfortable or prosperous; it describes someone with sufficient wealth or resources.  
"on the sly" — means secretly or without others knowing; "sly" implies stealthy or furtive behavior.  
"skim through" — means to read or look over quickly to get the main points; "skim" suggests moving lightly over the surface.  
"in not time" — is incorrect; the correct idiom is "in no time," which means very quickly or almost immediately.

Question:
take one to task, slow coach, rainy day, off and on, open secret, on behalf of, bread and butter.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
take one to task — means to reprimand or criticize someone for a fault; it’s correct because "take to task" literally means to put someone on account for their actions, so you scold them for what they did.

slow coach — means a person who is slow or sluggish; the phrase compares a person to a slow-moving coach, so it’s used to describe slow behaviour.

rainy day — means a time of hardship or emergency when saved resources are needed; the metaphor of bad weather represents difficult times when reserves are used.

off and on — means intermittently or not continuously; it describes something happening sometimes and stopping at other times.

open secret — means something officially secret but actually known to many; it’s called a "secret" in name only because it’s openly known.

on behalf of — means representing or acting for someone else; you act on their behalf when you do something for their interest or in their place.

bread and butter — means one’s main livelihood or essential needs; it uses staple food as a metaphor for the basic source of income or support.
