Explanation:
(a) "let alone" — এটি এমন এক্সপ্রেশন যা কম সম্ভব/অভাষ্য বিষয় উল্লেখ করে; "I can hardly recall his name, let alone his address" অর্থে নামই মনে নেই, ঠিকতর ঠিকানার কথাই বাদ।  
(b) "It" — সময় নির্দেশক বাক্যে অনৈতিহাসিক 'It has been many years since...' কাঠামো প্রয়োজন; এখানে অব্যয়বাচক 'It' সাবজেক্ট হিসাবে কাজ করে।  
(c) "as if" — কিছুকে ভান করে বা ধরেই ভাষ্য করার বাক্যাংশ; "Don't behave as if you knew everything" মানে এমন ভান কোরো না যেন সব কিছু জানো।

(g) "as if" — কল্পনাশীল/কতৃকথিত শর্ত প্রদর্শন করে; এখানে "As if I had a typewriter, I would type well" দ্বারা কল্পিত শর্ত বোঝানো হয় (সাধারণত 'If' ব্যবহার হয়)।  
(h) "have to" — বাধ্যতামূলক প্রয়োজন বোঝাতে; "You have to consult with a doctor" মানে ডাক্তারের পরামর্শ নেয়াটা জরুরি।  
(i) "What's he like?" — কারো স্বভাব/চরিত্র জানতে এই প্রশ্ন করা হয়; "He is friendly..." এটির সরাসরি উত্তর।

Question:
[math]\boxed{\rm{unless\qquad let~alone\qquad it\qquad there\qquad would~you~mind\qquad as~if\qquad neither~will\qquad had~better\qquad as~fast~as\qquad the~older....the ~more}}[/math]

(i) The man was seriously injured in an accident. He would have died — he had been taken to a nearby hospital.

(j) The boy talks too much of himself. He talks — he knew everything.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) the older –––– the more (b) there (c) neither will (d) as fast as (e) let alone (f) would you mind (g) it (h) had better (i) unless (j) as if

Explanation:
(a) "the older...the more" — "The older he gets, the more he looks like him." This comparative correlative shows that likeness increases with age.

(b) "there" — "There are hundreds of languages..." Use "there" (with "are") to introduce existence.

(c) "neither will" — "Neither will we." Means "we also will not," matching the negative statement.

(d) "as fast as" — "...cannot run as fast as a cheetah." The "as...as" structure compares speed (not equal).

(e) "let alone" — "...does not allow his sons to pluck any flower, let alone other children." "Let alone" emphasizes that others certainly may not do it either.

(f) "would you mind" — "Would you mind taking the box into the room?" "Would you mind + gerund" is a polite request form.

(g) "it" — "It is very difficult to get good grades in Bengali and English." "It" is the dummy subject used before an adjective + infinitive phrase.

(h) "had better" — "You had better go home right now." "Had better" gives strong advice or warning.

(i) "unless" — "He would have died unless he had been taken to a nearby hospital." "Unless" means "if not," so without being taken he would have died.

(j) "as if" — "He talks as if he knew everything." "As if" introduces a (possibly unreal) comparison or manner.

(i) Zahir Raihan — on 19 August, 1935 in Feni.

(j)We — educate all and work hard to develop our country.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "it" — "It" is the anticipatory (dummy) subject; the real subject is the infinitive clause "to fail in the exam," so "It is really unfortunate..." is correct.

(b) "let alone" — "Let alone" shows a stronger thing that is even less likely or possible, so "He cannot score a goal, let alone a hat-trick" is natural.

(c) "as soon as" — together with "possible" it makes the phrase "as soon as possible," meaning with the greatest urgency: "he needs to go home as soon as possible."

(d) "as if" — "as if" introduces how something appears or seems, so "It seems as if (the) other(s) had nothing to say" expresses appearance.

(e) "had better" — "had better + base verb" gives strong advice or warning, so "She had better understand it" is appropriate after the unhappy result.

(f) "what if" — "What if" poses a hypothetical question about a possible event: "What if you lose your pen?"

(g) "There" — in stories/description "There lived a..." is a common existential/location opener: "There lived a very clever fox in a jungle."

(h) "as long as" — expresses a condition/duration: "The poor will continue to suffer as long as they are illiterate."

(i) "was born" — the correct passive past form to give a birth date: "Zahir Raihan was born on 19 August, 1935 in Feni."

(j) "have to" — expresses necessity/obligation: "We have to educate all and work hard to develop our country."

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) had better (b) It (c) have to (d) there (e) What...... look like (f) As soon as (g) would rather (h) was born (i) let alone (j) as if

Explanation:
Explanation:

(a) We had better not go out today. — "had better" expresses strong advice/necessity and is followed by the base verb.

(b) It is a good idea to walk in the morning. — "It" is the dummy subject used with "is a good idea" to introduce a general statement.

(c) Do you often have to travel on business? — "have to" indicates necessity/requirement (Are you required to travel?).

(d) There lived a very pious man. — "There" is used to introduce the existence of someone in past narrative style ("There lived..." is a common literary pattern).

(e) What does a clown look like? — "What...look like" asks for appearance; the correct question form is "What does ... look like?"

(f) As soon as I see my father coming, my heart fills up with joy. — "As soon as" means immediately when one event happens, linking the two clauses in time.

(g) I would rather be a waiter than a barman. — "would rather" expresses preference (would prefer to be X rather than Y).

(h) Kazi Nazrul Islam was born in an impoverished family. — "was born" describes the event of birth/past passive fact.

(i) He cannot afford one meal per day, let alone square meals. — "let alone" shows that the second (more extreme) case is even less possible.

(j) Messi looked as if he were completely routed. — "as if" introduces a hypothetical/simulated situation; the subjunctive "were" is used after "as if."

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) was born (b) there (c) What's it like (d) would rather (e) has to/ had to (f) let alone (g) as soon as (h) as if (1) What if () what does ... look like

Explanation:
(a) "was born" — We use "was born" metaphorically for the creation of a country, and past tense fits "It was 45 years ago when...".

(b) "there" — "There was a great American singer..." is the correct existential construction to state someone existed/appeared during that time.

(c) "what's it like" — "What's it like living in Bangladesh?" asks about the experience of living there, matching the response "You seem to be very happy..."

(d) "would rather" — "You would rather leave this country than live here" expresses a preference (leave instead of live), so "would rather" is correct.

(e) "has to" — "Pakistan has to apologize..." expresses necessity/obligation to apologize for past atrocities.

(f) "let alone" — "We cannot expect any co-operation from them, let alone an apology" correctly contrasts a smaller expectation (co-operation) with an even less likely one (apology).

(g) "as soon as" — "came out ... as soon as the father of the nation ... was killed" shows the immediate time relationship (they emerged immediately after his killing).

(h) "as if" — "as if Bangladesh were not their own country" is the correct phrase to show behaviour that suggests a hypothetical or unreal attitude.

(i) "what if" — "What if the government of Bangladesh takes initiatives...?" poses a hypothetical question about possible government action after the university cut ties.

(j) "what does....look like" — "What does the national flower of Bangladesh look like?" asks about the appearance of the flower, so "what does...look like" fits.

(b) it — Use the impersonal subject "It" in time expressions: "It has been many years since I saw him."

(i) — is no fish here. It is a swimming pool.

(j) I went there to meet with him. — I saw him, I rushed to talk to him.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "let alone" — ব্যবহার করে দুটি বস্তু বা কাজের মধ্যে বৃদ্ধি বা আরো কঠিন/অসম্ভবতার তুলনা করা হয়; সে বাইসাইকেলও কিনতে পারে না, পাহাড়ের মতো মটরসাইকেল তো আর নয় — hence "let alone" fits.

(b) "what's it like" — এই প্রশ্নটি কোন অভিজ্ঞতা বা অভিভাব্যতা জানতে ব্যবহার হয়; "I’ve never travelled by air, what’s it like in the sky?" অর্থাৎ আকাশে কেমন লাগে জানতে চাওয়া হয়েছে.

(c) "It" — here "It is not worth waiting any longer." এ ক্ষেত্রে "it" হলো dummy subject যা সাধারণ বিবৃতির শুরুতে লাগে; তাই "it" প্রয়োজন।

(d) "would rather" — পছন্দ প্রকাশ করতে ব্যবহার হয়: "I would rather stay at home than go outside." দুটি বিকল্পের মধ্যে প্রত্যাশিত পছন্দ দেখায়।

(e) "had better" — তাৎপর্যপূর্ণ, শক্ত পরামর্শ বা সতর্কতা বোঝায়: "You had better take rest." না করলে খারাপ ফল হতে পারে এমন পরামর্শে এটি ব্যবহৃত হয়।

(f) "as if" — তুলনা বা অনুকরণসূচক বাগদান যেখানে বাস্তবে না-ও হতে পারে; "He speaks as if he knew the ins and outs" মানে সে এমন ভাবে কথা বলে যেন সে সব জানে (অবশ্য তা সত্য না-ও হতে পারে)।

(g) "have to" — বাধ্যতামূলক কাজ বোঝায়; বর্তমান সময়ে Person-এ অনুযায়ী বলা হলে "He has to go back to the hospital for a scan next week." অর্থাৎ তার স্ক্যানের জন্য ফিরে যেতে হবে।

(h) "was born" — জন্মের ক্রিয়া passiveভাবে প্রকাশ করতে ব্যবহৃত হয়: "Tagore was born in 1861." জন্মসাল জানাতে এই বাক্যগঠন প্রযোজ্য।

(i) "There" — অস্তিত্ব প্রকাশের বাক্যে "There is/are" ব্যবহার হয়: "There is no fish here." বলে বোঝায় এখানে কোনো মাছ নেই।

(j) "as soon as" — কোন কাজ ঘটে মাত্র ঠিক পরেই অন্য কাজ শুরু হলে ব্যবহৃত হয়: "As soon as I saw him, I rushed to talk to him." অর্থাৎ দেখার সঙ্গে সঙ্গেই তৎক্ষণাৎ এগোনো।

(j) A good citizen — perform a lot of things. These things will enable him to become a true patriot.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
a "Was born" is correct because it denotes a past passive event of birth (Shamsur Rahman was born in Dhaka in 1929).

b "No sooner had" is used with inversion and "than" to show one action immediately followed another: "No sooner had Diamond jumped... than the candle fell."

c "Had better" gives strong advice or recommendation: "You had better apply to the Principal."

d "Used to" indicates a habitual action in the past — Edison repeatedly did such activities in childhood.

e "What's the matter" is the natural question a mother asks to learn the cause of distress ("What's the matter with you?").

f "But for" expresses the conditional cause whose absence would have led to the bad result: "But for your timely intervention, I would have been assaulted."

g "What do you mean?" expresses disbelief or asks for clarification of a surprising statement like "How can a rope bite a man?"

h "As if" shows a comparison or pretence — he speaks as if he knew it, though he actually does not.

i "It" is the dummy/anticipatory subject used in impersonal statements: "It is a good idea to walk in the morning."

j "Has to" indicates obligation or necessity that a good citizen must perform certain duties.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: What if

গ Answer: as soon as

ঘ Answer: let alone

Explanation:
ক: 'What if' introduces a hypothetical negative outcome used when considering possibilities: 'What if we miss the last train?' খ: 'Would rather' expresses preference: 'I would rather eat at home tonight.' গ: 'As soon as' indicates immediate succession: 'He walked into the room as soon as every eye turned to him' (or better: 'as soon as he entered, every eye turned to him'). Used here to link the two quick events. ঘ: 'Let alone' stresses that something even less likely or possible applies: 'She can't afford a new phone, let alone a tablet.'

খ. She — play outside every afternoon, — stay indoors watching TV.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: was born; when

খ Answer: used to; rather than

গ Answer: In case

ঘ Answer: as though

Explanation:
ক: 'was born' states birthplace; 'when' connects hearing the sea to feeling calm: 'Tania was born in a small coastal town and when she heard the sea she felt calm.' খ: 'used to' indicates a habitual past action; 'rather than' contrasts staying indoors: 'She used to play outside every afternoon, rather than stay indoors watching TV.' গ: 'In case' is used to prepare for a possible event: 'In case it starts to rain, she takes an umbrella.' ঘ: 'as though' describes an attitude or appearance suggesting something untrue: 'He spoke to her as though she were uninterested.'

(context asks about countryside or city). খ: 'had better' is appropriate for giving urgent advice in a bad situation: 'You had better call your manager.' গ: 'as if' is used to describe someone's manner that implies something untrue — 'he speaks as if he knows everything.' ঘ: 'let alone' is used to emphasize impossibility by adding a stronger item: 'They can't afford a car, let alone buy a scooter.'

Fill each sentence below with the most appropriate phrase from the list.

Options:
ক. He promised to come — he had no urgent work.
খ. She looked — she had seen a ghost.
গ. The team won the match — missing their star player.
ঘ. — the sun set, they had already reached home.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: provided that

খ Answer: as if

গ Answer: despite

ঘ Answer: by the time

Explanation:
ক (provided that): 'Provided that' means 'only if' or 'on the condition that'. The sentence 'He promised to come — he had no urgent work.' implies a condition for his coming, so 'provided that' fits: 'He promised to come provided that he had no urgent work.'

খ (as if): 'As if' introduces a clause that describes appearance or manner, often imaginary. 'She looked — she had seen a ghost.' means her expression suggested she had seen a ghost: 'She looked as if she had seen a ghost.'

গ (despite): 'Despite' expresses contrast in spite of something. The team winning even though they lacked a key player is 'The team won the match despite missing their star player.'

ঘ (by the time): 'By the time' refers to a point when something has already happened. '— the sun set, they had already reached home.' becomes 'By the time the sun set, they had already reached home.' This shows their arrival occurred before sunset.

Options:
ক. You — bring an umbrella; it's going to rain.

গ. Call me — you arrive.
ঘ. We will help you — you ask.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: had better

খ Answer: let alone

গ Answer: as soon as

ঘ Answer: as long as

Explanation:
ক (had better): 'Had better' is used to give strong advice or warning. 'You had better bring an umbrella; it's going to rain.' is natural and warns about likely rain.

খ (let alone): 'Let alone' is used to emphasize that if the first thing is not true or possible, a stronger related thing is even less likely. 'He can't boil an egg, let alone cook a full meal.' shows cooking a meal is even less likely.

গ (as soon as): 'As soon as' indicates immediacy: do X immediately after Y occurs. 'Call me as soon as you arrive.' asks to call immediately upon arrival.

ঘ (as long as): 'As long as' expresses a condition: provided that. 'We will help you as long as you ask.' means help will be given on the condition that you ask for it.

গ (among): 'Among' is used with things that are part of a group or within a mass. 'The keys were hidden among the pages of the old book.' is natural (hidden within/among the pages).

ঘ (across): 'Across' indicates movement or span from one side to the other. 'The bridge stretches across the river.' correctly describes the bridge spanning the river.

Options:
ক. — the warnings, she climbed the cliff and fell.
খ. — I reached the station when the train departed.
গ. — called him? He seems nervous and secretive.
ঘ. — your timely help, we would have failed the project.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: "In spite of the warnings, she climbed the cliff and fell." 

খ Answer: "Barely had I reached the station when the train departed." 

গ Answer: "Who on earth called him? He seems nervous and secretive." 

ঘ Answer: "If not for your timely help, we would have failed the project."

Explanation:
ক: 'In spite of' means 'despite' and introduces a contrast: although there were warnings, she climbed and fell.

খ: 'Barely had ... when/than' (or 'Hardly had ... when') is another inversion structure used to describe two closely timed events. The correct inversion is 'Barely had I reached the station when the train departed.'

গ: 'Who on earth' is a colloquial emphatic way to ask about identity (adds surprise or irritation). It emphasizes the speaker's curiosity or disbelief about who made the call.

ঘ: 'If not for' introduces a conditional clause meaning 'without' or 'had it not been for.' 'If not for your timely help, we would have failed' correctly expresses that the help prevented failure.

Type: CQ | Book: English 2nd Paper | Years:  | Boards:  | Tags: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
Fill each blank with the most appropriate phrase from the box to complete the sentences naturally:
[had better, as though, would rather, let alone, as soon as, had to, look like, was born]

Context: Short everyday situations where a single idiomatic phrase best completes each sentence.

Options:
ক. The thunderstorm warning is serious; we _____ cancel the outdoor concert tonight.
খ. When he entered the room he smiled _____ he owned the company.
গ. Given her busy schedule, she _____ spend the evening reading a paperback _____ watching a long film.
ঘ. Rafi can't afford one good meal a day, _____ three square meals.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক had better

খ as though

গ would rather

ঘ let alone

Explanation:
ক (had better): 'Had better' is used to give strong advice or a warning about a likely bad outcome. Here cancelling the concert is strong advice because of the storm. 

খ (as though): 'As though' (or 'as if') introduces a comparison that describes how someone appears or behaves. 'He smiled as though he owned the company' means his manner suggested ownership or extreme confidence. 

গ (would rather): 'Would rather' expresses preference; the structure is 'would rather + verb + than + verb'. The sentence implies she prefers reading to watching a long film. Depending on style, you could also write 'would rather spend the evening reading a paperback than watching a long film.' 

ঘ (let alone): 'Let alone' shows an even more impossible or unlikely case. 'He can't afford one good meal a day, let alone three square meals' emphasizes the greater impossibility of affording three meals. The phrase connects two negatives to stress contrast.

Question:
Choose the best phrase from the list to complete each workplace-related sentence naturally:
[as soon as, had to, had better, as if, look like, would rather, let alone, was born]

Context: Short statements about work habits, impressions, and necessities.

Options:
ক. You _____ finish the report before the meeting; the manager expects it on his desk.
খ. She answered the interviewer's questions calmly, _____ she had practiced them many times.
গ. After his father lost his job, Amin _____ contribute to the household income while still at school.
ঘ. Tom couldn't handle a half-day workshop, _____ a full-week training course.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক had better

খ as if

গ had to

ঘ let alone

Explanation:
ক (had better): 'Had better' is used to advise or warn about a necessary action with possible negative consequences if ignored — here, finishing the report is the urgent recommendation. 

খ (as if): 'As if' describes appearance or behaviour that suggests something (often unreal). 'She answered... as if she had practiced' means her manner made it seem she had rehearsed. 

গ (had to): 'Had to' indicates past obligation or necessity. Because of family circumstances, Amin was compelled to help earn money. 

ঘ (let alone): Used to intensify a negative statement by adding a more extreme example; if Tom cannot manage a half-day workshop, expecting him to do a full-week course is even less likely.

Question:
Complete each everyday-life sentence using the most fitting phrase from the given list:
[as soon as, would rather, look like, was born, had better, as though, had to, let alone]

Context: Short descriptive sentences about reactions, preferences, beginnings, and comparisons.

Options:

খ. The baby _____ on a cold winter night; his parents wrapped him immediately in warm clothes.
গ. I _____ drink tea in the morning than start the day with no caffeine at all.
ঘ. From the photo he doesn't _____ a professional model; he's more casual than that.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক as though

খ was born

গ would rather

ঘ look like

Explanation:
ক (as though): 'As though' expresses the speaker's impression or imagined comparison. 'I smile as though I'm talking to an old friend' conveys that his voice creates that friendly feeling. 

খ (was born): 'Was born' is the standard passive expression for birth. 'The baby was born on a cold winter night' describes the time of birth. 

গ (would rather): 'Would rather' expresses preference (I prefer X to Y). 'I would rather drink tea in the morning than start the day with no caffeine' shows the speaker's choice. 

ঘ (look like): 'Look like' describes appearance or the impression given by someone's photo. 'He doesn't look like a professional model' means his appearance seems more casual than model-like.

Question:
You are organizing a small office meeting and need to complete instructions, requests and observations with the correct linking words or phrases so that each sentence sounds natural and grammatically correct.

Options:
ক. There is loud music in the corridor. — you turn it down?
খ. I'll bring extra chairs — more people arrive.
গ. All staff — follow the new security procedures from Monday.
ঘ. He described the event — he had witnessed nothing himself.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Would you mind
খ in case
গ have to
ঘ as though

Explanation:
ক (Would you mind): This is a polite request structure. "Would you mind you turn it down?" is ungrammatical; the proper full form is "Would you mind turning it down?" but the short prompt uses the phrase "Would you mind" to fit naturally as a polite request to reduce the music.  

খ (in case): "In case" is used to prepare for a possible future event. Bringing extra chairs "in case more people arrive" shows a precautionary action.  

গ (have to): "Have to" expresses obligation or requirement. "All staff have to follow the new security procedures" states a mandatory rule starting Monday.  

ঘ (as though): "As though" (or "as if") is used to describe behaviour that suggests something is true but may not be. "He described the event as though he had witnessed it" means his description gave the impression he saw it, even if he didn't.

Question:
Short travel and household scenarios—choose the best conjunction or phrase to complete each sentence so the intended meaning (condition, sequence, warning, urgency) is clear.

Options:
ক. We won't start the picnic — it stops raining.
খ. She had finished packing. — the taxi arrived.
গ. Fasten the gate — the goats escape.
ঘ. It — you to visit a doctor; your symptoms have lasted weeks.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক unless
খ No sooner had she finished packing than
গ lest
ঘ is high time

Explanation:
ক (unless): "Unless" introduces the only condition under which the action will not happen. "We won't start the picnic unless it stops raining" means the picnic will not begin if it continues to rain.  

খ (No sooner had ... than): This paired structure expresses immediate sequence: "No sooner had she finished packing than the taxi arrived" means the taxi arrived immediately after she finished. The auxiliary "had" + past participle is used in the inversion form for emphasis.  

গ (lest): "Lest" expresses purpose with a negative outcome: "Fasten the gate lest the goats escape" means fasten the gate to prevent that unwanted result. It is somewhat formal/literary but fits here.  

ঘ (is high time): "It is high time" + past tense means something should already have been done. "It is high time you visited a doctor" (or "It is high time you saw a doctor") conveys urgency and that the action was overdue.

Question:
Classroom and preference contexts: insert the most suitable connective or phrase to make each sentence precise and natural.

Options:
ক. Students may use the laboratory — they follow all safety rules.
খ. He laughed — he had received disappointing news.
গ. She cycles to work — driving.
ঘ. You may borrow my notes — you return them after the exam.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক provided that
খ as though
গ rather than
ঘ as long as

Explanation:
ক (provided that): "Provided that" introduces a condition that must be met. "Students may use the laboratory provided that they follow all safety rules" means permission depends on obeying safety requirements.  

খ (as though): "As though" (or "as if") indicates appearance or manner suggesting something that may not be true. "He laughed as though he had received disappointing news" suggests his laugh gave that (perhaps misleading) impression.  

গ (rather than): "Rather than" expresses preference or choice between two actions. "She cycles to work rather than driving" shows she prefers cycling over driving.  

ঘ (as long as): "As long as" indicates a condition that must be satisfied for permission to hold. "You may borrow my notes as long as you return them after the exam" means borrowing is allowed on the condition of returning them afterward.

খ Answer: no matter how
গ Answer: as soon as

গ (as soon as): 'I'll phone you as soon as I get home.' 'As soon as' indicates that one action will follow immediately after another.

ঘ (so...that): 'The earthquake was so strong that people ran into the streets in panic.' 'So...that' expresses a cause-effect relationship where the intensity (so strong) produced the result (people ran into the streets).

গ (as long as): 'I will lend you the book as long as you promise to return it next week.' 'As long as' sets a condition that must be met for the action to occur.

ঘ (for fear that): 'He whispered the password for fear that anyone overheard it.' 'For fear that' indicates doing something to prevent an undesirable possibility (someone overhearing the password). Note: grammatically one may also say 'for fear that anyone might overhear it.'

গ (rather than): 'I prefer to walk rather than take the bus for such a short distance.' 'Rather than' presents a preference between two alternatives.

ঘ (in case): 'Take a torch with you in case you find your way in the dark.' 'In case' expresses a precaution against a possible future situation. The sentence warns to bring a torch to guard against the possibility of darkness.
