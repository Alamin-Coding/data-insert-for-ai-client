Question:
(a) My father is a teacher who——–.

(b) Unless he gets up early in the morning——–.

(c) It is high time we——–.

(d) Though it is raining———.

(e) A patriot is respected——–.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:

(a) My father is a teacher who teaches English.
- This uses a relative clause with "who" to give more information about "father"; present simple "teaches" describes his habitual job.

(b) Unless he gets up early in the morning, he will miss the bus.
- "Unless" means "if not"; the conditional uses present tense in the unless-clause and "will" in the main clause to show the future consequence.

(c) It is high time we started our work.
- After "It is high time" English uses a past-tense form to express that an action is overdue or should already be done.

(d) Though it is raining, we will go out.
- "Though" introduces a contrast; the concessive clause (present progressive) doesn’t prevent the main clause (future action) from happening.

(e) A patriot is respected by his countrymen.
- This is passive voice: "is respected" shows the subject receives the action, and "by his countrymen" names the agents who respect him.

Question:
(a) No sooner had he reached the station———.

(b) She ran fast lest——–.

(c) He could not avail———.

(d) I prevented him———.

(e) All should do something to———-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) No sooner had he reached the station than the train left.  
Explanation: "No sooner ... than" is a fixed correlative; after "no sooner" we use inversion (had he) and connect the second event with "than."

(b) She ran fast lest she should miss the bus.  
Explanation: "Lest" expresses negative purpose and is followed by "should" or the subjunctive ("lest she miss the bus") meaning "to avoid missing."

(c) He could not avail himself of the opportunity.  
Explanation: "Avail" is used reflexively as "avail oneself of" meaning to make use of something, so it needs "himself of + noun."

(d) I prevented him from entering.  
Explanation: "Prevent" is followed by "from + -ing" to show stopping someone from doing something (e.g., "prevented him from entering the room").

(e) All should do something to help others.  
Explanation: "Do something to + infinitive" shows purpose; this sentence says everyone has a responsibility to act to help.

Question:
(a) We want that ———.

(b) Man dies but————-.

(c) People work with a view to————-.

(d) I wish————-.

(e) A patriot is person whom————-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) We want that he should succeed.
Explanation: This is a noun clause after "want" expressing our desire; "should succeed" (or the subjunctive "succeed") states what we wish. (More natural everyday English is "We want him to succeed.")

(b) Man dies but his name lives on.
Explanation: This contrast shows that a person's physical life ends but their reputation or memory can continue; "lives on" is an idiom meaning to be remembered.

(c) People work with a view to earning money.
Explanation: After "with a view to" we use a gerund (‑ing form); it indicates purpose or intention — here the purpose is "earning money."

(d) I wish I were rich.
Explanation: "I wish" + past-subjunctive (were) expresses an unreal or contrary-to-fact present wish; "were" is used for hypothetical situations.

(e) A patriot is a person who loves his country.
Explanation: "Who" introduces a relative clause describing "person" and acts as the subject of "loves"; the clause defines what a patriot is.

Question:
(a) I wish ———.

(b) He works hard so that———-

(c) There is hardly any person———-.

(d) Man is born free but———-.

(e) It is our sacred duty——-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) I wish I were rich.
Explanation: "I wish" expresses a present unreal desire, so English uses the past subjunctive "were" to show the situation is contrary to reality.

(b) He works hard so that he may succeed.
Explanation: "so that" introduces a purpose clause; using a modal like "may" (or "might") after it shows the intended result or purpose of his hard work.

(c) There is hardly any person who does not like praise.
Explanation: "hardly any person" needs a relative clause beginning with "who"; the negative "does not" fits because the sense is "almost no one fails to like praise."

(d) Man is born free but everywhere he is in chains.
Explanation: This contrast uses "but" to show opposition; the clause "everywhere he is in chains" completes the famous idea that social conditions restrict natural freedom.

(e) It is our sacred duty to protect the environment.
Explanation: After the noun "duty" we use the to-infinitive ("to protect") to state the action required or expected of us.

Question:
(a) My father is a teacher who——–.

(b) Unless he gets up early in the morning——–.

(c) It is high time we——–.

(d) Though it is raining———.

(e) A patriot is respected——–.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:

ক "My father is a teacher who teaches at the local school." — Here "who" is a relative pronoun referring to "father", so the clause needs a verb agreeing with that singular subject to give extra information.

খ "Unless he gets up early in the morning, he will miss the bus." — "Unless" means "if not", so a present simple in the if-clause leads naturally to a future result in the main clause.

গ "It is high time we started studying." — After "it is high time" English uses a past-tense form to express that something should already be happening (a present obligation).

ঘ "Though it is raining, we will go out." — "Though" introduces a concessive idea; the main clause contrasts with or happens despite the subordinate clause.

ঙ "A patriot is respected by his countrymen." — This is passive voice: the patriot (subject) receives the action "is respected," and "by his countrymen" names the agent.

Question:
(a) Walk fast lest_____.

(b) It is high time_____.

(c) Modem husbands are______.

(d) For good health_____.

(e) If I help him in danger_____.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
a Walk fast lest you be late. Lest means “for fear that” and takes the subjunctive (here “be”), showing prevention of being late.

b It is high time you went to bed. “It is high time” is followed by a past-tense form to express that something should happen now.

c Modern husbands are more understanding. After “are” we use an adjective or adjective phrase; “more understanding” compares their attitude.

d For good health you should eat a balanced diet. “For good health” gives the purpose or recommendation, so a modal like “should” or an imperative follows.

e If I help him in danger, he will be saved. This is a first conditional: present tense in the if-clause and “will” + base verb in the main clause to show a likely result.

(b) This poem is too difficult for———-.

(c) No sooner had she seen me———–.

(d) He speaks as if——-----.

(e) It is high time we———-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:

(a) They went to college after they had finished school.
- The past perfect [math]("had finished")[/math] shows the finishing of school happened before the later past action (went to college).

(b) This poem is too difficult for me to understand.
- The pattern "too ... for ... to" requires "for + object + to-infinitive" to show inability.

(c) No sooner had she seen me than she ran away.
- "No sooner ... than" uses past perfect in the first clause and simple past in the second to show one past event immediately followed another.

(d) He speaks as if he knew everything.
- "As if" with a past (subjunctive) form "knew" expresses an unreal or hypothetical present situation.

(e) It is high time we left.
- "It is high time" takes a past verb to indicate that the action is overdue or should happen now.

Question:
(a) It is easy to say but–—----.

(b) Five years passed since ——---- .

(c) A graveyard is a place —----.

(d) She insisted that—–-----.

(e) Unless you work hard,———-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
a Answer: "harder to do." This is an idiomatic contrast: "easy to say but harder to do" uses the comparative "harder" to show that saying is easier than actually doing.

b Answer: "we met" (full sentence: "Five years have passed since we met"). "Since" names a point in the past, so we normally use present perfect ("have passed") to show time elapsed up to now.

c Answer: "where the dead are buried." "Place" is followed by a relative clause introduced by "where" to describe that location.

d Answer: "he apologize" (full sentence: "She insisted that he apologize."). After "insisted that" English often uses the subjunctive (base verb form) to report a demand or insistence; you can also say "insisted that he should apologize" in less formal use.

e Answer: "you will fail." "Unless" means "if not," so "Unless you work hard, you will fail" shows the future result if the condition is not met.

Question:
(a) I don’t like people who_____.

(b) Do you know where______.

(c) It was long since_____.

(d) You will not prosper unless_____.

(e) Had I been proposed to go______.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) I don't like people who lie.
Explanation: "who" introduces a relative clause describing "people"; use the base verb (present simple) to state a habitual or general trait.

(b) Do you know where he lives?
Explanation: In an indirect question the subject comes before the verb (he lives), not the auxiliary form (Does he live).

(c) It was long since I had seen him.
Explanation: When referring to an action that happened before a past time, use the past perfect after "since" (or more commonly say "It has been a long time since I saw him" for present reference).

(d) You will not prosper unless you work hard.
Explanation: "Unless" means "if not," so use the present simple after "unless" to state the condition for a future result.

(e) Had I been asked to go, I would have gone.
Explanation: This is the inverted third conditional (Had I been asked... = If I had been asked...), so the result clause uses "would have" + past participle.

(b) Although Bangladesh is a populous country, it———-.

(c) He is my teacher who———-.

(d) I wish I———-.

(e) He took up a part-time job so that———.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) As you sow, so shall you reap. ব্যাখ্যা: এটি একটি প্রবাদবাক্য; "as" অংশটি কারণ/অবস্থাকে দেখায় এবং "so shall you reap" ফলে বা পরিণতির ইনভার্শন করে।

(b) Although Bangladesh is a populous country, it is small in area. ব্যাখ্যা: "Although" দুটি বিপরীত ধারণাকে যুক্ত করে — জনসংখ্যা বেশি হলেও ভৌগোলিক আয়তন ছোট, তাই তর্কগত বিরোধপূর্ণ তথ্য দেয়ার জন্য এভাবে শেষ করা হয়।

(c) He is my teacher who teaches me English. ব্যাখ্যা: "who" দ্বারা নির্দেশক সম্পর্কবাচক ক্লজ দেওয়া হয়েছে যা শিক্ষক সম্পর্কে অতিরিক্ত তথ্য দেয়; সাধারণ অভ্যাস বোঝাতে present simple ব্যবহার করা হয় ("teaches")।

(d) I wish I were rich. ব্যাখ্যা: বর্তমান অসম্ভব বা কল্পিত ইচ্ছা প্রকাশ করতে "wish" এর সাথে past subjunctive ("were") ব্যবহার করা হয়।

(e) He took up a part-time job so that he could support himself. ব্যাখ্যা: "so that" উদ্দেশ্য দেখায়; অতীত কাল পরিস্থিতিতে সক্ষমতা বা উদ্দেশ্য বাস্তবায়নের জন্য "could" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।

(b) This poem is too difficult for———-.

(c) No sooner had she seen me———–.

(d) He speaks as if——-----.

(e) It is high time we———-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) They went to college after they graduated.
Explanation: "After" shows sequence of past events, so the past simple "graduated" indicates the earlier completed action before going to college.

(b) This poem is too difficult for me to understand.
Explanation: The pattern "too + adjective + for + someone + to + verb" shows that the poem’s difficulty prevents the person from understanding it.

(c) No sooner had she seen me than she ran away.
Explanation: "No sooner" requires inversion (had she seen) and is paired with "than" to show one past action immediately followed another.

(d) He speaks as if he knew everything.
Explanation: "As if" with the past form (knew) expresses an unreal or hypothetical present idea—he behaves like he knows everything, though he probably does not.

(e) It is high time we left.
Explanation: "It is high time" uses the past simple (left) to indicate that the action should be done now or very soon.

(b) Five years passed since ——---- .

(c) A graveyard is a place —----.

(d) She insisted that—–-----.

(e) Unless you work hard,———-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) It is easy to say but hard to do.
Explanation: This is an idiomatic contrast—"easy to say" vs "hard to do." The phrase uses an adjective phrase ("hard to do") to complete the contrast.

(b) Five years have passed since then.
Explanation: "Since" needs a point in time (here "then"); the present perfect ("have passed") is normally used to show time from that point until now.

(c) A graveyard is a place where dead people are buried.
Explanation: "Where" introduces a relative clause describing location; the clause explains the purpose or use of the place.

(d) She insisted that he apologize.
Explanation: After "insist that" English often uses a subjunctive (base verb) or "should" + infinitive; here the subjunctive "apologize" correctly completes the demand.

(e) Unless you work hard, you will fail.
Explanation: "Unless" means "if not," so it pairs a present-tense condition with a future consequence ("will fail").

(a) I am so tired that _____.

(b) It is high time we ——--- the place.

(c) Though it was quite dark —--—.

(d) He learns much so that_____.

(e) If the weather is good_____.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "I am so tired that I can hardly keep my eyes open."
Explanation: The "so... that" structure shows a result; use a present ability verb ("can hardly") to state the immediate result of being tired.

(b) "It is high time we left the place."
Explanation: "It is high time" takes a past-tense verb to express that something should happen now, so the past simple "left" conveys present necessity.

(c) "Though it was quite dark, we managed to find our way."
Explanation: "Though" introduces a contrast; the main clause shows the unexpected result, so a past-tense result ("managed to find our way") fits the past context.

(d) "He learns much so that he can pass his exams."
Explanation: "So that" expresses purpose and commonly uses a modal (can/may) in the result clause to show ability or intention.

(e) "If the weather is good, we will go for a picnic."
Explanation: This is a first conditional: present simple in the "if" clause and "will" in the main clause to state a possible future result.

(c) There goes the proverb that —.

(d) It was long since —.

(e) Do what —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
ক "Read attentively or you'll miss the point." — এখানে "or" পরিণতি বোঝায়, তাই ভবিষ্যৎ সময় ব্যবহার করে [math]you'll\ miss\ the\ point[/math] (you will miss the point) বলা উচিত। 

খ "Had I been there, I would have helped you." — এটি তৃতীয় ধরণের শর্তবাচক বাক্যের বিপরীতাকারে লেখা (inversion): "Had I been..." = "If I had been...", ফলস্বরুপ "would have helped" লাগে। 

গ "There goes the proverb that 'actions speak louder than words'." — "There goes" দিয়ে এমন একটি প্রবাদ বা বাক্যাংশ পরিচিতি করানো হয় যা ঘটনার উপযুক্ত প্রয়োগ দেখায়; প্রবাদটি বাক্যটি সম্পূর্ণ করে। 

ঘ "It was long since I had seen him." — "It was long since" এর পরে অতীত-পূর্ণকাল (past perfect) ব্যবহার করে একটি দীর্ঘ বিরতির কথা বলা হয়, যেমন "I had seen him"। 

ঙ "Do what you like." — এখানে "what" একটি free relative clause তৈরি করে (যা-ই তুমি পছন্দ করো), এবং আদেশবাচক "Do" এর বস্তু হিসেবে কাজ করে।

(d) I would rather suffer ——.

(e) Scarcely had I reached the college ——.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) He is tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Explanation: After "enough" with an adjective, use a "to‑infinitive" to show what someone can do because of that quality.

(b) Saturday is the day when we can relax.
Explanation: "When" introduces a time clause referring to "the day," so use "when" + clause to say what happens on that day.

(c) It is time for you to leave.
Explanation: Use "time for + person + to‑infinitive" to indicate that a person should now do something.

(d) I would rather suffer than beg.
Explanation: "Would rather ... than ..." contrasts two actions; the verbs after both parts are in the base form.

(e) Scarcely had I reached the college when it began to rain.
Explanation: After negative/time adverbials like "scarcely," invert subject and auxiliary ("had I"); use "when" to introduce the event that followed.

Question:
(a) Hardly had he reached the station_____.

(b) He speaks as if_____.

(c) I went to Dhaka with a view to_____.

(d) He walked carefully lest_____.

(e) We wish_____.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Hardly had he reached the station when the train left.  
This shows two past actions where one immediately followed the other; English uses inversion with "Hardly had..." and then "when" + simple past for the second action.

(b) He speaks as if he were an expert.  
"As if" takes the past subjunctive ("were") to show an unreal or hypothetical present situation.

(c) I went to Dhaka with a view to meeting him.  
"With a view to" is followed by a noun or gerund, so use "meeting" (not the infinitive).

(d) He walked carefully lest he should fall.  
"Lest" expresses negative purpose and is followed by "should" or the subjunctive ("fall") to mean "in order to avoid his falling."

(e) We wish we were rich.  
"Wish" + past subjunctive ("were") expresses a present desire or regret about something unreal now.

Question:
(a) I don’t like people who_____.

(b) Do you know where______.

(c) It was long since_____.

(d) You will not prosper unless_____.

(e) Had I been proposed to go______.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:

(a) I don’t like people who lie.
- "Who" is a relative pronoun referring to people and is followed by a verb; "lie" completes the relative clause describing those people.

(b) Do you know where he lives?
- In an embedded question the statement word order is used (subject before verb), so "where he lives" is correct, not "where lives he."

(c) It was long since I saw him.
- "Since" refers to a past time, so a past tense verb ("saw") is used to show that a long time has passed since that event.

(d) You will not prosper unless you work hard.
- "Unless" means "if not," so the clause uses the present simple ("you work hard") to state the condition for future success.

(e) Had I been proposed to go there.
- "Proposed to go" is completed by an adverb like "there"; note that "Had I been..." is a past hypothetical inversion and typically needs a result clause (e.g., "Had I been proposed to go there, I would have accepted").

(c) Modem husbands are______.

(d) For good health_____.

(e) If I help him in danger_____.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Walk fast lest you be late.
Explanation: "Lest" introduces a negative purpose ("in order to prevent") and is followed by a subjunctive-like form; "you be late" shows what to avoid.

(b) It is high time you went to bed.
Explanation: "It is high time" expresses that something should happen now and is followed by a past-tense form to convey a present or overdue necessity (acts like a subjunctive).

(c) Modern husbands are more considerate.
Explanation: This is a general statement using a comparative ("more") to describe a typical quality; "considerate" fits as a common positive trait.

(d) For good health, exercise regularly.
Explanation: "For good health" gives the reason or purpose, and the imperative "exercise regularly" is a direct recommendation to achieve that purpose.

(e) If I help him in danger, he will be grateful.
Explanation: This is a first conditional: "If" + present simple ("help") in the condition and "will" + base verb ("will be grateful") in the result to show a likely future outcome.

(c) He could not avail———.

(d) I prevented him———.

(e) All should do something to———-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) No sooner had he reached the station than the train left.  
Explanation: "No sooner ... than" is the correct correlative to show one action immediately followed another, with past perfect in the first clause.

(b) She ran fast lest she should miss the bus.  
Explanation: "Lest" expresses fear of something happening and is followed by the subjunctive ("should" + base) or bare infinitive to show negative purpose.

(c) He could not avail himself of the opportunity.  
Explanation: "Avail" requires the reflexive "avail oneself of" to mean "make use of," so add "himself of" and the object.

(d) I prevented him from leaving.  
Explanation: "Prevent" is followed by "from" + verb-ing to show stopping someone from doing something.

(e) All should do something to help.  
Explanation: "Do something to" + base verb expresses purpose; here "help" completes the idea simply and correctly.

(c) People work with a view to————-.

(d) I wish————-.

(e) A patriot is person whom————-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) We want him to succeed.
Explanation: After "want" the normal structure is object + infinitive ("him to succeed"), not a plain "that" clause; this expresses our desire for his success.

(b) Man dies but his name lives on.
Explanation: This is an idiomatic way to say a person's fame or reputation can continue after death; "lives on" shows continuation despite death.

(c) People work with a view to earning a living.
Explanation: In the phrase "with a view to," the word "to" is a preposition, so it must be followed by a noun or gerund ("earning"), not an infinitive.

(d) I wish I were rich.
Explanation: "Wish" for an unreal or contrary-to-fact present situation uses the past subjunctive ("were") to show that the speaker is not actually rich.

(e) A patriot is a person who loves his country.
Explanation: "Who" is used because it is the subject of the relative clause ("who loves"); "whom" would be incorrect here because it is the object form.

Question:
(a) I wish ———.

(b) He works hard so that———-

(c) There is hardly any person———-.

(d) Man is born free but———-.

(e) It is our sacred duty——-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
ক I wish I were rich. — এখানে "wish" + past subjunctive ("were") ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে কারণ লেখক বর্তমান পরিস্থিতির বিপরীতে কোনো কল্পিত অবস্থা বোঝাচ্ছে (বর্তমানে ধনী নয়)।  

খ He works hard so that he may succeed. — "so that" উদ্দেশ্যবোধক কনজাংকশন; এর পরে ফল বা উদ্দেশ্য দেখাতে modal ("may"/"can") বা infinitive আসে।  

গ There is hardly any person who does not need help. — "hardly any" মানে প্রায় কেউ না; বাক্যটি পূর্ণ করতে relative clause ("who does not need help") লাগে যা সাধারণ সত্য বোঝায়।  

ঘ Man is born free, but everywhere he is in chains. — "but" দুটি বিপরীত ভাবের মধ্যে বিরোধ দেখায়: জন্মগত স্বাধীনতা বনাম বাস্তব জীবনের বাঁধা।  

ঙ It is our sacred duty to serve our country. — "It is ... duty" কাঠামোতে কাজ বা কর্তব্য বোঝাতে infinitive ("to serve") ব্যবহৃত হয়, যা দায়িত্বের উদ্দেশ্য প্রকাশ করে।

Question:
(a) The weather is so cold that———.

(b) He was strong enough———.

(c) He came here with a view to—–

(d) Hasib behaves as if———-.

(e) You had better————-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) The weather is so cold that we can't go out.  
Because "so ... that" shows cause and result; the clause after "that" expresses the result.

(b) He was strong enough to lift the box.  
"Enough" + adjective/adverb is followed by "to" + infinitive to show ability or degree.

(c) He came here with a view to finding a job.  
"With a view to" is followed by a gerund (verb+ing), so "finding" is required.

(d) Hasib behaves as if he were the owner.  
"As if" with an unreal or hypothetical idea uses the subjunctive "were" to show improbability.

(e) You had better stay at home.  
"Had better" is followed by the base verb to give advice; do not use "to."

Question:
(a) As the poor man was hungry——-

(b) The weather was so cold that———-.

(c) Hasib behaves as if———-.

(d) It is high time we———-

(e) A patriot is respected because———-.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) As the poor man was hungry, he ate the bread. ব্যাখ্যা: এখানে "as" = "because" অর্থে ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে, তাই মূল বাক্যে কারণের ফলাফল দেখাতে সাধারণ ক্রিয়া ব্যবহার করা হয়।

(b) The weather was so cold that the river froze. ব্যাখ্যা: "so ... that" কাঠামো ফলাফল নির্দেশ করে — আবহাওয়ার তীব্রতা এমন ছিল যে নদী জ্বলে গিয়ে ফলে ঘটলো।

(c) Hasib behaves as if he were the owner. ব্যাখ্যা: "as if" একটি কাল্পনিক/অনুরূপ পরিস্থিতি বোঝায়; বাস্তবে না হলেও বর্তমান অনাস্থা দেখাতে অতীত (subjunctive) দিয়ে "were" ব্যবহার করা হয়।

(d) It is high time we left. ব্যাখ্যা: "It is high time" পরবর্তী ক্রিয়া এখনই হওয়া উচিত বোঝাতে অতীতকালের রূপ নেয়, তাই "left" ব্যবহার করা হয়।

(e) A patriot is respected because he loves his country. ব্যাখ্যা: এখানে "because" কারণে ব্যাখ্যা করে—রাষ্টপ্রেমীর দেশপ্রেমই তাকে সম্মান জাগায়।

Question:
(a) United we stand, ————-.

(b) Rupa talks as if————.

(c) Since the body and mind go together,——–

(d) Zinia is so tired ————.

(e) As I had forgotten her, ———.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) United we stand, divided we fall.
Explanation: This is a fixed proverb contrasting unity and division; "divided we fall" completes the antithesis.

(b) Rupa talks as if she knew everything.
Explanation: After "as if" we use the past/subjunctive ("knew") to show the speaker thinks the idea is unreal or doubtful (she does not actually know everything).

(c) Since the body and mind go together, we must take care of both.
Explanation: "Since" gives a reason, so the logical result is an obligation to look after both body and mind together.

(d) Zinia is so tired that she fell asleep.
Explanation: The "so... that" structure links cause and result; extreme tiredness (so tired) produces the result (fell asleep).

(e) As I had forgotten her, I did not invite her.
Explanation: The past perfect "had forgotten" shows the earlier reason for the later result, so the main clause uses simple past to state the consequence (not inviting her).
