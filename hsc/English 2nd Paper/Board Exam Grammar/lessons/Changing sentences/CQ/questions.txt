(Make it comparative) (d) Though cricket is a costly game, people of all classes enjoy playing it. (Make it simple) (e) Bangladesh is a test playing country but its standard is not high. (Make it complex)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) What an exciting game cricket is!

(b) This game is enjoyed by people of all ages

(c) At present it is more popular than most other games in our country

(d) People of all classes enjoy playing cricket despite its beibg a costly game.

(e) Though Bangladesh is a test playing country, its standard is not high.

Explanation:
(a) What an exciting game cricket is!  
Explanation: Exclamatory sentences show strong feeling and often begin with "what" or "how"; here the inverted "What an exciting game cricket is!" expresses strong emotion.

(b) This game is enjoyed by people of all ages.  
Explanation: In passive voice the object ("this game") becomes the subject and the verb uses "be" + past participle ("is enjoyed"), while the original agent follows with "by".

(c) At present, cricket is more popular than any other game in our country.  
Explanation: A comparative form uses "more ... than" to compare cricket with other games, replacing the superlative "the most" with a comparative structure.

(d) People of all classes enjoy playing cricket despite its cost.  
Explanation: A simple sentence has one independent clause; using "despite" expresses the contrast within a single clause so the sentence remains simple.

(e) Although Bangladesh is a test-playing country, its standard is not high.  
Explanation: A complex sentence contains a main clause and a subordinate clause joined by a subordinating conjunction ("although"), showing contrast between the two ideas.

Options:


Correct Answer: (a) Is anger anything but a vice?(b) It begets nothing but the worst.

(c) So, it should be controlled for our own sake (by us) .

(d) An angry man causes a lot of troubles.

(e) We should realize it and try to be emotionally balanced.

Also change "nothing but" to "anything but" in interrogatives, giving "Is anger anything but a vice?" For (b): make the statement negative by replacing "only" with "nothing but" to show exclusiveness, so "It begets only the worst." becomes "It begets nothing but the worst."

(c) My present house for living is comfortable.

(d) Everybody admired his speech.

(e) Though it disturbed him, he did not know the reason.

Explanation:
Explanation: "Refused" means he declined or would not accept something, so changing it to a negative simple past keeps the same meaning. Thus "Helal did not accept/take/receive the money" correctly expresses the negative idea in ordinary past-tense English.

(c) Everybody admires and respects them greatly (Make it passive). (d) Nobody denies their contribution to their motherland (Make it interrogative). (e) They will never be forgotten by their countrymen to the end (Make it affirmative).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) We are very much proud of our freedom fighters, and they fought for the country with patriotic zeal.
Explanation: This joins two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction "and," making a compound sentence.

(b) They are courageous sons of our nation.
Explanation: "Most courageous" is a superlative; changing it to "courageous" gives the positive degree while keeping the meaning.

(c) They are greatly admired and respected by everybody.
Explanation: The object "them" becomes the subject and the verb becomes passive ("are admired and respected"), with the original agent expressed by "by everybody."

(d) Does anybody deny their contribution to their motherland?
Explanation: To form a question, "nobody" changes to "anybody" and we add the auxiliary "does" before the subject.

(e) Their countrymen will remember them to the end.
Explanation: The negative passive "will never be forgotten" is turned into an affirmative active sentence by using "will remember."

Question:
The Tajmahal, the unique tomb is the 7th wonder of the world. (a) It was three hundred years ago since emperor Shah Jahan built the Taj. (Make it simple). (b) As he loved his wife Mumtaz very much, he built it as a tomb of his dear wife (Make it compound). (c) The building was made with fine white marbles. (Make it active). (d) It rests on a platform of red stone, therefore it looks very nice. (Make it complex). (e) The Tajmahal is one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. (Make it positive). Many tourists come here to enjoy the scenery of the Taj.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) Emperor Shah Jahan built the Taj three hundred years ago. This is simpler because it uses one clear independent clause with the time phrase at the end, avoiding the wordy "It was ... since" construction.

(b) He loved his wife Mumtaz very much, so he built the Taj as her tomb. This is compound because it joins two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction "so" and a comma, showing cause and result while keeping both clauses able to stand alone.

(c) Builders made the building with fine white marble. This is active voice: the doer ("Builders") comes before the verb, making the action direct; also use the uncountable noun "marble" instead of "marbles."

(d) It looks very nice because it rests on a platform of red stone. This is complex because it has an independent clause plus a subordinate clause introduced by "because," which gives the reason and cannot stand alone.

(e) The Tajmahal is beautiful. This is the positive form because it states a quality directly without comparison (no comparative or superlative).

Many tourists come here to enjoy the scenery of the Taj.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) Emperor Shah Jahan built the Taj three hundred years ago. — This is a simple sentence with a clear subject‑verb‑object order and a time expression.

(b) He loved his wife Mumtaz very much, so he built it as her tomb. — Two independent clauses are joined by the coordinating conjunction "so," forming a compound sentence that shows cause and effect.

(c) Artisans built the building using fine white marble. — The active voice names the doer ("Artisans") performing the action, replacing the passive form.

(d) It looks very nice because it rests on a platform of red stone. — A main clause plus a subordinate "because" clause gives the reason, making the sentence complex.

(e) The Tajmahal is a beautiful building. — This uses the positive degree ("beautiful") rather than a comparative or superlative, stating the quality without comparison.

Options:

Explanation:
Explanation: The sentence is negative because it contains the negation "not" after the auxiliary verb "will" (i.e., "will not come"), so it denies the occurrence of success. Therefore the correct classification is (c) Negative.

Solution:


Explanation:
ক বাক্যটি শক্ত অনুভব প্রকাশ করে, তাই এটিকে বিমর্ষ-বিস্ময়সূচক হিসেবে করা যায় — উদাহরণ: “What an exciting game cricket is!” বা “How exciting cricket is!” — ফলে এটি exclamatory হয়।

গ “the most popular” হচ্ছে সর্বাধিকারী রূপ; positive করতে সাধারণভাবে গুণবাচক রূপ ব্যবহার করা হয়: “Cricket is popular in our country.” — ফলে তুলনামূলক শব্দগুলো অপসারিত হয়।  
ঘ “one of the weakest” অন্য দেশের সঙ্গে তুলনা নির্দেশ করে, তাই এটি comparative ধারণা দেয়; বিকল্প comparative হিসেবে বলা যায়: “Bangladesh is weaker than many other Test-playing countries.”

Question:
(a) Jim and Della sacrificed their dearest possessions in order to buy nice Christmas presents for each other. (Make it compound) (b) Della had an ardent desire to give her husband a worthy gift. (Make it complex) (c) Jim also thought how he could give his wife a nice gift. (Make it simple) (d) Della saved a scanty amount of money for this. (Make it passive) (e) Jim was one of the sincerest husbands that we have ever known. (Make it positive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
a Jim and Della sacrificed their dearest possessions, and they bought nice Christmas presents for each other.
This is compound because it joins two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction "and."

b Because Della had an ardent desire to give her husband a worthy gift, she saved every penny she could.
This is complex because it contains a subordinate (dependent) clause beginning with "Because" that gives the reason, plus a main clause.

c Jim thought about giving his wife a nice gift.
This is a simple sentence: one independent clause with a single main idea and no subordinate clauses.

d A scanty amount of money was saved by Della for this.
This is passive because the original object ("a scanty amount of money") becomes the subject and the verb uses a form of "to be" plus the past participle "saved," with "by Della" showing the agent.

e Jim was a sincere husband.
This is the positive degree: it removes the comparative/superlative phrasing and uses the base adjective "sincere" to describe Jim.

Question:
(a) The old sailor shot the Albatross (Passive). (b) At this the sailors were very angry with him. (Negative) (c) Their throats were dry and they could not speak (Complex). (d) Since the old sailor killed the bird, he brought bad luck to the sailors (Simple). (e) It was a very unlucky day (Exclamatory).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) The Albatross was shot by the old sailor. — Passive voice makes the object of the active sentence the subject; use the appropriate form of “be” + past participle and add the agent with “by.”  
(b) At this the sailors were not very angry with him. — Make a sentence negative by placing “not” after the auxiliary verb “were.”  
(c) Their throats were so dry that they could not speak. — A complex sentence is formed by joining a main clause and a dependent clause with a subordinating conjunction like “that” to show cause/result.  
(d) The old sailor killed the bird and brought bad luck to the sailors. — A simple sentence can have one subject with a compound predicate (two verbs), so both actions stay in a single independent clause.  
(e) What a very unlucky day it was! — Exclamatory sentences use “What/How” constructions and an exclamation mark to express strong feeling.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Incorrect — "A true friend is an asset." is a simple declarative sentence with a single independent clause, so it is not a complex sentence.  
(b) Incorrect — this is a complex sentence because it has a main clause ("He helps his friend") plus a subordinate adverbial clause ("when he is in danger"), and complex sentences contain an independent clause plus one or more dependent clauses.  
(c) Incorrect — "He does not leave his friend." is negative (contains "does not"), so it is not affirmative.  
(d) Incorrect — "A true friend is hardly found." is passive in form ("is found"); the active equivalent would be "People hardly find a true friend."  
(e) Correct — "He is as good as an honest man." uses the "as ... as" structure to compare equality, so it is a comparative (comparison of equality).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Negative: "Not everybody lives in society." — Because to make a negative of a universal subject like "everybody" we use "not everybody" to deny the universal claim.  
(b) Affirmative: "We should respect (or maintain) social order." — Removing "not" and using a positive verb gives the affirmative equivalent of the negative sentence.  
(c) Simple: "Maintaining it will enable us to lead a peaceful life." — This is a single independent clause (with a gerund phrase), so it is a simple sentence expressing the same idea.  
(d) Assertive: "Everyone likes peace." — Turning the question into a declarative statement gives an assertive sentence that states the general truth.  
(e) Active: "People require it so much." — Changing the passive construction "is required" into an active verb with an agent ("people") produces the active-voice sentence.

Question:
There are many virtues that man should possess. (a) Truthfulness is one of the greatest virtues in a man’s life. (Make it comparative). It indicates the quality of a man. (b) Everybody respects a truthful person. (Make it interrogative) (c) A truthful person may lead a poor life  but is honoured everywhere. (Make it simple) (d) A truthful person is not afraid of anybody. (Make it complex) (e) It brings peace in one’s mind. (Make it passive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:

(a) Truthfulness is more important than most other virtues in a man's life.
This uses the comparative form "more important than" to compare truthfulness with other virtues.

(b) Does everybody respect a truthful person?
To form a present‑simple question for the third‑person subject "everybody," we add the auxiliary "does" before the subject.

(c) A truthful person may be poor but honoured everywhere.
This is a simple sentence with a single verb phrase "may be" and two adjectives ("poor," "honoured"), keeping the idea concise without extra clauses.

(d) A truthful person is not afraid of anybody because he always speaks the truth.
This is a complex sentence: the main clause "A truthful person is not afraid of anybody" is joined to the subordinate clause "because he always speaks the truth," which gives the reason.

(e) Peace is brought to one's mind by truthfulness.
The sentence is made passive by turning the object "peace" into the subject and introducing the agent "truthfulness" with "by."

Question:
(a) Anika wrote a letter to her mother yesterday. (passive) (b) She told her mother to send Tk. 1000 to buy some books, (complex) (c) In the letter, she told her that she should not worry about her studies. (simple) (d) Her mother often writes to her. (interrogative) (e) She feels that her mother is better than ail other mothers in the world. (superlative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:

(a) A letter was written to her mother by Anika yesterday. In passive voice the object ("a letter") becomes the subject and the past tense verb "wrote" becomes "was written"; "by Anika" names the original doer and "yesterday" stays as the time expression.

(b) She told her mother that she should send Tk. 1000 to buy some books. To form a complex sentence, the reported command is turned into a subordinate noun clause introduced by "that" (which functions as the object of "told") and "should send" is used for the reported instruction; thus the sentence has a main clause plus a subordinate clause.

(c) She told her not to worry about her studies in the letter. This is a simple sentence (one independent clause) using the infinitive "not to worry" to report the advice concisely, with "in the letter" indicating where it was said.

(d) Does her mother often write to her? Make it interrogative by inserting the auxiliary "does" for present simple and using the base form "write"; the adverb "often" stays in its usual position.

(e) She feels that her mother is the best mother in the world. "Best" is the superlative of "good" and requires the definite article "the" because it compares her mother as highest in quality among all mothers.

(Make it compound) (d) I was very glad to see the sea-beach. (Make it exclamatory) (e) It was one of the most memorable journeys in my life. (Make it positive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Did my friend invite me to pay a visit to Cox’s Bazar?
This is the interrogative form of the past simple: we add the auxiliary "did" and use the base verb "invite."

(b) The invitation was gladly accepted (by me).
In the passive voice the object "the invitation" becomes the subject and we use "was" + past participle "accepted"; the agent "by me" is optional.

(c) I reached there and my friend received me cordially.
A compound sentence joins two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction "and," keeping both clauses complete.

(d) How glad I was to see the sea-beach!
An exclamatory sentence uses "How" + adjective + subject + verb to express strong feeling.

(e) It was a memorable journey in my life.
To make it positive, replace the superlative phrase "one of the most memorable" with the positive adjective "memorable."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(d) is correct because the clause "is taken by anger" uses the auxiliary verb "is" + past participle "taken" and an agent introduced by "by," so the subject receives the action (passive voice). The other sentences are active or descriptive (for example, (c) "we should control it" is active and (b) is a linking/descriptive statement).

Question:
There are two ways of developing competence in a language acquiring-the language or learning it. (a) Acquiring a language is more successful than learning, (Make it positive) (b) Teachers encourage the learners of a second language to practice the language. (Make it passive), (c) Students who wish to acquire proficiency in language should practice, the language. (Make it smile) (d) Communicative competence can be achieved in a short-time. (Make it interrogative without changing meaning), (e) A language learner must shake off reticence and he is sure to succeed in his effort. (Make it complex)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Acquiring a language is successful.
Explanation: This uses the positive degree "successful" instead of the comparative "more successful than," stating the idea simply.

(b) Learners of a second language are encouraged by teachers to practice the language.
Explanation: The active object "the learners..." becomes the subject and the verb uses "be + past participle" to form the passive, with the agent "by teachers."

(c) Students who want to acquire proficiency in the language should practice it.
Explanation: This simplifies wording ("want to" and "practice it") while keeping the original meaning.

(d) Can communicative competence be achieved in a short time?
Explanation: Form the question by inverting the auxiliary "can" and the subject; the meaning remains the same.

(e) If a language learner shakes off reticence, he is sure to succeed in his effort.
Explanation: This is a complex sentence: the conditional subordinate clause "If..." gives the condition for the main clause, combining the two original sentences into one.

Question:
(a) E-mail is a computer-based messaging system. (complex) It is a speedy mode of communication, (b) It eliminates the time spent in establishing phone calls. (interrogative) (c) It is cheaper than telephone calls. (positive) It permits communication between two parties without the parties actually being present simultaneously. (d) It takes only a few seconds to transmit a message from one country to another. (negative) It has, however, not reached everyone, especially in developing countries like ours. (e) But even here people use commercially  operated e-mail facilities for important purposes. (passive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Most of the given labels are incorrect. "E-mail is a computer-based messaging system." and "It eliminates the time spent in establishing phone calls." are simple declarative sentences (single independent clauses), so they are not "complex" or "interrogative." "It is cheaper than telephone calls." uses the comparative form "cheaper" (not the positive degree), while "It has, however, not reached everyone..." is correctly negative because of "not"; and "But even here people use commercially operated e-mail facilities..." is active voice, not passive (passive would be "are used").

Question:
Frugality is a good habit. (a) A man who is frugal does not like to spend money without reasons. (simple) (b) The target of a frugal man is to save money for future, (complex) (c) Every one should practise frugality to make a well-planned family. (passive) (d) Since a frugal man saves money, he can spend it in time of crisis. (compound) (e) A frugal man is happier than a prodigal man. (positive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) This is a simple sentence because it has one main idea expressed by a single finite verb phrase "does not like"; the relative clause "who is frugal" only modifies "man" and does not form a separate independent clause.

(b) This is complex because it contains a subordinate infinitive clause "to save money for future" functioning as the complement of "is", so the sentence has one main clause plus a dependent clause.

(c) Passive form: "Frugality should be practised by everyone to make a well-planned family." It is passive because the object "frugality" becomes the subject and the verb uses "should be + past participle (practised)", with "everyone" shifted to "by everyone".

(d) Compound form: "A frugal man saves money, so he can spend it in time of crisis." This is compound because it joins two independent clauses ("A frugal man saves money" and "he can spend it in time of crisis") with the coordinating conjunction "so".

(e) Positive degree: "A prodigal man is not as happy as a frugal man." This uses the positive adjective "happy" with the structure "not as ... as" to express the same comparison without the comparative form "happier".

Question:
(a) Water, an important element of environment, is polluted by various ways, (complex) (b) The water which is pure is necessary for us. (simple) (c) Men polluted water by throwing waste in it. (compound) (d) The farmers use water in time of cultivation largely, (passive) (e) It is one of the most important elements of all living beings, (positive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
ক Incorrect — the sentence has one main clause with an appositive phrase ("an important element of environment"), so it is a simple sentence, not a complex one.  

খ Incorrect — "which is pure" is a relative (dependent) clause modifying "water", so the sentence has a dependent clause plus an independent clause and is therefore complex.  

গ Incorrect — "by throwing waste in it" is an adverbial participle phrase; the sentence has a single subject and verb, so it is a simple sentence, not a compound sentence.  

ঘ Incorrect — the subject "The farmers" performs the action ("use"), so the sentence is active; a passive form would be "Water is used by the farmers…".  

ঙ Incorrect — "one of the most important" uses the superlative form "most important," so this is superlative (not the positive degree).

Question:
(a)The birds that come to our country in winter are called migratory birds. (Make it simple) b In winter the weather is too cold for them to live in the north. (Make it complex) (c) They :”:nd a better shelter in Bangladesh, (Make it passive) (d) We must protect them. (Make it negative) (e) Migratory birds run faster than the dove. (Make it positive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) Simple: Birds that come to our country in winter are migratory birds.
This is simpler because it removes the extra word "called" and keeps the meaning clear and direct.

(b) Complex: Because the weather in the north becomes too cold for them in winter, they cannot live there and so migrate to warmer places.
This is more complex because it uses a dependent clause ("Because...") and links cause and effect, showing reason and result in one sentence.

(c) Passive: A better shelter is found by them in Bangladesh.
This is passive because the object "a better shelter" becomes the subject of the sentence and the doer ("them") follows with "by."

(d) Negative: We must not fail to protect them.
This keeps the original obligation but expresses it negatively, using "must not fail to" to preserve the meaning of necessity.

(e) Positive: The dove is not as fast as migratory birds.
This uses the positive degree "fast" with "not as...as" to express the same comparison without using the comparative form "faster."

(a) Water, a vital element of environment, is polluted in different ways. (complex) People pollute water by throwing waste into it. Fanners use chemicals, fertilizers and insecticides in the fields. (b) When rain and flood wash away some of these chemicals, they get mixed with water. (simple) (c) Mills and factories also pollute water. (passive) (d) Water vehicles pollute rivers by dumping oil, food waste and human waste into them. (compound) (e) Thus water is contaminated by various kinds of waste and filth. (Active)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) This sentence is actually simple, not complex; it has one independent clause and the phrase "a vital element of environment" is an appositive, not a subordinate clause.  
(b) This is complex because it contains a subordinate adverbial clause "When rain and flood wash away some of these chemicals" plus the main clause "they get mixed with water."  
(c) This sentence is active, not passive, because the subject "Mills and factories" performs the action "pollute."  
(d) This is a simple (and active) sentence, not a compound one, because it has a single independent clause with no coordinating conjunction joining two main clauses.  
(e) This sentence is passive, not active: "water" is the patient receiving the action ("is contaminated") and the agent appears after "by."

Question:

(Make it passive) Their colours were very beautiful and (c) he was filled with a strange wonder. (Make it active) Then he felt a great love for them and blessed them from his heart, (d) At once the dead albatross fell from his neck into the sea and the old man fell into a deep sleep. (Make it complex) (e) When he woke up, it was raining. (Make it simple)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) But at last God did not fail to take pity on him.
Explanation: Using the negative of "fail" preserves the original affirmative meaning; "did not fail to take pity" equals "finally took pity."

(b) One day the water-snakes swimming round the ship were being watched by the old sailor.
Explanation: In passive voice the object ("the water-snakes") becomes the subject and the active verb "was watching" becomes "were being watched" with the agent introduced by "by."

(c) A strange wonder filled him.
Explanation: Make the original passive subject ("he") the object and the cause ("a strange wonder") the subject, using an active verb ("filled").

(d) As soon as the dead albatross fell from his neck into the sea, the old man fell into a deep sleep.
Explanation: This is a complex sentence because it joins a subordinate time clause ("As soon as...") with the main clause, showing the sequence of events in one sentence.

(e) He woke up to find it raining.
Explanation: This is a simple sentence (one main clause) that combines the ideas by using "to find" plus a -ing verb to express that it was raining when he woke.

Question:
(a) The National Memorial, which is situated at Savar, is a symbol of the nation’s respect. (Simple) (b) Standing in front of the graves, we bow down our heads. (Compound) (c) The towers symbolize the loftiness of the spirit of the martyred freedom fighters. (Interrogative) (d) We always remember their memories. (Negative) (e) Everyday many people go to visit it. (Interrogative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) The label "Simple" is incorrect — this is a complex sentence because the main clause "The National Memorial ... is a symbol of the nation’s respect" is modified by the subordinate relative clause "which is situated at Savar."  
(b) The label "Compound" is incorrect — the sentence has one main clause "we bow down our heads" and a dependent participial phrase "Standing in front of the graves," so it is complex (or a simple clause with a non‑finite modifier), not a compound sentence.  
(c) The label "Interrogative" is incorrect — this is a simple declarative sentence: subject "The towers" + verb "symbolize" stating a fact, not asking a question.  
(d) The label "Negative" is incorrect — the sentence is affirmative (positive) declarative because it contains no negative word (like "not" or "never"); it simply states that we remember.  
(e) The label "Interrogative" is incorrect — this is a simple declarative sentence ("Many people go to visit it every day.") that states a fact rather than asking a question.

Question:
(a) Very few insects are as busy as a bee. (Make it comparative) It is known as an industrious creature, (b) It only lives in a hive. (Make it negative) (c) It flies from flower to flower to collect honey. (Make it compound) (d) Collected honey is stored in the hive. (Make it active) (e) In winter, it remains idle, but works hard in spring. (Make it complex)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
a A bee is busier than most insects. 
This uses the comparative adjective "busier" with "than" to compare the bee to other insects.

b It lives nowhere except in a hive. 
"Nowhere except" is a negative construction that denies any other place of living.

c It flies from flower to flower, and it collects nectar to make honey. 
Two independent clauses joined by "and" form a compound sentence.

d Bees store collected honey in the hive. 
This is active voice: the subject "Bees" performs the action "store."

e Although it remains idle in winter, it works hard in spring. 
A complex sentence has a dependent clause ("Although it remains idle in winter") linked to the main clause to show contrast.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
A simple/assertive sentence has a single independent clause stating a fact, so "Raju is a good boy." and "He is an active man." are simple assertive sentences.  
"I do not know his father’s name." is a simple negative sentence because it contains one clause with negation ("do not").  
"But I know the place where he was born." is complex because it has a main clause plus a subordinate clause ("where he was born"), and "Though he is poor, he is honest." is also complex (a concessive subordinate clause + a main clause).  
"What a simple life he leads!" is exclamatory because it expresses strong feeling, while "He is the best player." is a simple assertive sentence stating a fact.

(a) Long long ago there was a king who was very wise. (Make it simple) (b) People called him wise Solomon. (Make it passive) (c) Actually, at that time he was the wisest of all. (Make it comparative) (d) There was another ruler also named queen of Sheba. (Make it compound) (e) One day she thought wisdom should not remain untested. (Make it complex)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) A long time ago there was a very wise king.
This simplifies "Long long ago" to the common phrase "A long time ago" and keeps one independent clause, so the sentence is simple.

(b) He was called Wise Solomon by the people.
This is passive: the object ("him") becomes the subject ("He"), the verb becomes "was called," and the agent is shown with "by the people."

(c) At that time he was wiser than everyone else.
This uses the comparative form "wiser than" to compare him with others instead of the superlative "wisest."

(d) There was another ruler, and she was the queen of Sheba.
This is a compound sentence because it joins two independent clauses ("There was another ruler" and "she was the queen of Sheba") with the coordinating conjunction "and."

(e) One day she thought that wisdom should not remain untested.
This is complex because it has a main clause ("she thought") and a subordinate noun clause introduced by "that" ("that wisdom should not remain untested") which depends on the main clause.

(interrogative) (e) But the cook told him that this duck had only one leg. (negative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) This sentence is active, not passive, because the subject "a cook" performs the action "roasted" on the object "a duck"; a passive form would be "A duck was roasted by a cook...".  
(b) It is not a simple sentence but a complex one: the main clause "The roast looked so delicious" is followed by a dependent result clause introduced by "that" ("that the cook could not resist...").  
(c) This is complex, not compound, because it has a subordinate time clause "When his master sat down to eat" plus a main clause "he quickly noticed..."; a compound sentence would consist of two independent clauses.  
(d) This is declarative, not interrogative; it states information ("The master enquired...") rather than asking a question (an interrogative would be phrased as a question).  
(e) This is not negative; there's no negation word. It is a declarative complex sentence with a reporting verb plus a "that"-clause ("the cook told him that...").

(e) It seemed to the fox that it was the happiest animal in the world. (comparative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Only (b) is correct. "The fox was thirsty and was looking for water." is a simple sentence because it has one subject performing two linked actions (a compound predicate). The others are mislabelled: "A cunning fox was passing through a forest" is simple, not complex; "It could not find any source of water" is active, not passive; "He felt very helpless" is declarative, not interrogative; and "It seemed to the fox that it was the happiest animal in the world" uses the superlative "happiest," not a comparative.

(Make it compound) (d) He can succeed in life. (Make it interrogative) (e) Everybody must be conscious of health. (Make it negative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) Complex sentence: "Health, which enables us to enjoy life, is wealth." This is complex because it has a main clause plus a subordinate (relative) clause "which enables us to enjoy life" that gives extra information about "health."

(b) Positive (positive degree/structure): "A sick moneyed man is not as happy as a healthy poor man." This converts the comparative "happier than" into a positive construction "not as ... as," which is the standard way to express the same comparison in positive form.

(c) Compound sentence: "A healthy man is an asset to his family, but an unhealthy man is a liability." Two independent clauses are joined by the coordinating conjunction "but," making the sentence compound.

(d) Interrogative: "Can he succeed in life?" Form a yes/no question by placing the auxiliary verb "can" before the subject "he."

(e) Negative: "Everybody must not be careless about their health." This introduces negation ("must not" + opposite adjective "careless") to make the sentence negative while preserving the original meaning.

ক বাক্যকে নেতিবাচক করতে 'is' এর পরে 'not' যোগ করে বা বিপরীত অর্থের শব্দ ব্যবহার করতে হয়; সুতরাং সঠিক নেতিবাচক রূপ: "Day-to-day life in Dhaka is not cheap." এটি মূল বক্তব্যের বিপরীত বা অস্বীকার প্রকাশ করে।  

খ এখানে "living below the poverty line" একটি participle phrase যা মানুষকে ব্যাখ্যা করে, অর্থাৎ বাক্যে একটি অনির্ভর উপাদান আছে; এ কারণেই এটি জটিল (complex) ধরনের—একটি প্রধান ক্লজের সঙ্গে উপবৃত্তি অংশ আছে।  

গ বাক্যটি ইতিবাচক (positive) কারণ এটি কোনো অস্বীকার বা নেতিবাচক শব্দ ছাড়াই সরাসরি তথ্য জানায়: "Price hike is one of the biggest problems for them." ইতিবাচক বাক্যে সাধারণত 'not' বা বিরোধী কনস্ট্রাকশন থাকে না।  

ঘ সক্রিয় বাক্যকে passive এ রূপান্তর করার নিয়ম: বস্তুকে বিষয় বানানো এবং ক্রিয়ার সহায়ক + past participle ব্যবহার করা; তাই passive রূপ হবে: "Necessary measures have been taken by the government to keep the price hike under control." এখানে মূল বস্তু (necessary measures) এখন বাক্যের বিষয় এবং 'have been taken' passive ফর্ম।  

ঙ সরল (simple) রূপে relative clause সরিয়ে adjective ব্যবহার করা যায়: "Greedy people are responsible for the price spiral." এভাবে একক স্বাধীন ক্লজ রেখে বাক্যটি সরল করা হয়।

Question:
(a) Very few insects are as busy as a bee. (make it comparative) It is known as an industrious creature, (b) It lives together. (make it negative) (c) It flies from flower to flower and collects honey. (make it simple) (d) It stores honey in the hive. (make it passive) (e) In winter, it remains idle but it works hard in spring. (make it complex) It leads a disciplined life.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
ক A bee is busier than most insects. This is comparative because "busier than" clearly compares the degree of busyness of a bee with that of other insects.

খ It does not live alone. In simple present for third-person singular, make a negative with "does not" + base verb ("live").

গ It collects honey from flowers. This is a simple sentence with one subject ("It"), one verb ("collects") and a direct object ("honey from flowers").

ঘ Honey is stored in the hive by the bee. Passive voice uses the appropriate form of "be" + past participle ("is stored"), so the original object ("honey") becomes the subject.

ঙ Although it remains idle in winter, it works hard in spring and leads a disciplined life. This is a complex sentence because the subordinate clause ("Although it remains idle in winter") contrasts with the main clause ("it works hard in spring and leads a disciplined life"), joined by the subordinating conjunction "although".

Question:
(a) Cox’s Bazar sea-beach is the longest sea-beach in the world. (complex) (b) It is one of the most beautiful sea-beaches in the world. (positive) (c) It is called pleasure seeker’s paradise. (active) (d) The visitors go there for enjoying natural beauties. (compound) (e) Those who become tired may go to relax there. (simple)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Correct: simple sentence. It has a single independent clause with subject "Cox’s Bazar sea-beach" and predicate "is the longest sea-beach in the world," so there is no subordinate clause or coordination.  

(b) Correct label as positive (affirmative). The sentence is an affirmative/declarative statement (not negative or interrogative), so calling it a positive sentence is appropriate.  

(c) Correct label is passive, not active. "It is called..." is passive voice because the subject receives the naming; an active version would name who calls it a paradise.  

(d) Correct: simple sentence. There is one subject ("The visitors") and one main verb ("go"), with a prepositional phrase ("for enjoying natural beauties"); no second independent clause or subordinating clause.  

(e) Correct: complex sentence. It contains a main clause ("Those ... may go to relax there") plus a dependent relative clause ("who become tired") that modifies "Those," so the sentence is complex.

Question:
(a) Cricket is a very exciting game. (complex) (b) People all over the world enjoy this game very much. (passive) (c) At present cricket is one of the most popular games in our country. (comparative) (d) Though it is a very costly game, young men and children get a great deal of delight playing it. (compound) (e) It is a matter of sorrow that the performance of Bangladesh Cricket Team is not up to the mark. (exclamatory)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) The label "complex" is incorrect — this is a simple declarative sentence with a single independent clause and no subordinate clause.  
(b) The label "passive" is incorrect — the sentence is active (subject "People" performs the action); passive would be "This game is enjoyed by people all over the world."  
(c) The label "comparative" is incorrect — "one of the most popular" shows the superlative degree ("most"), not a comparative.  
(d) The label "compound" is incorrect — this is a complex sentence: a subordinate clause introduced by "Though" plus a main clause.  
(e) The label "exclamatory" is incorrect — this is a declarative sentence with a noun clause ("that...") stating a fact, not an exclamation.

Question:
(a) The Jamuna is one of the biggest rivers in Bangladesh. (make it comparative) (b) When it is summer, it becomes emaciated. (make it simple) (c) During the rainy season, it assumes a terrible shape. (make it complex) (d) Every body knows it. (make it interrogative) (e) Tourists from home and abroad visit its shore. (make it passive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
ক The Jamuna is bigger than most rivers in Bangladesh.
- We use the comparative adjective "bigger" with "than" to compare the Jamuna to other rivers; this changes the original superlative phrase into a direct comparison.

খ In summer it becomes emaciated.
- Converting the time clause "When it is summer" into the adverbial phrase "In summer" and keeping a single main verb makes the sentence a simple (one-clause) sentence.

গ When the rainy season comes, it assumes a terrible shape.
- This is a complex sentence because it has a subordinate adverbial clause ("When the rainy season comes") plus a main clause ("it assumes a terrible shape"), linking time and result.

ঘ Does everybody know it?
- Form the question by adding the auxiliary "does" before the subject "everybody" and using the base verb "know"; this changes the declarative into an interrogative.

ঙ Its shore is visited by tourists from home and abroad.
- To make the sentence passive, make the object ("its shore") the subject, use the appropriate form of "be" + past participle ("is visited"), and optionally keep the agent with "by tourists from home and abroad."

Solution:


Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:
ক বাক্যটি একটিই স্বাধীন বাক্যাংশ রয়েছে — অতএব এটি সরল (simple) বিবৃতিবাক্য; "complex" বলা ভুল।  
খ এখানে "when the roads get so jam packed" নামক একটি অবলম্বনকারী (dependent) বা অনুচ্ছেদীয় ক্লজ আছে, তাই এটি জটিল (complex) বাক্য; "simple" বলা সঠিক নয়।  
গ বিষয় (Almost everyone) কাজটি করে — فعل active voice-এ আছে, তাই এটি passive নয়; সঠিকভাবে বলা গেলে এটি সক্রিয় সরল বাক্য।  
ঘ "Although I hate gathering" একটি অনুচ্ছেদীয় (subordinate) ক্লজ এবং "I enjoy..." একটি স্বাধীন ক্লজ — এটি complex (ঋণাত্মক/কনসেসিভ) বাক্য; compound বলা ভুল।  
ঙ "How enthusiastic the people look on this day!" আবেগ বা বিস্ময় প্রকাশ করে, তাই এটি exclamatory (উৎকণ্ঠাজনক) বাক্য, assertive (সাধারণ বিবৃতিপ্রকার) নয়।

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Only c is correct: "Toronto is one of the most expensive cities of the world." is a positive (affirmative) declarative sentence because it states a fact without negation or question form.  
a is a simple sentence (one independent clause), not a complex sentence.  
b is affirmative (she loves gardening); a negative version would use negation (e.g., "His wife Catherine does not love gardening").  
d is negative-declarative ("They don’t realize..."); the interrogative form would be "Don’t they realize...?"

Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
ক "যেহেতু স্বাস্থ্যই ধন, তাই মানুষের নিজের স্বাস্থ্যের যত্ন নেওয়া উচিত।"  
এটি একটি জটিল (complex) বাক্য কারণ এতে উপবাক্য "যেহেতু..." (কারণবাচক) এবং একটি মূল বাক্য আছে; উপবাক্য কারণ জানিয়েছে এবং মূল বাক্য সেই কারণ থেকে সিদ্ধান্ত বা উপদেশ দিচ্ছে।

খ "একজন সুস্থ গরীব মানুষ সুখী, আর একজন অসুস্থ ধনী মানুষ সুখী নয়।"  
এখানে তুলনামূলক রূপ বাদ দিয়ে সরল ধনাত্মক (positive) অবস্থা প্রকাশ করা হয়েছে—দুটি ব্যক্তির অবস্থা অক্সিজেনশূন্যভাবে(base adjective) দেওয়া হয়েছে, তাই এটি positive degree এ আছে।

গ "একজন সুস্থ ব্যক্তি তার পরিবারের জন্য সম্পদ, কিন্তু একজন অসুস্থ ব্যক্তি বোঝা।"  
এটি একটি যৌগিক (compound) বাক্য কারণ এতে দুইটি স্বাধীন বাক্যকে সমন্বয়কারী conjunction "কিন্তু" দিয়ে যুক্ত করা হয়েছে; প্রথম অংশ নিজে থেকেই সম্পূর্ণ এবং দ্বিতীয় অংশও নিজে থেকেই সম্পূর্ণ।

ঘ "সে কি জীবনে সফল হতে পারে?"  
বাংলা প্রশ্ন করতে সাধারণত বিষয়-এর পরে প্রশ্নচিহ্নী কণা "কি" ব্যবহার করা হয় বা সাহায্যকারী ক্রিয়া ও বিষয়কে আদলে ঘুরিয়ে রাখা হয়; এখানে "কি" যোগ করে বাক্যকে প্রশ্নে রূপান্তর করা হয়েছে।

ঙ প্রদত্ত বাক্য "Everybody must be co..." অসম্পূর্ণ আছে; পুরো শব্দ বা বাক্য দিলে (উদাহরণ: "Everybody must be cooperative" → "প্রত্যেককে সহযোগিতামূলক হতে হবে") সঠিক রূপান্তর ও ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়া যাবে, অনুগ্রহ করে বাক্যটি সম্পূর্ণ করুন।

(Make it passive) Their colours were very beautiful and (c) he was filled with a strange wonder.

(Make it complex) (e) When he woke up, it was raining. (Make it simple)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) But at last God did not fail to take pity on him.
Explanation: The negative form "did not fail to" keeps the original meaning (affirmative pity) while using a negation; it's a common way to make such sentences negative without changing sense.

(b) One day the water snakes swimming round the ship were being watched by the old sailor.
Explanation: In passive voice the object ("the water snakes") becomes the subject and the past continuous "was watching" becomes "were being watched" (plural subject → "were").

(c) A strange wonder filled him.
Explanation: Change the passive "he was filled with…" to an active verb phrase where the feeling ("a strange wonder") becomes the subject doing the action.

(d) As soon as the dead albatross fell from his neck into the sea, the old man fell into a deep sleep.
Explanation: Use a subordinating conjunction ("as soon as"/"when") to join the two actions into one complex sentence, making one clause dependent on the other to show time/sequence.

(e) He woke up in the rain.
Explanation: Convert the adverbial clause ("When he woke up, it was raining") into a single-clause simple sentence by turning the clause into a prepositional phrase ("in the rain").

(Positive) (d) Bangladesh is one of the weakest test playing countries. (Comparative) So most of the people do not like watching test cricket, (e) They are fond of watching “twenty-twenty” cricket. (Interrogative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Correct exclamatory form: "What an exciting game cricket is!" — Exclamations use special structures like "What a/an + adjective + noun + subject + verb" to show strong feeling.  
(b) Correct passive form: "This game is enjoyed by people of all ages." — Passive puts the object first, uses a form of "be" + past participle, and optionally adds "by" + agent.  
(c) Correct positive form: "Cricket is popular in our country." — Positive degree simply states the quality without comparison or superlative words like "more" or "most."  
(d) Correct comparative form: "Bangladesh is weaker than many other Test-playing countries." — Comparative compares two (or groups) using "er" or "more" + adjective, and usually includes "than."  
(e) Correct interrogative form: "Are they fond of watching twenty-twenty cricket?" — Form questions by inverting the auxiliary verb ("are") and the subject.

(Make it negative) (c) It flies from flower to flower to collect honey. (Make it compound) (d) Collected honey is stored in the hive. (Make it active) (e) In winter, it remains idle, but works hard in spring. (Make it complex)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) A bee is busier than most insects.
This replaces the "as...as" equality with the comparative form "busier than" and uses "most insects" to reflect "very few" being as busy.

(b) It does not live anywhere except in a hive.
This makes the sentence negative by using "does not" and "except" to show the only place it lives.

(c) It flies from flower to flower, and it collects honey.
This is a compound sentence: two independent clauses joined by a comma and the coordinating conjunction "and."

(d) The bee stores the collected honey in the hive.
This changes the passive into active voice by making "the bee" the subject that performs the action.

(e) Although it remains idle in winter, it works hard in spring.
This is a complex sentence using the subordinate conjunction "although" to show contrast between the two clauses.

(b) This is a simple sentence: it has one independent clause ("he joined Cambridge University") with a time phrase ("In 1979").  
(c) This is complex because it contains a subordinate clause ("When he was thirty two years old") plus a main clause ("he received the ... award").  
(d) This is an active simple sentence: the subject "He" performs the action "wrote", and there is only one main clause, so it is not compound.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:

(a) I do not know his father’s name. — This is a simple sentence and specifically a negative declarative sentence because it has one independent clause with the negation "do not".  

(b) But I know the place where he was born. — This is a complex sentence because it has a main clause ("I know the place") plus a subordinate relative clause ("where he was born") that depends on the noun "place".  

(c) Though he is poor, he is honest. — This is a complex sentence (concessive type) since a subordinate clause introduced by "though" ("Though he is poor") is joined to the main clause ("he is honest").  

(d) He is the best player. — This is a simple affirmative sentence (one independent clause expressing a positive statement), not a negative sentence.  

(e) What a simple life he leads! — This is an exclamatory sentence because it expresses strong feeling and ends with an exclamation, not a plain assertive/declarative sentence.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Simple sentence: Long ago there was a very wise king.
Explanation: Removed the repeated "long" and turned the relative clause "who was very wise" into the adjective phrase "very wise king" to make the sentence shorter and direct.

(b) Passive: He was called Solomon the Wise.
Explanation: Passive uses the verb "was called" plus the name/noun phrase; the agent ("people") is optional and omitted for simplicity.

(c) Comparative: At that time he was wiser than everyone.
Explanation: Changed the superlative "the wisest of all" into a comparative form "wiser than everyone" to compare him with others.

(d) Compound: There was another ruler, and she was named the Queen of Sheba.
Explanation: Two independent clauses ("There was another ruler" and "she was named...") are joined by "and," which makes a compound sentence.

(e) Complex: One day she thought that wisdom should not remain untested because she wanted to test it.
Explanation: This has a main clause ("she thought") and a subordinate clause introduced by "that" and another dependent clause introduced by "because," so the sentence becomes complex by showing reason.

(interrogative) (e) But the cook told him that this duck had only one leg. (negative)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) This sentence is active simple past, not passive, because the subject "a cook" performs the action "roasted"; the passive would be "A duck was roasted (for his master)."  
(b) This is a complex sentence, not a simple one, because it has a main clause ("The roast looked so delicious") plus a subordinate result clause introduced by "that" ("that the cook could not resist the temptation").  
(c) This is a complex sentence (adverbial time clause + main clause), not a compound one, because it begins with the subordinate time clause "When his master sat down to eat" followed by the main clause "he quickly noticed the missing drumstick."  
(d) This is declarative, not interrogative; it states information ("The master enquired of the missing leg") rather than asking a question (an interrogative would be "Did the master enquire about the missing leg?").  
(e) This is an affirmative sentence, not negative; "had only one leg" limits the amount but does not use a negation word like "not" or "never."

The others are mislabeled: a and "It was a hot summer day" are simple declarative clauses (not complex, since there is no subordinate clause); c is active voice ("It could not find..."), not passive; d is a declarative sentence, not interrogative; and e uses the superlative "happiest," so it is not a comparative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
Adulteration is the act of making any commodity impure by admixture of other or baser ingredients, (a) This admixture may corrupt the nature of the original commodity. (Make it passive) (b) The value or the effectiveness of the finished product destroyed by adulteration. (Make it active) Adulterated foods and beverages cause a serious health hazards, (c) We have laws and law-enforcing agencies to stop the dishonest businessmen. (Make it complex) (d) Their effort has been proved ineffective since adulteration of foods and other commodities is on the increase. (Make it compound) (e) It is strong public awareness which is essential for the fight against adulteration. (Make it simple)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
a Passive sentence: "The nature of the original commodity may be corrupted by this admixture." Explanation: In passive voice the object ("the nature of the original commodity") becomes the subject and the verb uses a form of "be" + past participle ("may be corrupted"), with the agent introduced by "by".

b Active sentence: "Adulteration destroyed the value or the effectiveness of the finished product." Explanation: Active voice puts the doer ("Adulteration") as the subject performing the action on the object, so the clause is restructured into subject + verb + object.

c Complex sentence: "We have laws and law-enforcing agencies that are meant to stop dishonest businessmen." Explanation: A complex sentence contains a main clause plus a subordinate (here a relative) clause; "that are meant to stop dishonest businessmen" makes the sentence dependent and adds detail about the agencies.

d Compound sentence: "Their efforts have proved ineffective, and adulteration of foods and other commodities is increasing." Explanation: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses ("Their efforts have proved ineffective" and "adulteration... is increasing") with a coordinating conjunction ("and").

e Simple sentence: "Strong public awareness is essential for the fight against adulteration." Explanation: A simple sentence has a single independent clause (subject "Strong public awareness" + predicate "is essential..."), so the cleft construction is simplified to one straightforward statement.

Question:
(a) Water, an important vital clement of environment, is polluted by various ways, (complex) (b) The water which is pure is necessary for us. (simple) Men pollute water by throwing waste in it. (compound) (d) The farmers use water in time of cultivation largely. (passive) (e) It is one of the most important elements of all living beings. (positive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Incorrect — it’s a simple sentence with an appositive noun phrase (“an important ... of environment”) inserted; there is only one independent clause.  
(b) Incorrect — it is a complex sentence because it contains a relative (subordinate) clause “which is pure” modifying “the water.”  
(c) Incorrect — it is a simple sentence: one independent clause (“Men pollute water…”) with a gerund phrase as adverbial, not two independent clauses.  
(d) Incorrect — the sentence is active (subject “The farmers” performs the action); the passive form would be “Water is largely used by the farmers during cultivation.”  
(e) Incorrect — this shows the superlative degree (“one of the most important”), not the positive degree.

Question:
(a) Day to day life in Dhaka is expensive, (negative) (b) People living below the poverty line lead a miserable life, (complex) (c) Price hike is one of the biggest problems for them. (positive) (d) The government has taken necessary measures to keep the price hike under control, (passive) (e) The people who are greedy are responsible for price spiral, (simple)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Incorrect — the sentence is affirmative, not negative; there is no negation word, it simply states that life in Dhaka is expensive.  
(b) Correct — it contains the participle clause "living below the poverty line" that acts as a subordinate modifier, so the sentence is complex.  
(c) Correct — this is a positive (affirmative) statement with no negation or contrast.  
(d) Incorrect — this is active voice in present perfect ("The government has taken…"); a passive form would be "Necessary measures have been taken by the government."  
(e) Incorrect — the relative clause "who are greedy" makes it complex (main clause + subordinate relative clause), so it is not a simple sentence.

Question:
(a) Very few insects are as busy as a bee. (make it comparative) It is known as an industrious creature, (b) It lives together. (make it negative) (c) It flies from flower to flower and collects honey. (make it simple) (d) It stores honey in the hive. (make it passive) (e) In winter, it remains idle but it works hard in spring. (make it complex) It leads a disciplined life.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) A bee is busier than most insects.
Explanation: The "as...as" comparison is changed to a comparative form by using the adjective + -er and "than" to compare the bee with most insects.

(b) It does not live alone.
Explanation: To make the sentence negative in present simple for third person singular, add the auxiliary "does not" + base verb.

(c) It flies from flower to flower to collect honey.
Explanation: Combining the two actions with the infinitive "to collect" makes a single simple sentence expressing one main idea.

(d) Honey is stored in the hive.
Explanation: In the passive voice the object "honey" becomes the subject and the verb becomes "is stored" (agent can be omitted).

(e) Although it remains idle in winter, it works hard in spring.
Explanation: Using the subordinating conjunction "although" joins the clauses into a complex sentence and shows the contrast between winter and spring.

(active) (d) The visitors go there for enjoying natural beauties. (compound) (e) Those who become tired may go to relax there. (simple)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) The label "complex" is incorrect; this is a simple sentence because it contains a single independent clause with one subject ("Cox’s Bazar sea-beach") and one predicate ("is the longest sea-beach in the world").  
(b) The label "positive" is incorrect; the sentence uses a superlative ("the most beautiful"), so it is not in the positive degree.  
(c) The label "active" is incorrect; "is called" is a passive verb form, so the sentence is passive in voice.  
(d) The label "compound" is incorrect; this is a simple sentence with one independent clause ("The visitors go there for enjoying natural beauties"), not two independent clauses joined.  
(e) The label "simple" is incorrect; this is a complex sentence because it contains a main clause ("Those ... may go") plus a subordinate relative clause ("who become tired").

(comparative) (d) Though it is a very costly game, young men and children get a great deal of delight playing it. (compound) (e) It is a matter of sorrow that the performance of Bangladesh Cricket Team is not up to the mark. (exclamatory)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) This is a simple declarative sentence because it has one independent clause with subject "Cricket" and verb "is" and no subordinate or coordinate clause.  
(b) This is an active (not passive) declarative sentence: the subject "People" performs the action "enjoy" on the object "this game"; a passive form would make the object the subject (e.g. "This game is enjoyed…").  
(c) This shows the superlative degree, not the comparative: "most popular" (with "one of the") compares cricket as among the highest degree of popularity, so it’s superlative in meaning.  
(d) This is a complex sentence (not compound) because it has a subordinate concessive clause starting with "Though…" plus a main clause ("young men and children get…").  
(e) This is a declarative complex sentence, not exclamatory: it states a fact and contains a noun clause introduced by "that" as the complement; an exclamatory sentence would express strong feeling and use an exclamation.

Question:
(a) The Jamuna is one of the biggest rivers in Bangladesh. (make it comparative) (b) When it is summer, it becomes emaciated. (make it simple) (c) During the rainy season, it assumes a terrible shape. (make it complex) (d) Every body knows it. (make it interrogative) (e) Tourists from home and abroad visit its shore. (make it passive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
ক The Jamuna is larger than most rivers in Bangladesh.
- This is comparative because it directly compares the Jamuna with other rivers using "larger than"; comparatives use "more/er + than" to show difference between two or more items.

খ In summer the Jamuna becomes thin.
- This is a simple sentence (simple present with a time expression). It has one main clause with a subject and a verb, showing a habitual or general fact.

গ During the rainy season the Jamuna assumes a terrible shape as its waters swell and rush angrily, often eroding banks and causing floods.
- This is a complex sentence because it combines a main clause with a subordinate (reason/result) clause introduced by "as"; complex sentences join an independent clause and one or more dependent clauses to show cause, time, condition, etc.

ঘ Does everybody know it?
- This is the interrogative form: put the auxiliary "does" before the subject "everybody" and use the base verb "know" to form a question.

ঙ Its shore is visited by tourists from home and abroad.
- This is the passive voice: the original object ("its shore") becomes the subject, and the verb uses "be" + past participle ("is visited"); the agent ("by tourists from home and abroad") can follow or be omitted.

(compound) (e) How enthusiastic the people look on this day! (assertive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) The label "complex" is incorrect: the sentence is a single independent clause with a statement, so it is a simple (declarative) sentence.  
(b) The label "simple" is incorrect: the clause "when the roads get so jam packed" is a subordinate (adverbial) clause, so the whole sentence is complex.  
(c) The label "passive" is incorrect: the verb "enjoys" is active and the subject "Almost everyone" performs the action; a passive version would be "the day is enjoyed by almost everyone."  
(d) The label "compound" is incorrect: "Although I hate gathering" is a subordinate clause joined to a main clause, so the sentence is complex (not compound, which needs two independent clauses).  
(e) The label "assertive" is incorrect: the sentence is exclamatory—"How enthusiastic..." expresses strong feeling and is an exclamation, not a neutral declarative statement.

(positive) His relatives often come to stay with him. (d) They don’t realize the high cost of living in Toronto. (interrogative) (e) However, he loves his relatives a great deal. (passive)

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Corrections: (a) is a simple affirmative (positive) sentence because it has one main clause; (b) is also positive/simple — the verb "loves" shows affirmation (the comma is incorrect); (c) "Toronto is one of the most expensive cities of the world" is positive; (d) is negative because it contains the negation "don’t"; (e) is active, not passive, because "he" is the subject doing the action "loves."  
A complex sentence would have a main clause plus a subordinate clause; an interrogative asks a question (usually with subject–auxiliary inversion); a passive uses a form of "be" + past participle so the subject receives the action.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) Health is wealth because without sound health, all other riches lose their value.
This is a complex sentence: it has an independent clause ("Health is wealth") and a dependent clause introduced by "because" that gives a reason, so it shows cause and effect.

(b) A healthy poor man is happier than a wealthy man who is ill.
This is a positive comparative: it emphasizes the positive quality (health and happiness) rather than focusing on negatives, and it clearly compares two people.

(c) A healthy man is an asset to his family, but an unhealthy man is a liability.
This is a compound sentence because it joins two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction "but," showing contrast between them.

(d) Can he succeed in life?
This is an interrogative formed by inverting the modal verb "can" and the subject "he," which turns the statement into a yes/no question.

(e) The sentence "Everybody must be co" is incomplete; please provide the full word (e.g., "cooperative," "courteous") so I can transform or explain it.
An incomplete sentence cannot be accurately changed or analyzed until the intended ending is given.

ঘ. বাক্য (d) কে একটি সরাসরি প্রশ্ন (direct question) হিসেবে পুনর্লিখন করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: (a) A lonely fisherman sat gazing at the dark water.  কারণ: এটি একটি জটিল (complex) বাক্য কারণ এতে একটি মূল clause (A lonely fisherman sat) এবং একটি subordinate participle/gerund phrase (gazing at the dark water) আছে যা মূল কাজের সাথে যুক্ত—অর্থাৎ একটির মধ্যে আরও একটি ব্যাখ্যামূলক অংশ আছে।

খ উত্তর: (b) He wanted to catch fish for his supper.  কারণ: এটি একটি সরল (simple) বাক্য কারণ এতে কেবল একটি স্বাধীন clause রয়েছে — একটি বিষয় (He) এবং একটিpredicate (wanted to catch fish for his supper)। এতে কোনো subordinate clause নেই।

গ উত্তর: Active form of (c): He threw the net into the river.  কারণ: মূল বাক্য ছিল "The net was thrown into the river by him." যা passive voice; passive-কে active-তে রুপান্তর করতে বিষয়কে (he/by him) বাক্যের শুরুতে আনতে হবে এবং verb-কে active form (threw) ব্যবহার করতে হবে।

ঘ উত্তর: Direct question form of (d): What will luck bring him?  OR: What will bring him luck?  কারণ: মূল বাক্যটি ছিল একটি বিবৃতি-আশয়ী (He wondered what luck would bring him). সরাসরি প্রশ্নে এই আনুক্রমিক রূপান্তর করা হয় যাতে প্রশ্নচিহ্ন ব্যবহার করে প্রশ্নটি স্পষ্টভাবে প্রকাশ পায় এবং সহায়ক clause (what luck would bring him) কে প্রশ্নাকারে রূপান্তর করা হয়।

Explanation:
উপরের সমাধানগুলোতে আমরা বাক্যের ধরন নির্ণয় এবং সরল রূপান্তর (passive থেকে active, বিবৃতিকে সরাসরি প্রশ্নে রূপান্তর) দেখিয়েছি। জটিল বাক্যে সাধারণত একটি independent clause-এর সঙ্গে একটি subordinate clause বা participial phrase থাকে; সরল বাক্যে কেবলমাত্র একটি independent clause থাকে। Passive থেকে active-এ রূপান্তরের জন্য "by"-এর দ্বারা নির্দেশিত agent-কে বাক্যের subject করা হয় এবং verb-কে যথাযথ active ফর্মে আনতে হয়। আলোচনা-ধর্মী বা indirect প্রশ্নকে direct question-এ রূপান্তর করার সময় subordinate clause থেকে সরাসরি প্রশ্ন গঠন করতে হবে এবং যথাযথ word-order (auxiliary before subject) বজায় রাখতে হবে।

গ. বাক্য (d) কে একটি সাধারণ প্রশ্ন (interrogative) হিসেবে লিখে দেখাও।
ঘ. বাক্য (e) কে তুলনামূলক রূপে রক্ষা রেখে একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা করো কেন এটি comparative।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: (c) No gardener had been seen there for days.  কারণ: এখানে 'had been seen' একটি passive perfect construction; কাজটি (seeing the gardener) passive voice-এ বিবৃত হয়েছে এবং agent (who saw) উল্লেখ করা হয়নি — তাই এটি প্যাসিভ বাক্য।

খ উত্তর: Simple rephrasing of (b): She wanted to pick a rose for her mother.  কারণ: মূল বাক্যটি হচ্ছে ইচ্ছা-সঙ্কেত (She wished she could pick one for her mother)। সরল বিবৃতিতে আমরা 'wished she could' এর পরিবর্তে সরাসরি 'wanted to' ব্যবহার করে ইচ্ছাকে সরলভাবে প্রকাশ করেছি: 'She wanted to pick a rose for her mother.'

গ উত্তর: Interrogative form of (d): Did the flowers look beautiful to her?  অথবা How did the flowers look to her?  কারণ: (d) একটি exclamatory sentence; তাকে প্রশ্নে রূপান্তর করতে auxiliary 'did' ব্যবহার করে past tense word-order (Did + subject + base verb) প্রয়োগ করা হয়েছে: 'Did the flowers look beautiful to her?'

ঘ উত্তর: (e) She felt happier than she had felt the previous week.  কারণ: এখানে 'happier' হল comparative adjective — দুটি সময়ের অনুভূতির তুলনা করা হচ্ছে (now vs. previous week)। শব্দ 'than' ব্যবহার করে তুলনা স্পষ্ট করা হয়েছে, তাই এটি comparative রূপ।

Explanation:
উত্তরে আমরা passive voice, wish-to-want রূপান্তর, exclamatory থেকে interrogative রূপান্তর এবং comparative চিন্হিতকরণ দেখিয়েছি। Passive বাক্যগুলোতে সাধারণত auxiliary (be/have) + past participle থাকে এবং agent often omitted হয়। 'Wished she could' কে সরলভাবে 'wanted to' বলা যায় যদি আপনি ইচ্ছার বাস্তব প্রয়োগ তুলে ধরতে চান। Exclamatory থেকে interrogative-এ রূপান্তর করতে proper auxiliary and subject-verb inversion প্রয়োগ করতে হবে। Comparative রূপে তুলনা করার জন্য comparative adjective + 'than' ব্যবহৃত হয়।

গ. প্যাসিভ বাক্য (c) কে অ্যাকটিভ করে লেখো।
ঘ. বাক্য (e) এর comparative অংশটি ব্যাখ্যা করো কেন এটি comparative এবং একটি সমতুল্য positive বাক্যও দাও।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: (a) The bell had rung every hour since dawn.  কারণ: এখানে 'had rung' হচ্ছে past perfect tense; এটি দেখায় কোন ক্রিয়া অতীতে নির্দিষ্ট পূর্ববর্তী সময়ে সম্পন্ন হয়ে গেছে — bell-এর ঘণ্টা প্রতিটি ঘন্টায় বাজানো হয় এবং সেই ক্রিয়াটি 'since dawn' থেকে অব্যাহত/সম্পন্ন ছিল, তাই perfect tense ব্যাখ্যা করে যে কাজটি পূর্বে সম্পন্ন হয়েছে।

খ উত্তর: Simple version of (b): People looked up at the heavy clouds.  কারণ: মূল compound বাক্যটি সম্ভবত 'People paused and looked up at the heavy clouds' (two verbs joined by 'and') — সরল ও সংক্ষিপ্ত করতে আমরা কেবল একটি action বেছে নিয়েছি: 'looked up'.

গ উত্তর: Active form of (c): An old man sat by the foot of the tower.  অথবা: People saw an old man sitting by the foot of the tower.  কারণ: মূল passive ছিল 'An old man was seen sitting by the foot of the tower.' Passive-কে active-তে রূপান্তর করতে agent যোগ করা হলে দ্বিতীয় রূপটি উপযুক্ত: 'People saw an old man sitting...' আর সরাসরি passive থেকে simple active description করতে চাইলে 'An old man sat...' ব্যবহার করা যায়।

ঘ উত্তর: (e) The sound was louder than any other noise in the street.  কারণ: এখানে 'louder' একটি comparative adjective — এটি দুই বা ততোধিক জিনিসের মধ্যে একটি তুলনা নির্দেশ করে (sound vs. other noises). Positive (non-comparative) equivalent: The sound was loud.  কারণ: positive বাক্যে কেবল একটি গুণের অস্তিত্ব বলা হয় (sound was loud) যখন comparative-এ তুলনা করা হয় (louder than ...)।

Explanation:
উপরের প্রতিটির ব্যাখ্যায় আমরা বিভিন্ন টেন্স, বাক্যগঠন ও রূপান্তরের বিষয়গুলো দেখিয়েছি। Past perfect ('had' + past participle) অতীতে এক ক্রিয়ার পূর্ববর্তী অবস্থান বা সম্পন্নতা বোঝায়। Compound বাক্যে একাধিক ক্রিয়া বা clause থাকতে পারে; তাদের থেকে একটি বেছে নিয়ে সরল করা যায়। Passive বাক্যকে active-তে রূপান্তরের সময় agent যোগ করলে বাক্যটি স্বাভাবিক active structure পায়। Comparative adjectives (louder, bigger, more beautiful) তুলনা বোঝায় এবং তাদের positive রূপ সাধারণ গুণবাচক বর্ণনা দেয়।

ঘ. প্রশ্ন (d) বাক্যটি interrogative (প্রশ্নবাচক) করে লিখুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "The parcel was brought into the reading room by the assistant."  
Explanation: মূল বাক্যটি—"The assistant brought the parcel into the reading room."—এখানে subject = the assistant, object = the parcel। Passive-এ object becomes subject এবং মূল subject-কে by-phrase দিয়ে প্রকাশ করা হয়। সময়টি simple past, তাই passive-এ "was brought" ব্যবহার করা হলো।

খ উত্তর: "The librarian admired the book's exquisite cover."  
Explanation: মূল বাক্যে একটি ফলবাচক (result) clause ছিল: "...so exquisite that the librarian could not refrain from opening it." অর্থ বজায় রেখে একটি single independent clause-এ পরিণত করতে আমরা সরলভাবে লেখেছি যে "the librarian admired the cover" — এটি একটি simple sentence (একটি স্বাধীন ক্লজ)।

গ উত্তর: "He removed a single illustration, and he began to examine it closely."  
Explanation: মূল বাক্যে দুটি স্বাধীন কাজ ছিল: "He removed a single illustration." এবং "He began to examine it closely." এগুলোকে comma + coordinating conjunction (and) ব্যবহার করে যোগ করলে compound sentence হয়। প্রতিটি অংশ স্বাধীন ক্লজ হওয়া উচিত; তাই subject (he) দ্বিতীয় ক্লজেও পূনরাবৃত্তি করা হয়েছে।

ঘ উত্তর: "When the owner returned, did he discover the missing illustration?"  
Explanation: Declarative বাক্যকে interrogative করতে auxiliary (do/does/did) ব্যবহার করা হয়। মূল বাক্যটি simple past হওয়ায় আমরা "did + subject + base verb" ব্যবহার করি: "did he discover"। সময়সূচক clause (When the owner returned) আগেই রেখে বাক্যটিকে প্রশ্নবাচক আকারে সাজানো হয়েছে।

Explanation:
এই প্রশ্নগুলিতে বাক্যের ভিন্ন ভিন্ন রূপান্তর শেখানো হয়েছে: passive voice-এ object কে subject বানানো হয় এবং উপযুক্ত auxiliary + past participle ব্যবহার করা হয়; simple sentence-এ একটি স্বাধীন ক্লজ বজায় রেখে অতিরিক্ত ফল বা অব্যাখ্য অংশ সরিয়ে সরল দাবি করা হয়; compound sentence তৈরিতে দুটি স্বাধীন ক্লজকে coordinating conjunction (e.g., and, but) দিয়ে যোগ করা হয়; interrogative গঠনে প্রয়োজনীয় auxiliary (do/does/did) উপযোগ করে subject–verb বিন্যাস পাল্টানো হয়। প্রতিটি রূপান্তরে কাল, কেড়ামি (tense/aspect) এবং অর্থের সামঞ্জস্য বজায় রাখা হয়েছে।

Question:
A baker had baked a large pie for the village festival. (a) The baker baked the pie before dawn. (b) The aroma of the pie tempted everyone. (c) He tasted one slice and wiped his mouth. (d) When the village elder came to eat, he noticed the missing slice.

Options:
ক. বাক্য (a)-টি passive voice-এ লিখুন।
খ. বাক্য (b)-টিকে negative sentence-এ রূপ করুন।
গ. বাক্য (c)-টিকে compound sentence-এ রূপান্তর করুন।
ঘ. বাক্য (d)-টিকে interrogative sentence-এ লিখুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "The pie was baked by the baker before dawn."  
Explanation: "The baker baked the pie before dawn."—এখানে object "the pie" passive-এর subject হয়ে উঠেছে। Simple past tense থাকার কারণে passive form হবে "was baked" এবং agent আকারে "by the baker" যোগ করা হয়েছে।

খ উত্তর: "The aroma of the pie did not tempt anyone."  
Explanation: মূল বাক্য "The aroma of the pie tempted everyone."—এটি affirmative। Negative করার জন্য আমরা auxiliary "did" ব্যবহার করে past tense-এর negation গঠন করি: "did not" + base verb (tempt)। ফলে বাক্যটি অভিব্যক্তি করে যে কেউ তাতে প্রলুব্ধ হয়নি।

গ উত্তর: "He tasted one slice, and he wiped his mouth."  
Explanation: প্রথমেই দুটি স্বাধীন ক্রিয়া ছিল—"He tasted one slice." এবং "He wiped his mouth."—এগুলোকে comma + "and" দিয়ে যুক্ত করে আমরা একটি compound sentence পেয়েছি। প্রতিটি অংশ স্বাধীন ক্লজ হওয়ায় subject (he) দ্বিতীয় ক্লজেও পুনরায় লেখা হয়েছে।

ঘ উত্তর: "Did the village elder notice the missing slice when he came to eat?"  
Explanation: প্রশ্নকরণে simple past এ "did + subject + base verb" ব্যবহার করা হয়; এখানে base verb = notice। সময়সূচক clause (when he came to eat) বাক্যের শেষে রেখে সাধারণ yes/no প্রশ্ন তৈরি করা হয়েছে।

Explanation:
এই সেটে passive, negative, compound এবং interrogative রূপান্তরের ব্যবহারিক কৌশল দেখানো হয়েছে। Passive গঠনের সময় object কে subject বানাতে হবে এবং tense অনুযায়ী appropriate form (is/was/were + past participle) নিতে হবে; negative গঠনে auxiliary (do/does/did) ও negation (not) ব্যবহার করা হয়; compound sentence-এ স্বাধীন ক্লজ যোগ করার জন্য coordinating conjunction (and, but, or) প্রয়োগ করা হয়; interrogative রূপে auxiliary-কে subject-এর আগে রাখি যেন প্রশ্নবোধক রূপ তৈরি হয়। প্রতিটি ক্ষেত্রে tense ও অর্থের সামঞ্জস্য বজায় রাখা জরুরি।

Question:
A farmer finished harvesting and tied a bundle of wheat. (a) The farmer harvested the wheat by hand. (b) The bundle seemed heavy and tempting. (c) He took one stalk home for his child to play with. (d) In the evening his wife realised the stalk was missing.

Options:
ক. বাক্য (a)-টি passive করে লিখুন।
খ. বাক্য (b)-টি অর্থ বজায় রেখে একটি simple sentence-এ রচনা করুন।
গ. বাক্য (c)-কে negative sentence-এ রূপ করুন।
ঘ. বাক্য (d)-টিকে compound sentence-এ পরিণত করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "The wheat was harvested by the farmer with his own hands."  
Explanation: active বাক্যটি passive-এ করা হলে object "the wheat" passive subject হয়। "by the farmer" agent বোঝায় এবং "by hand"-এর পরিবর্তে প্রাঞ্জল করে "with his own hands" যোগ করা হলো; tense হলো simple past, তাই "was harvested" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।

খ উত্তর: "The bundle looked heavy."  
Explanation: মূল বাক্যটি ছিল "The bundle seemed heavy and tempting." যাতে দুইটি descriptive element আছে। একটি পরিষ্কার simple sentence পেতে আমরা একটিবিষয় (heavy) ধরে নিই: "The bundle looked heavy." — এটি একটি single independent clause, অর্থ সহজে বোঝায়। (প্রয়োজনে "tempting" রাখলে বাক্যটি compound/complex হতে পারে।)

গ উত্তর: "He did not take any stalk home for his child to play with."  
Explanation: মূল affirmative বাক্যকে negative-এ রূপান্তর করার জন্য simple past tense-এ "did not" + base verb ব্যবহার করা হয়: did not + take। "Any" ব্যবহার করে নেগেটিভ প্রেক্ষিতে অনির্দিষ্ট পরিমাপ চিহ্নিত করা হয়েছে।

ঘ উত্তর: "In the evening his wife came home, and she realised the stalk was missing."  
Explanation: মূল বাক্যটি single clause ছিল। একটি compound sentence তৈরি করতে আমরা দুটি স্বাধীন ক্লজ দিয়েছি—(1) "his wife came home" এবং (2) "she realised the stalk was missing"—আর এগুলোকে coordinating conjunction "and" দিয়ে যোগ করা হলো। প্রতিটি ক্লজ স্বাধীন হওয়ায় subject দ্বিতীয় ক্লজেও রাখা হয়েছে।

Explanation:
এই উদাহরণগুলোতে passive voice, simple sentence গঠন, negation ও compound sentence তৈরির মূল নীতি প্রয়োগ করা হয়েছে। passive-এ object কে নতুন subject করে tense অনুযায়ী is/are/was/were + past participle ব্যবহার করতে হয়; simple sentence-এ একটি স্বাধীন ক্লজ রেখে বাক্য সরল করা হয়; negative গঠনে appropriate auxiliary (did not) ব্যবহার করে verb-এর base form রাখতে হয়; compound sentence তৈরিতে দুইটি স্বাধীন ক্লজকে coordinating conjunction দিয়ে যুক্ত করা হয়। প্রতিটি রূপান্তরে বাক্যের মূল অর্থ ও কাল বজায় রাখার চেষ্টা করা হয়েছে।

Question:
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world and a habitat for diverse wildlife. Read the sentences below and perform the transformations indicated in parentheses.

Options:
ক. The Sundarbans is home to the Royal Bengal Tiger. (negative)
খ. Many tourists visit the Sundarbans to observe wildlife. (interrogative)
গ. Local guides lead visitors through the forest. (passive)
ঘ. Those who visit the Sundarbans for eco-tourism often return amazed by its scenery. (simple)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: The Sundarbans is not home to the Royal Bengal Tiger.

খ উত্তর: Do many tourists visit the Sundarbans to observe wildlife?

গ উত্তর: Visitors are led through the forest by local guides.

ঘ উত্তর: Visitors to the Sundarbans for eco-tourism often return amazed.

Explanation:
ক: To change a positive statement into a negative one, insert 'not' after the auxiliary verb ('is'). Thus 'is home' becomes 'is not home'.

খ: To form a yes/no question in the present simple with 'many tourists' (plural), use the auxiliary 'do' + subject + base verb: 'Do many tourists visit...?' If the sentence named the Sundarbans explicitly in the question, it remains clear.

গ: To convert an active sentence to passive, make the object of the active sentence the subject of the passive sentence. 'Local guides (subject) lead visitors (object) through the forest' becomes 'Visitors are led through the forest by local guides.' Note the auxiliary 'are' + past participle 'led'.

ঘ: A simple sentence has a single independent clause (one subject and one predicate). The complex relative clause 'Those who visit the Sundarbans for eco-tourism' can be converted to a simple noun phrase 'Visitors to the Sundarbans for eco-tourism' with a single predicate 'often return amazed,' producing a simple sentence: 'Visitors to the Sundarbans for eco-tourism often return amazed.'

Question:
Srimangal is famous for its rolling tea gardens, tranquil atmosphere and rich biodiversity. Transform the following sentences as instructed.

Options:
ক. Srimangal has rolling tea gardens and many peaceful resorts. (complex)
খ. Farmers pick tea leaves early in the morning. (passive)
গ. Visitors enjoy the fresh air and the songs of birds. (negative)
ঘ. Many photographers come to capture the green landscape. (interrogative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: Srimangal, which has rolling tea gardens, also offers many peaceful resorts.

খ উত্তর: Tea leaves are picked early in the morning by farmers.

গ উত্তর: Visitors do not enjoy the fresh air and the songs of birds.

ঘ উত্তর: Do many photographers come to capture the green landscape?

Explanation:
ক: To change a simple/compound sentence into a complex sentence, introduce a relative clause or subordinate clause. Here we add a relative clause 'which has rolling tea gardens' to make it complex: 'Srimangal, which has rolling tea gardens, also offers many peaceful resorts.'

খ: Passive voice is formed by making the object the subject and using a form of 'be' + past participle. 'Farmers pick tea leaves' → 'Tea leaves are picked ... by farmers.' The time phrase 'early in the morning' stays in its position.

গ: To make the sentence negative in the present simple, use 'do/does not' + base verb. For plural subject 'Visitors' use 'do not': 'Visitors do not enjoy...'. (Note: the negative changes the meaning but is grammatically correct for the exercise.)

ঘ: Form a yes/no question with 'do' for the present simple: 'Do many photographers come to capture the green landscape?' The auxiliary 'do' precedes the subject 'many photographers'.

Options:
ক. Locals sell fresh fish and handicrafts to visitors. (passive)
খ. People visit Saint Martin's Island to see the coral beaches. (emphatic/cleft)
গ. The sea is calm and the beaches are clean. (simple)
ঘ. Tourists can swim in the clear waters. (interrogative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: Fresh fish and handicrafts are sold to visitors by locals.

খ উত্তর: It is to see the coral beaches that people visit Saint Martin's Island.

গ উত্তর: The island has calm seas and clean beaches.

ঘ উত্তর: Can tourists swim in the clear waters?

Explanation:
ক: Convert active to passive by making the object the subject and using appropriate 'be' + past participle: 'Locals sell fresh fish and handicrafts to visitors' → 'Fresh fish and handicrafts are sold to visitors by locals.'

খ: An emphatic (cleft) sentence highlights a particular part by using the structure 'It is ... that ...'. To emphasize the purpose, transform 'People visit Saint Martin's Island to see the coral beaches' into 'It is to see the coral beaches that people visit Saint Martin's Island.'

গ: To make a single simple sentence from a compound description, introduce one subject that holds both qualities: 'The island has calm seas and clean beaches.' This yields a simple sentence with one subject ('The island') and a compound object/predicate.

ঘ: To form an interrogative (yes/no) in present ability, invert the modal 'can' and the subject: 'Can tourists swim in the clear waters?'

Question:
About the ant: Ants live in colonies, carry food to their nests and store it carefully for lean times.

Options:
ক. Very few animals can carry objects many times their own weight. (Make it comparative)
খ. It lives in a colony. (Make it negative)
গ. It searches for food and brings it to the nest. (Make it compound)
ঘ. The colony stores the food in chambers. (Make it passive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক An ant is stronger than most other animals in proportion to its size.
খ It does not live alone.
গ It searches for food, and it brings it to the nest.
ঘ The food is stored in chambers by the colony.

Explanation:
ক: To make a comparative sentence we compare the ant's strength with that of other animals. We use a comparative phrase ('stronger than most other animals') and add 'in proportion to its size' to preserve the original idea about carrying weight relative to body size. খ: Converting an affirmative simple present sentence to negative requires the auxiliary 'does' for third-person singular plus 'not': 'does not live'. 'It does not live alone' preserves meaning and uses a natural negative contrast. গ: A compound sentence joins two independent actions. We join the two clauses with a coordinating conjunction: 'It searches for food, and it brings it to the nest.' Note the comma before 'and' connects the two related actions. ঘ: To convert active to passive, the object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive. 'The colony stores the food in chambers' (active) → 'The food is stored in chambers by the colony' (passive). The verb changes to the appropriate passive form ('is stored').

Options:
ক. Few insects are as colourful as the butterfly. (Make it comparative)
খ. It dries its wings in the sun. (Make it negative)
গ. It alights on petals; then it drinks nectar. (Make it compound)
ঘ. When it finds a suitable flower, it unfurls its proboscis and feeds. (Make it complex)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A butterfly is more colourful than most other insects.
খ It does not dry its wings in the shade.
গ It alights on petals and then drinks nectar.
ঘ Whenever it finds a suitable flower, it unfurls its proboscis and feeds.

Explanation:
ক: To form a comparative from 'Few insects are as colourful as the butterfly', we restate the idea by comparing the butterfly with others: 'A butterfly is more colourful than most other insects.' খ: The instruction 'Make it negative' requires switching to a negative form. One natural negative contrast is 'It does not dry its wings in the shade,' which contrasts sun vs shade and uses the auxiliary 'does not'. (Alternatively, a direct negative of the original is 'It does not dry its wings in the sun' — either is grammatically acceptable depending on intended contrast.) গ: Turning two related actions into a compound sentence uses a coordinating conjunction: 'It alights on petals and then drinks nectar.' Adding 'then' clarifies sequence. ঘ: To make a complex sentence we use a subordinating conjunction to show dependence: 'Whenever it finds a suitable flower' is the subordinate clause, followed by the main clause 'it unfurls its proboscis and feeds.' This preserves time/condition relation.

Question:
About the squirrel: Squirrels gather nuts in autumn and hide them to eat when food is scarce.

Options:
ক. Very few small creatures are as clever at hoarding as the squirrel. (Make it comparative)
খ. It buries nuts under leaves. (Make it negative)
গ. It gathers nuts and hides them in different places. (Make it compound)
ঘ. The stored nuts are eaten by the squirrel in winter. (Make it active)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A squirrel is more clever at hoarding than most other small creatures.
খ It does not bury nuts on the surface.
গ It gathers nuts, and it hides them in different places.
ঘ The squirrel eats the stored nuts in winter.

Explanation:
ক: To convert 'Very few small creatures are as clever at hoarding as the squirrel' into a comparative form we assert the squirrel's superiority: 'A squirrel is more clever at hoarding than most other small creatures.' 'More clever' (or 'cleverer') expresses the comparative, and 'than most other small creatures' gives the comparison group. খ: Making the affirmative sentence negative uses the auxiliary 'does not' for third-person singular: 'It does not bury nuts on the surface.' This provides a clear negative contrast to the affirmative habit. (Alternatively, a direct negative of 'under leaves' would be 'It does not bury nuts under leaves,' but the chosen negative gives a natural contrast relevant to hiding behaviour.) গ: A compound sentence connecting two related independent actions uses a coordinating conjunction and often a comma: 'It gathers nuts, and it hides them in different places.' This keeps both actions as independent clauses joined together. ঘ: To change passive to active, make the agent the grammatical subject and convert the verb to active voice: 'The stored nuts are eaten by the squirrel' (passive) → 'The squirrel eats the stored nuts in winter' (active). The verb changes to 'eats' and the original agent 'the squirrel' becomes the subject.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Different dynasties built the Great Wall over many centuries.

খ It stretches thousands of kilometers, and people can see it from high vantage points and along river valleys.

ঘ Because survey teams measured the route carefully, the wall follows the natural contours of the land.

Explanation:
ক: সরল বাক্য হলে একক স্বাধীন অনুচ্ছেদ থাকবে; তাই ক্রিয়াকর্তা (different dynasties) সামনে রেখে বাক্যটিকে সরল করা হয়েছে।

খ: সমযোজক বা সংযুক্ত বাক্যের জন্য দুটি স্বাধীন ধারা কে সংশিষ্ট সংযোজক (and) দ্বারা মিলিয়ে একটি সমবায় বাক্য তৈরি করা হয়েছে: প্রথম ধারা — 'It stretches ...' এবং দ্বিতীয় ধারা — 'people can see it...'.

ঘ: জটিল বাক্যের জন্য একটি উপধারা (subordinate clause) প্রয়োজন — এখানে 'Because survey teams measured the route carefully' (কারণ) — এবং মূলধারা হিসেবে ফলাফল রাখা হয়েছে: 'the wall follows the natural contours of the land.' এইভাবে কারণ-ফল কাঠামোতে জটিল বাক্য তৈরি হয়।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The statue was given to the United States by France in 1886 as a present.

খ Tourists admire the figure every year.

গ It greeted many new arrivals, and it became an emblem of hope for immigrants.

ঘ Because the outer copper sheets reacted with the air, a green patina formed over time.

Explanation:
ক: Active বাক্যকে passive করতে 'the statue' কে বিষয় বানিয়ে ক্রিয়া passive ফর্মে ('was given') করা হয়েছে এবং কর্তা ('by France') শেষ বা উপযুক্ত স্থানে রাখতে হবে।

খ: সরল বাক্য বলতে একটি স্বাধীন ধারা নিশ্চিত করতে হবে; তাই মূল অর্থ বজায় রেখে বাক্যটি সংক্ষিপ্ত করা হয়েছে — 'Tourists admire the figure every year.' (ফটো তোলার অংশটি বাদ দিয়ে বাক্যটি এক অনুচ্ছেদে আনা হয়েছে)।

গ: সমযোজক বাক্যের জন্য দুটি স্বাধীন ধারা কে coordinating conjunction ('and') দ্বারা যুক্ত করা হয়েছে: 'It greeted many new arrivals' এবং 'it became an emblem...' — ফলে সমবায় কাঠামো তৈরি হয়।

ঘ: জটিল বাক্যে causa/result সম্পর্ক দেখাতে 'Because' ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে: উপধারা (cause) — 'Because the outer copper sheets reacted with the air' এবং মূলধারা (result) — 'a green patina formed over time.'

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Hiram Bingham rediscovered the site in 1911.

খ The terraced fields allowed farmers to cultivate steep slopes, and they helped prevent erosion.

গ Machu Picchu is visited by many scholars and tourists to study ancient Incan construction techniques.

ঘ Because Machu Picchu lies at a high altitude, visitors often need time to acclimatize before hiking.

Explanation:
ক: সরল বাক্য তৈরি করার সময় বাক্যকে একটি একক স্বাধীন ধারায় সীমাবদ্ধ রাখা হয়; অতিরিক্ত বিবরণ কেটে দিয়ে মূল ঘটনার (rediscovery in 1911) ওপর জোর দেওয়া হয়েছে।

Question:
It was a chilly winter morning. (a) A playful monkey swung from branch to branch. (simple) (b) Because the stream was frozen, the deer could not drink. (complex) (c) The hunters were seen by the villagers. (passive) (d) Aren't the snow-capped hills beautiful? (interrogative)

Options:
ক. A playful monkey swung from branch to branch. (simple)
খ. Because the stream was frozen, the deer could not drink. (complex)
গ. The hunters were seen by the villagers. (passive)
ঘ. Aren't the snow-capped hills beautiful? (interrogative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: Simple sentence — "A playful monkey swung from branch to branch." is a single independent clause with a subject (A playful monkey) and a predicate (swung from branch to branch). It expresses one complete thought.
খ উত্তর: Complex sentence — "Because the stream was frozen, the deer could not drink." contains a dependent (subordinate) clause "Because the stream was frozen" and an independent clause "the deer could not drink." The presence of a subordinating conjunction (Because) makes it a complex sentence.
গ উত্তর: Passive voice — "The hunters were seen by the villagers." is in passive voice because the subject (The hunters) receives the action. The agent performing the action is introduced by "by the villagers." Active form: "The villagers saw the hunters." 
ঘ উত্তর: Interrogative sentence — "Aren't the snow-capped hills beautiful?" is a question (it asks for confirmation) and is therefore interrogative. Its structure (auxiliary verb before the subject) marks it as a question.

Explanation:
ক: A simple sentence has one independent clause and no subordinate clauses. Here there is only one subject–predicate unit, so it is simple. খ: A complex sentence contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause introduced by subordinators like because, although, since, etc. The clause beginning with "Because" cannot stand alone, so the sentence is complex. গ: Passive voice is identified when the grammatical subject is the receiver of the action and the doer (agent) may appear in a "by"-phrase. Converting to active voice (Villagers saw the hunters) confirms the passive form. ঘ: Interrogative sentences ask questions; inversion of auxiliary and subject (Aren't + the snow-capped hills) signals a question form. Each identification follows these standard grammatical criteria.

Question:
Near a quiet village there stood an old well. (a) The old oak is taller than the cottage. (comparative) (b) He repaired the fence, and then he planted seedlings. (compound) (c) The letters were delivered by the postman. (passive) (d) What a delightful harvest this year! (exclamatory)

Options:
ক. The old oak is taller than the cottage. (comparative)
খ. He repaired the fence, and then he planted seedlings. (compound)
গ. The letters were delivered by the postman. (passive)
ঘ. What a delightful harvest this year! (exclamatory)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: Comparative — "The old oak is taller than the cottage." compares two things (the oak and the cottage) using the comparative adjective "taller" and the word "than."
খ উত্তর: Compound sentence — "He repaired the fence, and then he planted seedlings." contains two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "and" (with an adverbial sequence "then"), so it is a compound sentence.
গ উত্তর: Passive voice — "The letters were delivered by the postman." is passive because the subject (The letters) receives the action; the agent is "by the postman." Active form: "The postman delivered the letters." 
ঘ উত্তর: Exclamatory sentence — "What a delightful harvest this year!" expresses strong feeling or emotion (surprise or delight) about the harvest and is thus exclamatory. It uses an exclamatory structure starting with "What."

Explanation:
ক: Comparative adjectives compare two nouns; look for words like 'taller', 'more beautiful', followed by 'than' to identify comparative structures. খ: Compound sentences are formed by joining two independent clauses with coordinating conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). Each clause could stand alone as a sentence. গ: Passive voice is recognizable when the subject is acted upon rather than doing the action; often formed with a form of "be" + past participle and optionally a "by"-phrase indicating the agent. ঘ: Exclamatory sentences convey strong emotion and often begin with "What" or "How" followed by an exclamatory tone; punctuation (!) also signals exclamation.

Question:
A young artist painted a bright mural in the town square. (a) The child laughed. (simple) (b) She opened the window but the rain started pouring. (compound) (c) Although he practiced daily, he could not master the piece. (complex) (d) Close the door, please. (imperative)

Options:
ক. The child laughed. (simple)
খ. She opened the window but the rain started pouring. (compound)
গ. Although he practiced daily, he could not master the piece. (complex)
ঘ. Close the door, please. (imperative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: Simple sentence — "The child laughed." is a single independent clause with a subject and a verb; it expresses one complete idea.
খ উত্তর: Compound sentence — "She opened the window but the rain started pouring." has two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "but," so it is compound. Each clause can stand alone: "She opened the window." / "The rain started pouring."
গ উত্তর: Complex sentence — "Although he practiced daily, he could not master the piece." contains a subordinate clause beginning with "Although" that depends on the main clause "he could not master the piece." This subordinate+main clause structure makes it complex.
ঘ উত্তর: Imperative sentence — "Close the door, please." issues a command/request and the subject 'you' is implied, which is characteristic of imperative sentences. The polite "please" does not change the sentence type.

Explanation:
ক: Simple sentences have one subject–predicate unit and no subordinate clauses. খ: Compound sentences are formed when two independent clauses are joined by coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, etc.). Check that each part could be a sentence on its own. গ: Complex sentences include at least one dependent (subordinate) clause introduced by subordinating conjunctions such as although, because, when, etc., plus an independent clause. ঘ: Imperative sentences give orders, requests, or instructions; they usually have an implied subject (you) and often begin with the base form of a verb. The presence of 'please' only affects tone, not sentence type.

Question:
Read the following about ants and perform the requested transformations of the given sentences.

Options:
ক. (a) An ant is small yet very strong. (make it comparative)
খ. (b) It lives together with other ants. (make it negative)
গ. (c) It finds crumbs, carries them, and stores them. (make it simple)
ঘ. (d) The workers feed the larvae. (make it passive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক An ant is smaller yet stronger than many other insects. খ It does not live alone. গ It finds and stores crumbs. ঘ The larvae are fed by the workers.

Explanation:
ক: To make the sentence comparative we compare the ant with other insects. Adjectives 'small' and 'strong' become comparative with 'smaller' and 'stronger' and a comparison phrase ('than many other insects') is added for clarity. Example: 'An ant is smaller yet stronger than many other insects.'

খ: The original 'It lives together with other ants' expresses a collective habit. The negative counterpart that conveys the opposite idea concisely is 'It does not live alone.' This uses the auxiliary 'does' + 'not' for present simple negative and replaces 'together with other ants' by the antonym 'alone' for a natural negative sentence.

গ: The original is a compound series of actions ('finds crumbs, carries them, and stores them'). To make it a simpler, more compact sentence we combine related actions into a simple coordinated structure: 'It finds and stores crumbs.' (You can also say 'It finds, carries and stores crumbs.' but the requirement asked to simplify, so combining chores into a concise simple sentence is appropriate.)

ঘ: To change to passive voice, make the object 'the larvae' the subject and use the appropriate form of 'be' + past participle: 'The larvae are fed by the workers.' Present simple passive is used because the active sentence 'The workers feed the larvae' is in present simple.

Question:
Read the following about squirrels and perform the requested grammatical changes.

Options:
ক. (a) A squirrel is agile and quick. (make it comparative)
খ. (b) It hides nuts under the leaves. (make it negative)
গ. (c) It jumps from branch to branch searching for food. (make it simple)
ঘ. (d) The children watched the squirrel store nuts. (make it passive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A squirrel is more agile and quicker than many other small mammals. খ It does not hide nuts under the leaves. গ It jumps between branches to look for food. ঘ The squirrel was watched storing nuts by the children.

Explanation:
ক: To form the comparative from two adjectives, we use 'more' with longer adjectives or the '-er' form with short ones. 'Agile' becomes 'more agile' and 'quick' becomes 'quicker'. We add a comparison phrase: 'than many other small mammals.'

খ: To make the present simple sentence negative, we add the auxiliary 'does' + 'not' before the base verb: 'It does not hide nuts under the leaves.' This directly negates the original action in the same tense.

গ: The original sentence is somewhat descriptive with a participle phrase ('searching for food'). To make it simpler, we state the two main actions in a compact simple sentence: 'It jumps between branches to look for food.' This keeps the meaning but reduces the clause complexity.

ঘ: Turning the active sentence 'The children watched the squirrel store nuts' into passive requires making 'the squirrel' the subject and using 'be' + past participle. The event is in the past, so 'was' is used: 'The squirrel was watched storing nuts by the children.' Alternatively, 'The squirrel was watched by the children storing nuts' may be used, but the given form keeps the progressive activity clear.

Question:
Read the short passage about sparrows and carry out the requested sentence transformations.

Options:
ক. (a) A sparrow is small and active. (make it comparative)
খ. (b) It often sings in the morning. (make it negative)
গ. (c) Flocks fly across the sky searching for grain and perch on wires. (make it simple)
ঘ. (d) People feed sparrows in winter. (make it passive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A sparrow is smaller and more active than many city birds. খ It does not often sing at night. গ Flocks fly across the sky looking for grain. ঘ Sparrows are fed by people in winter.

Explanation:
ক: To make a comparative statement we convert 'small' to 'smaller' and 'active' to 'more active' (since 'active' typically takes 'more' in comparative). We add a comparison target: 'than many city birds.'

খ: Negating 'It often sings in the morning' can be done by turning it into a natural negative statement. One clear negation that contrasts time is 'It does not often sing at night.' If a direct negation of the original sentence is required while keeping the same time reference, you could say 'It does not often sing in the morning.' Both are correct negations; the first offers a natural opposite meaning.

গ: The original sentence contains two linked activities ('searching for grain' and 'perch on wires'). To simplify, we focus on the main action and purpose: 'Flocks fly across the sky looking for grain.' This reduces compound structure while retaining the core idea.

ঘ: To convert the active present simple 'People feed sparrows in winter' into passive, make 'sparrows' the subject and use 'are' + past participle: 'Sparrows are fed by people in winter.' This preserves tense and meaning in passive voice.

Question:
Counterfeit medicines are a growing public health threat. (a) Some manufacturers mix cheaper substances into genuine tablets, endangering patients. (Make it passive) (b) The potency of many drugs has been reduced by such adulteration. (Make it active) (c) Regulatory agencies inspect pharmacies, but they are unable to examine every shipment. (Make it complex) (d) The circulation of fake medicines is rising and people suffer. (Make it compound)

Options:
ক. Make sentence (a) passive.
খ. Make sentence (b) active.
গ. Make sentence (c) complex.
ঘ. Make sentence (d) compound.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Cheaper substances are mixed into genuine tablets by some manufacturers, endangering patients.

খ Such adulteration has reduced the potency of many drugs.

গ Although regulatory agencies inspect pharmacies, they are unable to examine every shipment.

ঘ The circulation of fake medicines is rising, and people are suffering.

Explanation:
ক (Passive): To form the passive, move the object to the subject position and use the appropriate form of "be" + past participle; the original agent can be added with "by". Here "cheaper substances" (object) becomes the subject, "are mixed" is the passive verb, and "by some manufacturers" indicates the agent.

খ (Active): Convert the passive "The potency . . . has been reduced by such adulteration" into active voice by making the agent the subject: "Such adulteration has reduced the potency..." Keep tense and meaning the same (present perfect).

গ (Complex): A complex sentence contains an independent clause and at least one dependent clause. Joining the two independent ideas with a subordinating conjunction (e.g., "although") creates a complex sentence: "Although regulatory agencies inspect pharmacies" (dependent) + "they are unable..." (independent).

ঘ (Compound): A compound sentence joins two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). Here use "and" to link two related independent clauses: "The circulation... is rising, and people are suffering."

Question:
Plastic pollution threatens marine ecosystems. (a) Thousands of tons of plastic are dumped into the oceans every year by coastal cities. (Make it active) (b) This plastic chokes marine life and damages habitats. (Make it passive) (c) It is mandatory for some manufacturers to reduce single-use packaging. (Make it compound) (d) Communities organize beach clean-ups, and volunteers collect debris. (Make it complex)

Options:
ক. Make sentence (a) active.
খ. Make sentence (b) passive.
গ. Make sentence (c) compound.
ঘ. Make sentence (d) complex.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Coastal cities dump thousands of tons of plastic into the oceans every year.

খ Marine life is choked and habitats are damaged by this plastic.

গ It is mandatory for some manufacturers to reduce single-use packaging, and governments must enforce the regulations.

ঘ Because communities organize beach clean-ups, volunteers are able to collect debris effectively.

Explanation:
ক (Active): Convert from passive to active by making the agent the subject: "Coastal cities" + verb "dump" + object "thousands of tons of plastic...". Maintain the original time expression.

খ (Passive): To make an active clause passive, promote the object to subject position and use "be" + past participle. The compound predicate "chokes" and "damages" becomes two passive clauses: "is choked" and "are damaged" (match number with nouns). Here "marine life" (singular/collective) takes "is choked" and "habitats" takes "are damaged", or combine with plural verbs as done.

গ (Compound): Add a coordinating conjunction and a second independent clause to form a compound sentence. The added clause should be logically connected (e.g., enforcement by governments).

ঘ (Complex): Replace the coordinating link with a subordinating conjunction (e.g., "because", "since", "when") to make one clause dependent: "Because communities organize beach clean-ups" (dependent) + "volunteers are able to collect debris effectively" (independent).

খ. Make sentence (b) passive.
গ. Make sentence (c) simple.
ঘ. Make sentence (d) compound.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Environmental scientists discovered lead contamination in several neighborhood wells.

খ Waterborne diseases are spread among children by poor sanitation.

গ Many households cannot afford filtration systems.

ঘ Public awareness campaigns can reduce the risk, and community clinics can treat those who fall ill.

Explanation:
ক (Active): Move the agent "environmental scientists" into subject position and use the active verb "discovered". This preserves meaning and tense.

খ (Passive): Promote the object "waterborne diseases" to subject position and form passive with "are" + past participle "spread"; add the original agent with "by" if desired: "by poor sanitation."

গ (Simple): Remove the subordinating conjunction and the dependent clause to leave a single independent clause expressing the main idea: "Many households cannot afford filtration systems." This keeps the core meaning.

ঘ (Compound): Join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction to form a compound sentence. An added independent clause should relate to the first—here, linking prevention (campaigns) with treatment (clinics) shows a fuller response to the problem.

Question:
An ant carries heavy loads. It lives in colonies. It works throughout the day. It transports food to its larvae.

Options:
ক. Make the first sentence comparative
খ. Make the second sentence negative
গ. Make a compound sentence from the third and fourth sentences
ঘ. Change the fourth sentence into passive voice


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক An ant carries heavier loads than most other insects.
খ It does not live alone.
গ It works throughout the day and transports food to its larvae.
ঘ Food is transported to the larvae by the ant.

Explanation:
ক: To form a comparative, we compare the ant with other insects and use the comparative adjective 'heavier' followed by 'than most other insects' to show comparison.

খ: To make the sentence negative we replace the affirmative 'It lives in colonies' with a negation that preserves meaning: 'It does not live alone.' The auxiliary 'does' + 'not' is used for present simple negation.

গ: To create a compound sentence we join two related independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction 'and': 'It works throughout the day and transports food to its larvae.' This keeps both actions performed by the ant in one sentence.

ঘ: To change into passive voice, make the object 'food' the subject of the sentence: 'Food is transported to the larvae by the ant.' Use appropriate tense (present simple passive: 'is transported') and include the agent with 'by the ant.'

Options:
ক. Combine the first two sentences into a complex sentence
খ. Make the third sentence negative
গ. Make a compound sentence joining the third and fourth sentences with 'but'

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Although a sparrow is a small bird, it builds its nest in trees.
খ It does not sing sweetly every morning.
গ It sings sweetly every morning but shelters its young from rain.
ঘ Its nest is built in trees by the sparrow.

Explanation:
ক: A complex sentence uses a subordinating conjunction to join a dependent clause and an independent clause. 'Although' introduces the concession ('Although a sparrow is a small bird'), followed by the main clause ('it builds its nest in trees').

খ: To negate the present simple sentence 'It sings sweetly every morning', use the auxiliary 'does' + 'not' plus the base verb: 'It does not sing sweetly every morning.'

গ: To form a compound sentence joining two related actions, use the coordinating conjunction 'but' to contrast or simply join: 'It sings sweetly every morning but shelters its young from rain.'

ঘ: To make the second sentence passive, promote the object 'its nest' to subject position and use passive verb form: 'Its nest is built in trees by the sparrow.' ('is built' = present simple passive)

খ. Turn 'It catches insects in the web.' into an interrogative sentence
গ. Make a compound sentence from the first two sentences using 'so'
ঘ. Change 'A spider weaves an intricate web.' into passive voice


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক It is more patient than many other predators.
খ Does it catch insects in the web?
গ A spider weaves an intricate web, so it waits patiently for prey.
ঘ An intricate web is woven by a spider.

Explanation:
ক: To make a comparative from 'It waits patiently for prey', we compare its patience with others: 'It is more patient than many other predators.' Use 'more' + adjective to form comparative for polysyllabic adjectives.

খ: To form an interrogative in present simple, invert the auxiliary 'does' and the subject: 'Does it catch insects in the web?' Note that the main verb returns to base form 'catch.'

গ: To show cause and effect or sequence between the spider's weaving and waiting, join the clauses with 'so': 'A spider weaves an intricate web, so it waits patiently for prey.' This implies the web allows it to wait for prey.

ঘ: To change to passive, make 'an intricate web' the subject and use passive construction: 'An intricate web is woven by a spider.' Use 'is woven' for present simple passive and include the agent 'by a spider.'

Question:
Anita lives in a small studio in Vancouver. (a) Anita lives in a small studio in Vancouver. (b) Her husband Raj enjoys cooking delicious meals. (c) Vancouver is not often sunny. (d) Their neighbors sometimes knock late at night. (e) They like to host friends who visit from other provinces.

Options:
ক. Rewrite sentence (a) as a complex sentence.
খ. Rewrite sentence (b) as a negative sentence.
গ. Rewrite sentence (c) as a positive (affirmative) sentence.
ঘ. Rewrite sentence (d) as an interrogative sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Anita lives in a small studio in Vancouver, where she finds it convenient to be close to her workplace. — This is a complex sentence: the main clause "Anita lives in a small studio in Vancouver" is combined with a subordinate relative clause "where she finds it convenient to be close to her workplace." 

খ Her husband Raj does not enjoy cooking delicious meals. — Negative form: the auxiliary "does" + "not" is used with the base verb "enjoy" to make the sentence negative (does not enjoy). 

গ Vancouver often has cloudy and rainy weather. — Positive/affirmative form: converts the negative idea "is not often sunny" into an affirmative statement that expresses the same meaning (i.e., frequent cloudy/rainy conditions). 

ঘ Do their neighbors sometimes knock late at night? — Interrogative form: use the auxiliary verb "do" for the present simple, place it before the subject, and keep the main verb in base form to form a yes/no question.

Explanation:
For each transformation we applied standard English sentence-formation rules:
- Complex sentence: add a subordinate clause (e.g., relative clause "where...") or a dependent clause joined to the main clause.
- Negative sentence: insert the appropriate auxiliary (do/does/did) + "not" with the base form of the main verb for simple tenses; keep subject-verb agreement ("does not enjoy" for "Raj").
- Positive/Affirmative: convert negative phrasing into an affirmative statement that preserves meaning ("not often sunny" → "often cloudy and rainy").
- Interrogative: form a question by moving the auxiliary before the subject ("Do their neighbors...") and keeping the main verb in base form.
Each transformed sentence preserves the original meaning while following grammatical rules for the requested sentence type.

ক. Rewrite sentence (a) in the passive voice.
খ. Rewrite sentence (b) as a negative sentence.
গ. Rewrite sentence (c) as an interrogative sentence.
ঘ. Rewrite sentence (d) as a compound sentence by adding a related clause.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A busy museum in Madrid is worked at by Carlos. (More natural passive: Carlos is employed at a busy museum in Madrid. / The museum in Madrid is where Carlos works.) — Passive form: make the object of the active sentence the subject of the passive. Note: for verbs like "work" the passive can sound awkward; often we recast into a more natural passive or prefer an active paraphrase.

খ His sister Elena does not collect antique postcards. — Negative form: insert "does not" before the base verb "collect" (subject "Elena" requires "does").

গ Does Madrid tolerate late-night noise easily? — Interrogative form: use the auxiliary "does" + subject + base verb to form a yes/no question for present simple tense.

ঘ Tourists admire the historic buildings, and they often take photographs of them. — Compound sentence: join two related independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction "and" to form a compound sentence; both clauses are closely related in meaning and share the same subject (tourists).

Explanation:
Explanation of transformations and choices:
- Passive: To form the passive, make the active object's role the subject and use the appropriate form of "be" + past participle. Because "work at" is a phrasal/idiomatic verb, a literal passive can be clumsy; I provided the literal passive and noted a more natural paraphrase.
- Negative: For present simple with third-person singular subjects (Elena), use "does not" + base verb.
- Interrogative: Present simple questions for third-person singular use "does" + subject + base verb; the sentence becomes a yes/no question.
- Compound: Combine two independent but related ideas using a coordinating conjunction (for example "and") to make a compound sentence; ensure both clauses are grammatically complete.

Question:
Sana commutes by train every morning. (a) Sana commutes by train every morning. (b) Her parents visit during festivals. (c) Kuala Lumpur can be expensive to live in. (d) The market sells tropical fruits. (e) She sometimes feels homesick.

Options:
ক. Rewrite sentence (a) as a complex sentence.
খ. Rewrite sentence (b) as an interrogative sentence.
গ. Rewrite sentence (c) as a negative sentence.
ঘ. Rewrite sentence (d) in the passive voice.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Since Sana works in the city center, she commutes by train every morning. — Complex sentence: starts with a subordinate clause "Since Sana works in the city center" (reason) followed by the main clause about her commuting.

খ Do her parents visit during festivals? — Interrogative form: form a yes/no question in present simple by placing the auxiliary "do" before the subject and using the base verb "visit." (If the subject were third-person singular with a verb that needs "does," we'd use "does," but "parents" is plural so we use "do".)

গ Kuala Lumpur cannot be cheap to live in. / Kuala Lumpur is not cheap to live in. — Negative form: add "not" (or "cannot be"/"is not") to negate the original positive statement. "Kuala Lumpur is not cheap to live in" is a straightforward negative equivalent.

ঘ Tropical fruits are sold at the market. — Passive voice: make the object "tropical fruits" the subject and use "are sold" (present simple passive) followed by the agent "at the market" as a locative complement.

Explanation:
Notes on each transformation:
- Complex sentence: introduce a dependent clause (time, reason, condition, or relative clause) to add depth while keeping the original meaning.
- Interrogative: for plural subjects in present simple, use "do" + subject + base verb; for third-person singular use "does." Ensure correct subject-verb agreement.
- Negative: add "not" to the appropriate auxiliary or use "is not"/"cannot be" depending on nuance; both forms shown convey that living there is not inexpensive.
- Passive: change the object into the subject position and use the correct form of "to be" + past participle ("are sold"). The agent (the market) can be included as a prepositional phrase or omitted if not needed.
These conversions follow standard English grammar rules for sentence transformation while preserving intended meanings.

Question:
(a) The baker had just baked a loaf for his employer. (b) The aroma was so tempting that he could not resist. (c) He ate one slice. (d) When his employer sat down to eat, he noticed the missing slice.

Options:
ক. Convert sentence (a) into passive voice.
খ. Combine sentences (b) and (c) into a single simple sentence.
গ. Rewrite sentence (d) as a compound sentence.
ঘ. Put sentence (c) into an interrogative form.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A loaf had just been baked for his employer by the baker. (Passive of: "The baker had just baked a loaf for his employer.")

খ The aroma tempted him to eat a slice. (Simple sentence combining the meaning of (b) and (c).)

গ His employer sat down to eat, and he noticed the missing slice. (Compound sentence formed by joining two independent clauses with "and".)

ঘ Did he eat one slice? (Interrogative form of: "He ate one slice.")

Explanation:
ক (Passive): To convert a past perfect or past action into passive, make the object of the active sentence the subject of the passive and use the appropriate form of "be" plus the past participle. "The baker had just baked a loaf..." becomes "A loaf had just been baked..." and you may add "by the baker" to show the agent.

খ (Simple sentence): A simple sentence has one independent clause. To combine (b) "The aroma was so tempting" and (c) "He ate one slice" into one simple clause, compress the cause-effect into a single predicate: use a verb that takes the object directly ("tempted him to eat"). Hence: "The aroma tempted him to eat a slice."

গ (Compound sentence): A compound sentence joins two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). The original (d) is a complex sentence with a subordinate clause "When his employer sat down to eat..." To make it compound, convert the subordinate clause into an independent clause and join: "His employer sat down to eat, and he noticed the missing slice."

ঘ (Interrogative): For a past simple affirmative like "He ate one slice," form the question with auxiliary do/does/did. Past simple uses "did" + base verb: "Did he eat one slice?" This uses subject-auxiliary inversion appropriate for yes/no questions.

Question:
(a) The tailor stitched a new coat for his master. (b) He admired the coat so much that he could not help himself. (c) He put a handkerchief into one pocket. (d) Later the master discovered the handkerchief was missing.

Options:
ক. Write a negative form of sentence (a).
খ. Rewrite sentence (b) as a concise simple sentence.
গ. Make an interrogative sentence from (c).
ঘ. Combine (c) and (d) into a compound sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The tailor did not stitch a new coat for his master. (Negative of: "The tailor stitched a new coat for his master.")

খ He admired the coat intensely. (Concise simple sentence expressing the meaning of (b).)

গ Did he put a handkerchief into one pocket? (Interrogative form of: "He put a handkerchief into one pocket.")

ঘ He put a handkerchief into one pocket, but later the master discovered it was missing. (Compound sentence joining two independent clauses with "but".)

Explanation:
ক (Negative): For past simple verbs, form the negative with "did not" + base form of the verb: "did not stitch." So "The tailor did not stitch..." correctly negates the past action.

খ (Simple sentence): To make (b) concise and simple, remove the subordinate clause structure and express the idea in one independent clause: "He admired the coat intensely." This keeps one subject and one predicate.

গ (Interrogative): Convert a past simple statement into a question using "did" + base verb and invert subject and auxiliary: "Did he put... ?"

ঘ (Compound sentence): Join two independent clauses that express related events. Use a coordinating conjunction (here "but" because the second clause expresses a contrasting/unexpected result). The first clause is "He put a handkerchief into one pocket," the second is "later the master discovered it was missing."

Question:
(a) A fisherman caught a large fish for his landlord. (b) The fish smelled so tempting that he could not resist. (c) He cooked it and ate a portion. (d) When the landlord began his meal, he noticed the missing portion.

Options:
ক. Turn sentence (a) into passive voice.
খ. Make a simple sentence that captures the meaning of (b).
গ. Form an interrogative from sentence (c).
ঘ. Join (c) and (d) to form a compound sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A large fish was caught for his landlord by the fisherman. (Passive of: "A fisherman caught a large fish for his landlord.")

খ The fish smelled irresistible. (Simple sentence expressing the meaning of (b).)

গ Did he cook it and eat a portion? (Interrogative form of: "He cooked it and ate a portion.")

ঘ He cooked it and ate a portion, and the landlord later noticed the missing portion. (Compound sentence joining two independent clauses with "and".)

Explanation:
ক (Passive): To form the passive from a past simple active sentence, make the object the subject and use the appropriate form of "be" + past participle. "A large fish" (object) becomes the subject: "A large fish was caught..." Optionally add "by the fisherman" to show the agent.

খ (Simple sentence): A simple sentence should have one independent clause. Replace the two-part idea "smelled so tempting that he could not resist" with a single descriptive clause: "The fish smelled irresistible."

গ (Interrogative): For compound actions in past simple ("cooked" and "ate"), form a yes/no question using "did" + base verbs and keep the coordinated verbs: "Did he cook it and eat a portion?" This is the natural interrogative form.

ঘ (Compound sentence): Join the action the fisherman took and the landlord's later discovery as two independent clauses connected by a coordinating conjunction. Using "and" keeps the sequence clear: "He cooked it and ate a portion, and the landlord later noticed the missing portion."

Question:
Football often ignites passion and unity among supporters across countries. Convert or rewrite the following sentences as directed.

Options:
ক. People all over the world watch football with enthusiasm. (passive)
খ. When the underdog team scored the final goal, the crowd erupted in joy. (complex)
গ. This match is more thrilling than yesterday's game. (comparative)
ঘ. Although equipment can be expensive, youngsters enjoy playing on the streets. (compound)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Football is watched with enthusiasm by people all over the world. খ The crowd erupted in joy because the underdog team had scored the final goal. গ This match is more thrilling than yesterday's game. ঘ Equipment can be expensive, but youngsters enjoy playing on the streets.

Explanation:
ক: To form the passive of an active sentence, make the object the subject and use the appropriate form of "to be" + past participle. "People ... watch football" becomes "Football is watched ... by people." খ: A complex sentence contains an independent clause and at least one subordinate clause. The original already implies cause; rewriting as "The crowd erupted in joy because the underdog team had scored the final goal" makes the causal relationship explicit and uses a past perfect for the earlier event (the goal) relative to the eruption. গ: The sentence already uses a comparative structure: "more thrilling than" correctly compares the two matches, so no change is needed. ঘ: A compound sentence links two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction. Starting with "Although" makes the clause subordinate (complex). Change the subordinating conjunction to a coordinating one: "Equipment can be expensive, but youngsters enjoy playing on the streets." This yields a compound sentence.

ক. The teachers praised the performers warmly. (passive)
খ. Students sang folk songs. They also performed a sketch. (compound)
গ. You will join the rehearsal tomorrow. (interrogative)
ঘ. It was an unforgettable evening. (exclamatory)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The performers were praised warmly by the teachers. খ Students sang folk songs and performed a sketch. গ Will you join the rehearsal tomorrow? ঘ What an unforgettable evening it was!

Explanation:
ক: Passive voice: make the object (the performers) the subject and use "were praised" (past tense of "to be" + past participle "praised"), adding the agent with "by the teachers." খ: Compound sentence: join the two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction "and" and drop the second subject if it is the same for conciseness: "Students sang folk songs and performed a sketch." গ: Interrogative form: convert the declarative "You will join..." into a yes/no question by inverting the subject and auxiliary verb: "Will you join...?" ঘ: Exclamatory sentence: to express strong feeling, use the exclamatory structure "What an + adjective + noun + subject + verb!" — "What an unforgettable evening it was!"

Question:
The monsoon brings relief and challenges—farmers welcome the rains but cities sometimes suffer floods. Make the following transformations.

Options:
ক. Heavy rains feed the paddy fields. (passive)
খ. This year's monsoon is milder than last year's. (comparative)
গ. People sometimes suffer severe losses due to floods. (exclamatory)
ঘ. The river overflowed and the farmers lost their harvests. (complex)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The paddy fields are fed by heavy rains. খ This year's monsoon is milder than last year's monsoon. গ What terrible losses people sometimes suffer due to floods! ঘ When the river overflowed, the farmers lost their harvests.

Explanation:
ক: Passive transformation: make the object "the paddy fields" into the subject, use the present passive "are fed" (matching the original tense/context) and add the agent with "by heavy rains" (optional). I used "The paddy fields are fed by heavy rains." খ: Comparative: to compare two items, use comparative adjective/adverb followed by "than"; adding "monsoon" after "last year's" clarifies the comparison: "This year's monsoon is milder than last year's monsoon." ("Monsoon" can be omitted in the second phrase if context is clear.) গ: Exclamatory: convert the declarative into an exclamation to show strong feeling. Using "What/How" structures is common. Here, "What terrible losses people sometimes suffer due to floods!" expresses strong emotion about the losses. (Alternative natural form: "How often people suffer terrible losses due to floods!" both are exclamatory.) ঘ: Complex sentence: connect two related events with a subordinate clause showing time or condition. Using a temporal subordinating conjunction yields: "When the river overflowed, the farmers lost their harvests."

Question:
Rana wrote an e-mail to his friend Mitu last night explaining his new study plan. He also advised her to practise speaking English every day and to remain calm before exams.

Options:
ক. Change to passive: "Rana wrote an e-mail to Mitu last night." (passive)
খ. Change into a complex sentence: "He advised her to practise speaking English every day." (complex)
গ. Make the following a simple sentence: "In the e-mail he told her that she should remain calm before the exams." (simple)
ঘ. Change to an interrogative: "Mitu writes to Rana often." (interrogative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক An e-mail was written to Mitu by Rana last night.

খ He advised that she should practise speaking English every day.

গ He told her, "Be calm before the exams."

ঘ Does Mitu often write to Rana?

Explanation:
ক: To form the passive of a simple past active sentence (Rana wrote an e-mail...), move the object to the subject position (an e-mail), use the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' + past participle (was written), and add the agent with 'by' if needed (by Rana). The time expression 'last night' remains at the end.

খ: A complex sentence contains a main clause plus a subordinate clause. Converting the imperative/advice into reported speech commonly produces a complex sentence: 'He advised that she should practise...' Here 'that she should practise speaking English every day' is the subordinate clause reporting his advice.

গ: A simple sentence is a single independent clause expressing a complete thought. Converting a reported complex clause into a direct short simple sentence often uses quotation or a direct imperative. 'He told her, "Be calm before the exams."' is a simple declarative (report of a single utterance) or can be treated as a simple sentence reporting direct speech.

ঘ: To form an interrogative in the simple present from a declarative 'Mitu writes to Rana often', we invert the auxiliary/do-support: 'Does Mitu often write to Rana?' (use 'does' + base verb 'write' because the subject is third-person singular).

Question:
Amina sent a parcel to her cousin on Sunday and left a short note asking the cousin to open it carefully. She often helps her cousin with studies and believes he is more diligent than most of his classmates.

Options:
ক. Convert to passive: "Amina sent a parcel to her cousin on Sunday." (passive)
খ. Change to indirect (reported) speech: "Amina said, 'Please open the parcel carefully.'" (reported)
গ. Make the sentence negative: "She often helps her cousin with his studies." (negative)
ঘ. Change to comparative: "She believes he is more diligent than most of his classmates." (comparative form or rephrase)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A parcel was sent to her cousin by Amina on Sunday.

খ Amina requested him to open the parcel carefully.

গ She does not always help her cousin with his studies.  (or) She does not help her cousin with his studies regularly.

ঘ She thinks he is more diligent than most of his classmates.

Explanation:
ক: Passive form: move the object 'a parcel' to the subject position, use the correct passive auxiliary + past participle ('was sent'), and optionally add the agent with 'by Amina'. Time expression 'on Sunday' stays in place.

খ: Converting a direct imperative/request into reported speech: change the verb form and pronouns/time words as needed. 'Please open the parcel carefully.' becomes 'Amina requested him to open the parcel carefully.' (request -> requested + infinitive)

গ: To make the present simple sentence negative we use do-support: 'She often helps...' becomes 'She does not often help...' or 'She does not always help...' depending on nuance. Either 'does not often help' or 'does not always help' correctly negates the frequency. I provided an alternative wording for clarity.

ঘ: The given sentence is already comparative in meaning ('more diligent than most of his classmates'). Rephrasing to keep comparative structure: 'She thinks he is more diligent than most of his classmates.' If required to form a different comparative sentence: 'She considers him more diligent than his classmates.' Both keep the comparative marker 'more' + adjective + 'than' phrase.

Options:
ক. Turn into passive: "The teacher praised the students last week." (passive)
খ. Combine the two sentences into a compound sentence: "The teacher praised the students. She reminded them to submit their assignments on time." (compound)
গ. Convert to indirect speech: "The teacher said, 'Submit your assignments by Friday.'" (indirect/reporting)
ঘ. Change to an exclamatory sentence: "The class was so hardworking!" (exclamatory)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The students were praised by the teacher last week.

খ The teacher praised the students and reminded them to submit their assignments on time.

গ The teacher asked them to submit their assignments by Friday.

ঘ What a hardworking class they are!

Explanation:
ক: Passive formation: 'The teacher praised the students' -> object 'the students' becomes the subject, auxiliary 'were' + past participle 'praised' gives 'The students were praised', and the agent is added with 'by the teacher'. Keep the time expression 'last week'.

খ: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses of related ideas usually with a coordinating conjunction. Here we join using 'and': 'The teacher praised the students and reminded them...' Both verbs share the same subject 'The teacher'.

গ: Reporting a command/request uses verbs like 'asked' or 'told' + infinitive: direct 'Submit your assignments by Friday' becomes 'The teacher asked them to submit their assignments by Friday.' Note changes in pronoun/tense/wording appropriate for indirect speech.

ঘ: Exclamatory sentences express strong feeling. Two common exclamatory forms: 'What + a/an + noun + subject + verb!' or 'How + adjective + subject + verb!' From 'The class was so hardworking' we create 'What a hardworking class they are!' which is natural and emphasizes admiration.

Question:
Context: A brave soldier risks his life to protect his country and inspire others by his example.

Options:
ক. Convert the sentence "A brave soldier risks his life to protect his country." into a complex sentence.
খ. Change it into a simple sentence.
গ. Make a negative sentence from the original.
ঘ. Convert the sentence into passive voice.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A brave soldier risks his life in order that he may protect his country. খ A brave soldier protects his country. গ A brave soldier does not hesitate to risk his life to protect his country. ঘ Lives are risked by brave soldiers to protect their country.

Explanation:
ক (Complex): To form a complex sentence we join a main clause with a subordinate clause expressing purpose or reason. "in order that he may protect his country" is a subordinate clause of purpose, so the sentence becomes complex. 

খ (Simple): A simple sentence has a single independent clause. "A brave soldier protects his country." conveys the main idea succinctly as one independent clause. 

গ (Negative): To make a negative while retaining the original meaning we use a negative expression that fits naturally—"does not hesitate to"—which negates hesitation rather than the brave action itself; this keeps the intended positive sense while using a negative form. 

ঘ (Passive): To convert to passive we promote the object to subject. Since the plural passive sounds more natural and generalizes the statement, "Lives are risked by brave soldiers to protect their country" is used. A literal passive of "A brave soldier risks his life" would be awkward singularly ("The life of a brave soldier is risked...") so the plural passive improves readability.

Question:
Context: We believe that steady hard work often leads to achievement and self-respect; the saying emphasizes effort over luck.

Options:
ক. Turn the sentence "Hard work often leads to success and self-respect." into a complex sentence.
খ. Make a short simple sentence that conveys the same idea.
গ. Change the sentence into an exclamatory form.
ঘ. Express the idea as a comparative sentence, comparing hard work with luck.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক If one works hard, one often attains success and gains self-respect. খ Hard work brings success. গ How rewarding hard work is when it brings success and self-respect! ঘ Hard work is more likely than luck to bring success and self-respect.

Explanation:
ক (Complex): A complex sentence connects an independent clause with a dependent clause. Using a conditional clause "If one works hard" makes the sentence complex and shows cause-effect. 

খ (Simple): The simple form "Hard work brings success" reduces the idea to a single independent clause while preserving meaning. 

গ (Exclamatory): Exclamatory sentences express strong feeling. Starting with "How" and restructuring the sentence gives emphasis: "How rewarding hard work is..." 

ঘ (Comparative): To compare hard work with luck we use a comparative structure "more likely than" to show greater propensity: "Hard work is more likely than luck to bring..." This retains the original idea while explicitly comparing two causes of success.

Question:
Context: A teacher supports students when they are confused, encouraging questions and guiding them toward understanding.

Options:
ক. Make a negative sentence from: "A teacher guides students when they are confused and encourages them to ask questions."
খ. Change the sentence into passive voice.
গ. Turn it into a complex sentence using a suitable subordinating conjunction.
ঘ. Rewrite the sentence as a stronger affirmative statement.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A teacher does not abandon students when they are confused and does not discourage them from asking questions. খ Students are guided by a teacher when they are confused, and they are encouraged to ask questions. গ Because students may feel confused, a teacher guides them and encourages them to ask questions so that they understand better. ঘ A teacher always guides confused students and encourages them to ask questions.

Explanation:
ক (Negative): Forming the negative while preserving the supportive meaning is best done by negating abandonment or discouragement ("does not abandon... does not discourage..."). This keeps the positive role of the teacher clear while using negative forms. 

খ (Passive): Each transitive verb is converted so that the original object becomes the grammatical subject: "Students are guided... and they are encouraged..." This keeps the meaning and clearly shows the actions performed on students. 

গ (Complex): Use subordinators like "because" and purpose clauses like "so that" to create a complex sentence that shows reason and purpose: "Because... so that..." connects the cause (students confused), the teacher's actions, and the intended result. 

ঘ (Affirmative / Stronger): Strengthening the affirmative can be done by adding adverbs like "always" to emphasize the teacher's consistent helpful behavior: "A teacher always guides... and encourages...." This is a direct, emphatic affirmative sentence.

Question:
Every winter a group of swans arrives from Siberia to spend time in our wetlands.

Options:
ক. (Make it simple)
খ. (Make it complex)
গ. (Make it passive)
ঘ. (Make it negative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Swans come to our wetlands every winter. (Simplified by removing the phrase "a group of" and the origin "from Siberia" to make a short, direct sentence.)

খ Because the northern lakes freeze over, a group of swans arrives from Siberia to spend the winter in our wetlands. (Made complex by adding the subordinate clause expressing cause: "Because the northern lakes freeze over".)

গ Our wetlands are visited by a group of swans every winter. (Passive form: the original active verb "arrives" is changed to passive "are visited by" so the wetlands become the grammatical subject.)

ঘ A group of swans does not come to our wetlands during the summer. (Negative form: the verb is negated with "does not come" and the sentence specifies summer to contrast the original winter statement.)

Explanation:
ক (Simple): To make a sentence simple, remove extra modifiers and subordinate details so the main idea remains clear. Here we remove "a group of" and the origin to produce a concise statement.

খ (Complex): A complex sentence contains a main clause and at least one subordinate clause (cause, time, condition, etc.). Adding "Because the northern lakes freeze over" provides a reason, turning it into a complex sentence.

গ (Passive): To form the passive voice, make the object of the active sentence into the subject of the passive sentence and use the appropriate form of "be" + past participle. "A group of swans arrives" is awkward in direct passive, so we reframe: "Our wetlands are visited by a group of swans." This keeps the meaning while using passive structure.

ঘ (Negative): To negate, insert the appropriate auxiliary (do/does/did + not, or modal + not) before the main verb. Here "does not come" negates the action; specifying "during the summer" gives a natural negative contrast to the original winter arrival.

Large flocks of cranes often visit the rice fields in the cold months, and sometimes they arrive later than smaller birds.

Options:
ক. (Make it simple)
খ. (Make it complex)
গ. (Make it passive)
ঘ. (Make it positive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Cranes visit the rice fields in winter. (Simplified by removing "large flocks", "often", and the comparative clause to create a concise statement.)

খ Although smaller birds reach the fields earlier, large flocks of cranes still visit the rice fields during the cold months to feed. (Made complex by adding the concessive clause "Although smaller birds reach the fields earlier" and an additional purpose clause.)

গ The rice fields are visited by large flocks of cranes in the cold months. (Passive form: the object "the rice fields" becomes the subject and "are visited by" is used.)

ঘ Smaller birds arrive at the fields earlier than the cranes. (Positive comparative: rephrased the original "they arrive later than smaller birds" into a positive comparative statement emphasizing the earlier arrival of smaller birds.)

Explanation:
ক (Simple): Shorten the sentence to its core subject and verb, dropping extra modifiers and subordinate clauses.

খ (Complex): Add one or more subordinate clauses (time, reason, contrast, purpose) to make the sentence structurally complex. Here a concessive clause and a purpose phrase are included.

গ (Passive): Convert the active construction so that the original object becomes the grammatical subject, and use "be" + past participle plus "by" to indicate the agent.

ঘ (Positive): Turning a statement that uses a negative comparative notion ("arrive later than") into a positive comparative flips the perspective but retains the comparison. "A arrives later than B" becomes "B arrives earlier than A."

Hundreds of migratory ducks fly long distances every year to reach safe lakes where they can feed and rest.

Options:
ক. (Make it simple)
খ. (Make it complex)
গ. (Make it passive)
ঘ. (Make it negative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Migratory ducks fly to safe lakes each year. (Simplified by shortening phrases and keeping the essential idea: movement to safe lakes annually.)

খ Because their breeding grounds become inhospitable, hundreds of migratory ducks fly long distances each year to reach safe lakes where they can feed and rest. (Made complex by adding the causal subordinate clause "Because their breeding grounds become inhospitable".)

গ Safe lakes are reached by hundreds of migratory ducks each year so they can feed and rest. (Passive form: "safe lakes" becomes the subject and "are reached by" introduces the agent.)

ঘ Hundreds of migratory ducks do not stay in their breeding areas when winter comes. (Negative form: negates the action of staying in the breeding areas and keeps the seasonal contrast; uses "do not stay" as the negative construction.)

Explanation:
ক (Simple): Remove modifiers and subordinate phrases to present the core action and subject succinctly.

খ (Complex): Introduce a subordinate clause (cause, time, condition, etc.) to expand the sentence into a complex structure. Here a causal clause explains why they fly.

গ (Passive): Make the destination the grammatical subject and use the appropriate "be" + past participle form with "by" to name the agent. Some passive sentences may require slight rephrasing to sound natural.

ঘ (Negative): Use the auxiliary "do/does/did + not" or a negative modal to negate the main verb. The negative sentence here contrasts the ducks' behavior in winter by stating they do not remain in breeding areas.

Options:
ক. (a) Make this sentence negative.
খ. (b) Change this sentence into an interrogative sentence.
গ. (c) Convert the imperative into an assertive sentence.
ঘ. (e) Put this active sentence into the passive voice.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Knowledge is not power.

খ Must we read often?

গ We should not waste time. (or One should not waste time.)

ঘ New worlds are opened by books.

Explanation:
ক: To make an affirmative simple present sentence negative when the verb is a form of `be`, insert `not` after the verb: `is` → `is not`.

খ: For modal verbs like `must`, form the question by inverting the modal and the subject: `We must...` → `Must we...`.

গ: An imperative (Don't waste time.) gives a command. To convert to an assertive sentence expressing advice, supply a subject and a modal or auxiliary: `You should not...` or more generally `We/One should not...`.

ঘ: To change an active sentence to passive, make the object (`new worlds`) the subject, use the appropriate form of `be` with the main verb's past participle, and optionally add the agent with `by`: `New worlds are opened by books.`

Read the following context: (a) Everyone loves success. (Affirmative) (b) Respect your colleagues. (Imperative) (c) It must be earned. (Passive) (d) Who can deny cooperation? (Interrogative) (e) Cooperation is essential. (Simple)

Options:
ক. (a) Express this idea negatively (use natural English).
খ. (b) Convert the imperative into an interrogative request.
গ. (c) Change this passive sentence into active voice.
ঘ. (d) Turn this question into an exclamatory sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Not everyone loves success.

খ Will you respect your colleagues? (or: Will you show respect to your colleagues?)

গ One must earn it. (or: People must earn it.)

ঘ How essential cooperation is! (or: What an essential thing cooperation is!)

Explanation:
ক: In English, `Everyone does not...` can be ambiguous, so `Not everyone...` is the preferred natural negative.

খ: To turn a command into a polite interrogative/request, use a modal or auxiliary like `will` (or `would`) + subject + verb: `Respect your colleagues.` → `Will you respect your colleagues?` which softens the command into a question/request.

গ: `It must be earned.` is passive (it = the thing). To make it active, introduce an agent-general subject such as `one` or `people`: `One must earn it.` This preserves meaning and removes passive structure.

ঘ: Change the interrogative `Who can deny cooperation?` to an exclamation expressing strong feeling about cooperation's importance: `How essential cooperation is!` or the alternative exclamatory structure `What an essential thing cooperation is!` Both turn the question into an emphatic statement.

Question:
Consider these sentences about the environment: (a) Trees provide shade. (Active) (b) Don't pollute rivers. (Imperative) (c) If we protect nature, it will protect us. (Conditional) (d) Is there anyone who dislikes fresh air? (Interrogative) (e) Clean air is vital. (Affirmative)

Options:
ক. (a) Change this active sentence into the passive voice.
খ. (b) Convert this command into an affirmative suggestion.
গ. (c) Make this conditional sentence negative.
ঘ. (d) Turn this question into an assertive (declarative) sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Shade is provided by trees.

খ We should not pollute rivers. (or: We must avoid polluting rivers.)

গ If we do not protect nature, it will not protect us.

ঘ Everyone likes fresh air. (or: People do not dislike fresh air.)

Explanation:
ক: To form the passive from an active sentence, make the object (`shade`) the subject, use the correct form of `be` plus the past participle (`provided`), and optionally add the agent with `by trees`.

খ: An imperative negative command like `Don't pollute rivers.` becomes an affirmative suggestion by adding a subject and modal expressing advice: `We should not...` or a constructive form `We must avoid polluting rivers.`

গ: To negate the conditional, negate either the protasis or the apodosis appropriately. Here negating both parts preserves parallel meaning: `If we do not protect nature, it will not protect us.` Note the auxiliary `do` is used to form the negative in the present simple.

ঘ: The question `Is there anyone who dislikes fresh air?` implies that no one dislikes it. A natural declarative conversion is `Everyone likes fresh air.` which states the implied assertion directly.

Question:
A poor farmer sold his only cow to pay for his son's tuition.

Options:
ক. Write the passive form of the sentence.
খ. Make the sentence negative (past tense).
গ. Convert the sentence into a complex sentence showing purpose.
ঘ. Write an exclamatory sentence that conveys the emotion of the event.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The farmer's only cow was sold by him to pay for his son's tuition.

খ The poor farmer did not sell his only cow to pay for his son's tuition.

গ The poor farmer sold his only cow so that he could pay for his son's tuition.

ঘ What a sad thing it was that the poor farmer had to sell his only cow!

Explanation:
ক (Passive): To form the passive of a past simple sentence, make the object the subject and use the past participle of the verb with the appropriate form of 'be'. The active sentence "The farmer sold his only cow..." becomes "The farmer's only cow was sold..." Adding 'by him' is optional but acceptable.

খ (Negative): For the simple past negative we use 'did not' + base verb. The base verb of 'sold' is 'sell', so the negative is 'did not sell'. Hence: 'The poor farmer did not sell his only cow...'. Note this changes the meaning to the negative.

গ (Complex — purpose): To express purpose use connectors like 'so that' or 'in order that'. Because the farmer's action was done to pay tuition, we use: '...so that he could pay for his son's tuition.' The sentence becomes a complex sentence with a main clause and a purpose subordinate clause.

ঘ (Exclamatory): Exclamatory sentences often begin with 'What' or 'How' and convey strong feeling. To show sorrow at the event, 'What a sad thing it was...' or 'How sad it was that...' are natural exclamatory forms. Use an exclamation mark to complete the emotion.

Question:
A young violinist performed at the city hall and received a standing ovation.

Options:
ক. Put the sentence into passive voice.
খ. Make the compound sentence negative (past tense).
গ. Combine the two actions into a complex sentence showing time (use 'after' or 'when').
ঘ. Write an exclamatory sentence expressing admiration for the performance.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A standing ovation was given to the young violinist after his performance at the city hall.

খ The young violinist did not perform at the city hall and did not receive a standing ovation.

গ After the young violinist performed at the city hall, the audience gave him a standing ovation.

ঘ What an extraordinary performance the young violinist gave at the city hall!

Explanation:
ক (Passive): The original has two related actions. To make the result ('received a standing ovation') passive and natural-sounding, we render it as 'A standing ovation was given to the young violinist...' This keeps the focus on the ovation and uses passive construction.

খ (Negative): For negation in past simple we use 'did not' + base verb. Since there are two coordinated actions, negate both: 'did not perform' and 'did not receive'. This preserves grammatical structure while altering meaning.

গ (Complex — time): Using 'after' (or 'when') creates a complex sentence that links time: the subordinate clause 'After the young violinist performed...' precedes the main clause describing the audience's reaction. This clarifies sequence.

ঘ (Exclamatory): To express strong admiration, begin with 'What' and a noun phrase: 'What an extraordinary performance...' followed by an exclamation mark. This structure emphasizes emotion and praise.

Question:
Air quality is deteriorating in many urban areas because of emissions and careless practices. Transform the following sentences as instructed.

Options:
ক. Factories release pollutants into the atmosphere. (passive)
খ. Clean air is necessary for humans. (complex)
গ. Cars produce exhaust. People ignore the warnings. (compound)
ঘ. Air is one of the most important elements for life. (positive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Pollutants are released into the atmosphere by factories.

খ Clean air, which humans need for good health, is necessary for survival.

গ Cars produce exhaust, but people often ignore the warnings.

ঘ Air is important for all living beings.

Explanation:
ক: To make the sentence passive, make the object ('pollutants') the subject and add the agent with 'by': 'Pollutants are released into the atmosphere by factories.'

খ: A complex sentence contains a main clause and a subordinate clause. Adding a relative clause ('which humans need for good health') turns the simple assertion into a complex sentence while preserving meaning.

গ: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses. Joining with a coordinating conjunction and a comma (', but') yields: 'Cars produce exhaust, but people often ignore the warnings.' The contrast clarifies the relationship.

ঘ: Converting from a superlative/relative construction ('one of the most important') to the positive degree simplifies the adjective: 'Air is important for all living beings.' This keeps the basic assertion without comparative/superlative degree.

Options:
ক. People cut down trees recklessly. (passive)
খ. Forests provide habitats and regulate the climate. (complex)
গ. Villagers plant saplings. They also water them regularly. (compound)
ঘ. Deforestation is harmful to biodiversity. (negative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Trees are cut down recklessly by people.

খ Forests, which provide habitats, also regulate the climate.

গ Villagers plant saplings, and they water them regularly.

ঘ Deforestation does not benefit biodiversity.

Explanation:
ক: Passive voice: promote the object ('trees') to subject position and add the agent with 'by': 'Trees are cut down recklessly by people.'

খ: Complex sentence: include a relative/subordinate clause ('which provide habitats') to create a main clause plus subordinate information, producing one complex sentence.

গ: Compound sentence: join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction and comma: 'Villagers plant saplings, and they water them regularly.' This keeps both complete ideas.

ঘ: Negative transformation: express the harmful assertion in a negated positive verb form: 'Deforestation does not benefit biodiversity.' This states the same idea using negation.

Question:
A little boy found a stray puppy on the street and took it home.

Options:
ক. Change the sentence to passive voice.
খ. Rewrite the sentence in the negative (past tense).
গ. Turn the compound sentence into a single simple sentence (one independent clause).
ঘ. Write an exclamatory sentence that highlights the boy's kindness.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A stray puppy was found on the street by the little boy and was taken home by him.

খ The little boy did not find a stray puppy on the street and did not take it home.

গ The little boy took home a stray puppy he had found on the street.

ঘ How kind the little boy was to bring the stray puppy home!

Explanation:
ক (Passive): Each active verb ('found', 'took') can be converted to passive. We make the object 'a stray puppy' the subject and use the past participles 'was found' and 'was taken' with 'by the little boy' to indicate the agent. This preserves both actions in passive form.

খ (Negative): In the past simple, negation uses 'did not' + base verb. Negating both coordinated verbs yields 'did not find' and 'did not take'. This is the straightforward negative of the compound sentence.

গ (Simple): To convert to a single independent clause, compress the two actions into one clause that embeds the finding as a reduced relative or participial phrase: 'The little boy took home a stray puppy he had found on the street.' This is one simple sentence (one main clause) with an internal noun modifier.

ঘ (Exclamatory): To emphasize the boy's kindness use 'How' or 'What' exclamatory structures: 'How kind the little boy was...' or 'What a kind act it was...' followed by an exclamation mark to convey strong feeling.

Plastic waste is a growing environmental problem. Change the following sentences as directed to practice different sentence forms.

Options:
ক. People throw plastic bags into rivers. (passive)
খ. Reusable bags reduce plastic waste. (complex)
গ. Plastic bottles end up in landfills. Animals get harmed by them. (compound)
ঘ. Responsible use of plastic is better than careless disposal. (positive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Plastic bags are thrown into rivers by people.

খ Because reusable bags reduce plastic waste, consumers should choose them.

গ Plastic bottles end up in landfills, and animals are harmed by them.

ঘ Responsible use of plastic is beneficial.

Explanation:
ক: Passive transformation: make 'plastic bags' the subject and add 'by people' as the agent: 'Plastic bags are thrown into rivers by people.'

খ: Complex sentence: introduce a subordinate (adverbial) clause to show reason ('Because reusable bags reduce plastic waste') and add a main clause advising action; this forms a complex sentence.

গ: Compound sentence: connect the two independent clauses with 'and' plus a comma: 'Plastic bottles end up in landfills, and animals are harmed by them.' This links the cause and effect in one sentence.

ঘ: Positive (positive degree) form: change the comparative statement to a simple positive predicate: 'Responsible use of plastic is beneficial.' This conveys the same judgment without comparative language.

Options:
ক. Manufacturers sometimes mix harmful substances into fake drugs. (Make it passive)
খ. Several expired bottles were found on the shelf by the inspector. (Make it active)
গ. The government issued new regulations to control fake drugs. (Make it complex)
ঘ. Despite strict penalties, counterfeiters continue their activities because enforcement is weak. (Make it simple)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Harmful substances are sometimes mixed into fake drugs by manufacturers.

খ The inspector found several expired bottles on the shelf.

গ Because public health was threatened, the government issued new regulations to control fake drugs.

ঘ Counterfeiters continue their activities.

Explanation:
ক: To form the passive, the object 'harmful substances' becomes the subject, the verb changes to 'are mixed' (present simple passive) and the original subject 'manufacturers' appears after 'by'. The adverb 'sometimes' keeps its position.

খ: The passive clause 'were found ... by the inspector' is converted to active by making 'the inspector' the subject and returning the verb to active form 'found'. The rest of the sentence order is preserved.

গ: To make the sentence complex, a subordinate clause expressing reason ('Because public health was threatened, ...') is added before the main clause. This creates a complex sentence (one main clause + one subordinate clause).

ঘ: A simple sentence contains just one independent clause. Removing the concessive phrase and the reason clause yields the single independent clause 'Counterfeiters continue their activities.' which is simple and direct.

Air pollution in many urban areas is rising and endangering health. Transform the sentences below as instructed.

Options:
ক. Vehicles release harmful gases into the atmosphere. (Make it passive)
খ. Toxic particles were detected by the monitoring system. (Make it active)
গ. Factories and vehicles contribute to the smog problem. (Make it compound)
ঘ. If authorities acted quickly, air quality would improve significantly. (Make it simple)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Harmful gases are released into the atmosphere by vehicles.

খ The monitoring system detected toxic particles.

গ Factories contribute to the smog problem, and vehicles add to it.

ঘ Quick action by authorities would improve air quality.

Explanation:
ক: The object 'harmful gases' becomes the subject of the passive sentence; 'are released' is the passive verb form and 'by vehicles' indicates the agent.

খ: Converting the passive 'were detected by the monitoring system' into active places 'the monitoring system' as subject and uses the active verb 'detected'.

গ: A compound sentence connects two independent clauses of equal weight. Here, the two contributors are put into two clauses joined by 'and' to form a compound structure.

ঘ: The original is a conditional (complex) sentence. To make it simple, condense the idea into one independent clause: emphasize the main outcome and the necessary quick action ('Quick action by authorities would improve air quality'). This removes the subordinate conditional structure while preserving meaning.

খ. The vaccine was administered to the elderly by the health worker. (Make it active)
গ. Regular immunization reduces outbreaks and protects vulnerable groups. (Make it compound)
ঘ. Although some people fear side effects, vaccines are safe and effective. (Make it simple)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Vaccinations are received by children at community clinics.

খ The health worker administered the vaccine to the elderly.

গ Regular immunization reduces outbreaks, and it protects vulnerable groups.

ঘ Vaccines are safe and effective.

Explanation:
ক: To form the passive, the object 'vaccinations' becomes the subject and the verb becomes 'are received'; the original subject 'children' follows as the receiver in the passive structure.

খ: The passive clause 'was administered ... by the health worker' is turned into active by making 'the health worker' the subject and using the active verb form 'administered'.

গ: A compound sentence links two independent clauses of similar importance; adding a coordinating conjunction ('and') with an explicit subject in the second clause ('it') makes the compound clearer.

ঘ: Removing the concessive phrase 'Although some people fear side effects' yields the core independent clause 'Vaccines are safe and effective,' which is a simple sentence expressing the main idea directly.

Question:
Consider the importance of effort and virtues in shaping human success. Transform the following sentences as instructed.

Options:
ক. They will complete the project on time. (Passive)
খ. A diligent student can achieve high marks. (Complex)
গ. Hard work brings success. (Negative)
ঘ. No one attains greatness easily. (Positive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The project will be completed on time by them. খ A student who is diligent can achieve high marks. গ Success does not come without hard work. ঘ Only those who work hard attain greatness.

Explanation:
ক: To form the passive of a future tense clause with 'will', move the object to the subject position and use 'will be' + past participle; the agent may follow with 'by'. So 'They will complete the project on time' → 'The project will be completed on time by them.' খ: A complex sentence contains a main clause plus a subordinate clause. Turning a simple declarative about a 'diligent student' into a complex sentence can be done with a relative clause: 'A student who is diligent can achieve high marks.' This links the defining clause ('who is diligent') to the noun. গ: To express the idea negatively, restate so that absence of the condition blocks the result. 'Hard work brings success' becomes 'Success does not come without hard work' (negative form using auxiliary + not and a prepositional negation). ঘ: To convert a negative generalization into a positive-focused statement, use 'only' or restrict the subject: 'No one attains greatness easily' → 'Only those who work hard attain greatness.' This retains meaning while framing it positively.

Options:
ক. The teacher praised him for his honesty. (Passive)
খ. Respect for time brings success. (Complex)
গ. He always tells the truth. (Negative)
ঘ. Dishonesty never leads to lasting success. (Positive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক He was praised by the teacher for his honesty. খ If one respects time, one will achieve success. গ He never tells lies. ঘ Only honesty leads to lasting success.

Explanation:
ক: Convert the active sentence into passive by making the object ('him') the subject of the passive clause and using 'was praised' (past simple passive) followed by the agent 'by the teacher'. Hence: 'He was praised by the teacher for his honesty.' খ: To create a complex sentence, introduce a subordinate clause (here a conditional 'If' clause) that links cause and effect: 'If one respects time, one will achieve success.' This is a complex sentence with a dependent clause. গ: Transforming a positive statement to a negative equivalent often uses negation words; 'He always tells the truth' → 'He never tells lies' keeps the same meaning with a negative form (never + opposite noun). ঘ: The original negative statement about dishonesty can be rephrased positively by specifying the sole correct path: 'Only honesty leads to lasting success.' This emphasizes the positive condition for the result.

গ. Persistence makes talent useful. (Negative)
ঘ. It is clear that practice makes perfect. (Simple)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The results will be announced tomorrow. খ If an athlete is hardworking, he wins trophies. গ Talent is not useful without persistence. ঘ Practice makes perfect.

Explanation:
ক: For a future passive, place the object ('the results') as the subject and use 'will be' + past participle: 'The results will be announced tomorrow.' খ: To make the sentence complex, add a subordinate (conditional) clause: 'If an athlete is hardworking, he wins trophies.' Alternatively a relative clause ('An athlete who is hardworking wins trophies') also works; both create a complex sentence with dependent information. গ: Negating the positive statement 'Persistence makes talent useful' gives 'Talent is not useful without persistence' — here negation is achieved by 'not' and the prepositional phrase 'without persistence'. ঘ: 'It is clear that practice makes perfect' is a cleft/introductory construction. The simple direct statement is 'Practice makes perfect.' Removing the introductory phrase yields a concise simple sentence.

Options:
ক. Make the sentence "She always tells the truth." negative without changing the meaning.
খ. Make the sentence "Once she watched the children playing and smiled contentedly." passive.
গ. Make the sentence "A poem was composed by Maya last year." active.
ঘ. Combine into a complex sentence: "He returned home. He found the house empty."


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক She never tells a lie.
খ The children were watched by her once as they played, and she smiled contentedly.
গ Maya composed a poem last year.
ঘ When he returned home, he found the house empty.

Explanation:
ক: "She always tells the truth." can be expressed negatively without changing meaning by using an equivalent negative expression: "She never tells a lie." Both statements assert habitual truthfulness.

খ: To make "Once she watched the children playing and smiled contentedly" passive we convert the object "the children" into subject position: "The children were watched by her once as they played, and she smiled contentedly." (Note: because the original contains two actions, the passive form applies to the clause with a direct object; the smiling remains an active action by her.)

গ: "A poem was composed by Maya last year." is passive. Its active counterpart places the agent as the subject: "Maya composed a poem last year." Tense and meaning are preserved.

ঘ: Two short sentences are combined into a complex sentence by using a subordinating conjunction: "When he returned home, he found the house empty." This shows the temporal relationship and preserves meaning.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক None of them disobeyed the curfew.
খ The thief was arrested by the police that night.
গ Someone had taken her bag.
ঘ He lost the map, could not find the way and felt anxious.

Explanation:
ক: "They obeyed the curfew strictly." can be restated negatively as "None of them disobeyed the curfew." This preserves the original meaning (everyone complied).

খ: To form the passive of "The police arrested the thief that night," make the object (the thief) the subject and add the agent with "by": "The thief was arrested by the police that night." Tense and meaning are unchanged.

গ: Passive "Her bag had been taken by someone." becomes active by making the agent the subject: "Someone had taken her bag." The past perfect tense is kept.

ঘ: A simple sentence version drops subordinate connectors and links actions in a straightforward sequence: "He lost the map, could not find the way and felt anxious." This condenses the original complex sentence into a single sentence with coordinated verbs.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক No one spoke while listening.
খ The crowd was enthralled by the storyteller.
গ He had told the tale the previous night.
ঘ As he narrated the story, the listeners remembered their childhood.

Explanation:
ক: "Everyone listened in silence." means that nobody spoke; a negative equivalent is "No one spoke while listening," which conveys the same situation.

খ: To make "The storyteller enthralled the crowd" passive, turn the object "the crowd" into the subject: "The crowd was enthralled by the storyteller." The active agent is expressed with "by."

গ: The passive "The tale had been told by him the previous night" becomes active by making the agent the subject: "He had told the tale the previous night." Tense and aspect remain the same (past perfect).

ঘ: Combine the two sentences into a complex one using a subordinating conjunction to indicate simultaneous action or cause: "As he narrated the story, the listeners remembered their childhood." This links the narration with the listeners' memories in a single complex sentence.

The annual Dhaka Book Fair fills the grounds with excited readers and vibrant stalls. Read the following lines from a visitor's note: (a) The colorful stalls attracted readers from dawn. (simple) (b) People wandered along aisles searching for rare editions. (complex) (c) The famous author was welcomed by enthusiastic students. (passive) (d) I bought two books and met an old friend. (compound) (e) What a wonderful day for literature! (exclamatory)

Options:
ক. Which sentence is a simple sentence?
খ. Which sentence is a complex sentence?
গ. Which sentence is in the passive voice?
ঘ. Which sentence is exclamatory?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: Sentence (a) — "The colorful stalls attracted readers from dawn." This is a simple sentence with one independent clause.

খ উত্তর: Sentence (b) — "People wandered along aisles searching for rare editions." This is complex because it contains a main clause plus a subordinate participial phrase "searching for rare editions" that adds information.

গ উত্তর: Sentence (c) — "The famous author was welcomed by enthusiastic students." This is passive voice: the subject (the famous author) receives the action; the agent appears in a "by"-phrase.

ঘ উত্তর: Sentence (e) — "What a wonderful day for literature!" This is exclamatory (expresses strong feeling and ends with an exclamation).

Explanation:
Classification reasoning:
- Simple sentence: contains a single independent clause with subject and predicate (no dependent clauses). Sentence (a) has one clause: "The colorful stalls attracted readers from dawn." 
- Complex sentence: contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause or a non-finite subordinate phrase giving extra information. Sentence (b) has the main action "People wandered along aisles" plus the participial phrase "searching for rare editions" that modifies the subject/action — therefore complex.
- Passive voice: formed when the grammatical subject is the receiver of the action, typically using a form of "be" + past participle; the doer can appear in a "by"-phrase. Sentence (c) "was welcomed by enthusiastic students" matches this pattern.
- Exclamatory sentence: expresses strong feeling or emotion and usually ends with an exclamation mark. Sentence (e) is clearly exclamatory.

ঘ. Which sentence is simple?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: Sentence (a) — "Everyone wore new clothes and greeted one another warmly." This is a compound sentence: two independent actions joined by the coordinating conjunction "and." 

খ উত্তর: Sentence (b) — "Children who had waited all year burst into laughter at the sight of gifts." This is complex because it contains a relative clause "who had waited all year" modifying "Children." 

গ উত্তর: Sentence (c) — "The festive meal was prepared by neighbours." This is passive voice: subject receives the action; agent is given by "by neighbours." 

ঘ উত্তর: Sentence (d) — "The sun rose over the river in golden splendor." This is a simple sentence with a single independent clause describing one action.

Explanation:
Why each classification fits:
- Compound: consists of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for/and/nor/but/or/yet/so). In (a), "Everyone wore new clothes" and "greeted one another warmly" are coordinate actions connected by "and."
- Complex: contains an independent clause plus one or more dependent clauses (relative, adverbial, noun clauses, or participial phrases). In (b) "who had waited all year" is a relative (dependent) clause modifying "Children," making the whole sentence complex.
- Passive voice: uses a form of "be" + past participle and the subject is acted upon. Sentence (c) shows this structure: "was prepared" + "by neighbours."
- Simple: a single independent clause with no subordinate clauses. Sentence (d) has one main clause describing a single event.

Question:
Boat race day during the monsoon on the Buriganga: drums thrum, oars flash, and people crowd the banks. Read these event notes: (a) Boats sliced through the river like silver arrows. (simple) (b) While clouds gathered, the cheering never stopped. (complex) (c) The race trophies were presented to the winning crew. (passive) (d) The oarsmen pulled hard, and the crowd shouted encouragement. (compound)

Options:
ক. Identify the simple sentence.
খ. Identify the complex sentence.
গ. Identify the passive sentence.
ঘ. Identify the compound sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: Sentence (a) — "Boats sliced through the river like silver arrows." This is a simple sentence with a single independent clause.

খ উত্তর: Sentence (b) — "While clouds gathered, the cheering never stopped." This is complex because it has a subordinate adverbial clause "While clouds gathered" plus a main clause "the cheering never stopped." 

গ উত্তর: Sentence (c) — "The race trophies were presented to the winning crew." This is passive voice: "were presented" is a passive verb form and the subject receives the action.

ঘ উত্তর: Sentence (d) — "The oarsmen pulled hard, and the crowd shouted encouragement." This is a compound sentence: two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "and."

Explanation:
Explanation of classifications:
- Simple sentence: one independent clause conveying a single complete thought (subject + predicate). (a) fits this.
- Complex sentence: contains at least one dependent/subordinate clause and one independent clause. In (b), "While clouds gathered" is a dependent adverbial clause providing time/context; the main clause is "the cheering never stopped."
- Passive voice: the focus is on the receiver of the action; verb construction includes a form of "be" + past participle. (c) uses "were presented" and includes the recipient "to the winning crew."
- Compound sentence: two or more independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions or punctuation. In (d), both clauses could stand alone and are joined by "and."

Question:
Air is an essential component of the environment, but human actions have caused its quality to decline. Read the short sentences below and rewrite each as directed in the parentheses.

Options:
ক. Air is essential for life. Factories emit smoke into it. (compound)
খ. Clean air, which is free from harmful gases, is necessary for good health. (simple)
গ. People burn leaves and plastics and pollute the air. (passive)
ঘ. It is one of the most important elements for all living creatures. (positive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Air is essential for life, and factories emit smoke into it.খ Clean air is necessary for good health.গ Leaves and plastics are burned by people, and the air is polluted.ঘ It is an important element for all living creatures.

Explanation:
ক (Compound): To make a compound sentence, join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or). The two original sentences are independent, so we join them with 'and' and use a comma before it.

খ (Simple): The original has a relative clause ('which is free from harmful gases') making it complex. To make it simple, remove the relative clause and keep the core idea: 'Clean air is necessary for good health.' This is a single independent clause.

গ (Passive): The active clause 'People burn leaves and plastics and pollute the air' has two actions. In passive voice, the objects become subjects: 'Leaves and plastics are burned by people' and we indicate the resulting condition 'and the air is polluted.' Alternatively you can combine into 'Leaves and plastics are burned by people, polluting the air.' Both are acceptable passive constructions.

ঘ (Positive): 'One of the most important' is a superlative/degree expression. The positive (base) form removes the superlative: 'It is an important element for all living creatures.' This keeps the meaning while using the positive degree.

Question:
Rivers, once clean and life-sustaining, suffer from waste and toxic discharges. Below are brief statements about river pollution; rewrite each as requested.

Options:
ক. Plastics and chemicals enter the river. Many fish die. (complex)
খ. The river that used to be clean now carries waste. (simple)
গ. They throw garbage into the river. (passive)
ঘ. The river's condition is very bad. (positive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক When plastics and chemicals enter the river, many fish die.খ The river, once clean, now carries waste.গ Garbage is thrown into the river by them. (or simply: Garbage is thrown into the river.)ঘ The river is bad.

Explanation:
ক (Complex): To form a complex sentence, make one clause subordinate. Use a subordinating conjunction like 'when' to show cause and effect: 'When plastics and chemicals enter the river, many fish die.' The first clause is dependent; the second is independent.

খ (Simple): The original uses a relative clause ('that used to be clean') which makes it complex. Writing 'The river, once clean, now carries waste.' compresses the idea into a single independent clause (a simple sentence) with a parenthetical phrase 'once clean.'

গ (Passive): Convert the active sentence 'They throw garbage into the river' into passive: the object 'garbage' becomes the subject: 'Garbage is thrown into the river by them.' Often the agent 'by them' is optional: 'Garbage is thrown into the river.'

ঘ (Positive): 'Very bad' expresses degree; the positive (base) adjective is 'bad.' Reduce degree modifiers to produce the simple positive: 'The river is bad.' (If a milder positive is desired: 'The river is in poor condition.')

Question:
Soil fertility supports crops, but erosion and misuse reduce its productivity. Transform the following sentences as instructed.

Options:
ক. Farmers use chemical fertilizers to increase crop yield. (passive)
খ. If we protect the soil, future food will be secure. (simple)
গ. Soil is being eroded by heavy rains and deforestation. (compound)
ঘ. It is a source of nutrients for plants. (positive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Chemical fertilizers are used by farmers to increase crop yield.খ Soil protection ensures future food security.গ Heavy rains erode the soil, and deforestation worsens the erosion.ঘ Soil supplies nutrients to plants.

Explanation:
ক (Passive): The active verb phrase 'use chemical fertilizers' becomes passive: the object 'chemical fertilizers' becomes the subject: 'Chemical fertilizers are used by farmers.' Retain purpose: 'to increase crop yield.'

খ (Simple): The original is a conditional complex sentence. To make a clear simple sentence conveying the same meaning, compress into a single clause with a noun phrase subject and verb: 'Soil protection ensures future food security.' This expresses the cause-effect in one independent clause.

গ (Compound): The given sentence is in passive continuous form and lists two causes. To make a compound sentence, use two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction: 'Heavy rains erode the soil, and deforestation worsens the erosion.' Each clause can stand alone and they are joined with 'and.'

ঘ (Positive): 'A source of nutrients' is already descriptive; rephrase into a clear positive statement in active voice: 'Soil supplies nutrients to plants.' This uses the positive (base) verb 'supplies' and a direct structure.

Question:
A short note about football enthusiasm in the city: Football attracts crowds to the stadium, children play in parks, and many prefer short-format matches during festivals.

Options:
ক. Football is a thrilling game. (Exclamatory)
খ. Children play football in the park. (Passive)
গ. At present football is the most watched sport in our city. (Positive)
ঘ. They prefer watching T20 matches. (Interrogative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক What a thrilling game football is! (Alternatively: How thrilling football is!)

খ Football is played by children in the park.

গ At present football is popular in our city.

ঘ Do they prefer watching T20 matches?

Explanation:
ক — Exclamatory sentences express strong feeling. From the declarative "Football is a thrilling game," we form an exclamation using either "What a...!" before the noun: "What a thrilling game football is!" (or, using "How...": "How thrilling football is!").

খ — To change an active sentence to passive, make the object the subject and use the appropriate form of the verb "be" + past participle. Active: "Children play football in the park." Object "football" becomes subject: "Football is played by children in the park." (Present simple active → present simple passive.)

গ — "Positive" degree means the base form of the adjective without comparative or superlative. The original superlative "the most watched" is reduced to the positive adjective "popular". Thus: "At present football is popular in our city." You may also add adverbs for nuance (e.g., "very popular").

ঘ — To change a statement into a yes/no question in the simple present, use the auxiliary "do/does" plus the base verb. Statement: "They prefer watching T20 matches." Question: "Do they prefer watching T20 matches?" (If third-person singular subject were used, use "Does".)

Question:
A brief description of the school library: Students visit daily, borrow books, and the headmaster praises the quiet atmosphere.

Options:
ক. The school library is very quiet. (Exclamatory)
খ. Students borrow books every day. (Passive)
গ. This library is better than the old one. (Positive)
ঘ. Everyone reads quietly in the library. (Interrogative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক What a very quiet place the school library is! (Or: How very quiet the school library is!)

খ Books are borrowed by students every day. (Or: Books are borrowed from the library by students every day.)

গ This library is good. (Positive degree of the adjective ‘‘good’’ replaces the comparative "better")

ঘ Does everyone read quietly in the library?

Explanation:
ক — To form an exclamatory sentence from "The school library is very quiet," use exclamatory patterns such as "What...!" or "How...!" Example: "What a very quiet place the school library is!" or, more simply, "How very quiet the school library is!"

খ — Change the active "Students borrow books every day" to passive by making the object "books" the subject and using present simple passive: "Books are borrowed by students every day." You can also omit the agent if context makes it clear: "Books are borrowed every day."

গ — The positive degree is the base form of an adjective without comparative or superlative. The comparative "better" becomes the positive "good." So "This library is better than the old one" → "This library is good." (You may add context: "This library is good compared to others," but the key change is removing the comparative form.)

ঘ — To convert a declarative sentence in simple present into a yes/no question, use the auxiliary "do/does" + base verb. Subject "everyone" (third-person singular) requires "Does": "Does everyone read quietly in the library?"

Question:
Notes on environment action in the town: People are joining drives to plant trees, scientists raise alarms about climate risks, and citizens talk about pollution.

Options:
ক. The air pollution in the city is alarming. (Exclamatory)
খ. People are planting trees to improve the environment. (Passive)
গ. Climate change is a serious global problem. (Comparative)
ঘ. Many scientists warn about future risks. (Interrogative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক How alarming the air pollution in the city is!

খ Trees are being planted by people to improve the environment.

গ Climate change is more serious than many other environmental issues.

ঘ Do many scientists warn about future risks?

Explanation:
ক — Turn the statement into an exclamation to show strong feeling. From "The air pollution in the city is alarming," we can say "How alarming the air pollution in the city is!" (or "What alarming air pollution there is in the city!").

খ — The active progressive "are planting" becomes passive progressive "are being planted." Thus: "Trees are being planted by people to improve the environment." This preserves the continuous/progressive aspect.

গ — To form a comparative sentence from a positive statement, compare the subject with something else using "more/less" + adjective (for multi-syllable adjectives like "serious"). Example: "Climate change is more serious than many other environmental issues." This explicitly compares seriousness.

ঘ — For a simple present declarative converted to a yes/no question, use "do/does" + base verb. "Many scientists warn about future risks" becomes "Do many scientists warn about future risks?" If you prefer a question-word form, you could ask "Why do many scientists warn about future risks?" but the instruction asked for an interrogative form.

Question:
In a quiet mountain hamlet there lived an old potter who shaped delicate clay into lasting vessels. The villagers admired his skill and often called him a master craftsman. He put a lot of effort into every piece he made. His neighbor was a young apprentice who wished to learn from him.

Options:
ক. Make the first sentence simple.
খ. Make the second sentence passive.
গ. Make the third sentence comparative.
ঘ. Make the fourth sentence compound.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Once in a mountain hamlet there lived an old potter.
খ His skill was admired by the villagers and he was often called a master craftsman.
গ He put more effort into every piece than the other potters did.
ঘ His neighbor was a young apprentice, and he wished to learn from the potter.

Explanation:
ক — The original sentence contained a relative clause (who shaped delicate clay into lasting vessels). To make it simple, remove the subordinate clause while keeping the main idea: "Once in a mountain hamlet there lived an old potter." This leaves a single independent clause.

খ — The original is active: "The villagers admired his skill and often called him a master craftsman." To form the passive voice, promote the object(s) to subject position and add the appropriate form of 'be' + past participle: "His skill was admired by the villagers" and "he was often called a master craftsman." Joining them with 'and' preserves the original meaning.

গ — The original expresses effort but not explicitly as a comparison. To make it comparative, introduce a comparative structure using 'more ... than' or '-er than': "He put more effort into every piece than the other potters did." This compares his effort with that of other potters.

ঘ — The original sentence is a single clause with a relative clause: "His neighbor was a young apprentice who wished to learn from him." To make a compound sentence, split into two independent clauses and join with a coordinating conjunction: "His neighbor was a young apprentice, and he wished to learn from the potter." This yields two balanced independent clauses connected by 'and'.

Question:
A brilliant astronomer named Aisha discovered an unexpected streak in the night sky. She wrote about the observation in her log and shared it with colleagues. The streak looked brighter than any meteor she had previously seen. Soon the observatory director announced the finding to the press.

Options:
ক. Make the first sentence exclamatory.
খ. Make the second sentence passive.
গ. Make the third sentence simple.
ঘ. Make the fourth sentence complex.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক What an astonishing streak Aisha discovered in the night sky!
খ The observation was written in her log and was shared with colleagues by her.
গ The streak appeared very bright.
ঘ When the director confirmed the discovery, he announced it to the press.

Explanation:
ক — To change a declarative sentence into an exclamatory one, express surprise or strong feeling, often starting with "What" or "How" and using an exclamation mark: "What an astonishing streak Aisha discovered in the night sky!"

খ — The active sentence "She wrote about the observation in her log and shared it with colleagues" can be converted to passive by making the object ('the observation') the subject and using 'be' + past participle. For coordinated verbs, we applied passive to both: "The observation was written in her log and was shared with colleagues by her." This preserves the original actions in passive form.

গ — The original comparative phrase "brighter than any meteor she had previously seen" can be simplified to a basic descriptive statement: "The streak appeared very bright." This removes the comparative clause and yields a simple sentence.

ঘ — To make the director's announcement sentence complex, we add a subordinate clause that shows time or condition: "When the director confirmed the discovery, he announced it to the press." This combines a dependent clause (When ... confirmed) with the main clause (he announced ...), forming a complex sentence.

Question:
A team of students prepared a creative science fair project. They built a small robot that could sort colored blocks. The robot performed better than their previous prototype. Their teacher applauded their effort and offered helpful suggestions.

Options:
ক. Make the first sentence compound.
খ. Make the second sentence passive.
গ. Make the third sentence comparative (use a different comparative phrasing).
ঘ. Turn the fourth sentence into an interrogative sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক A team of students prepared a creative science fair project, and they spent many late evenings working on it.
খ A small robot that could sort colored blocks was built by them.
গ The robot was superior to their previous prototype in performance.
ঘ Did their teacher applaud their effort and offer helpful suggestions?

Explanation:
ক — To create a compound sentence, join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction. The original single clause can be extended with a related independent clause: "A team of students prepared a creative science fair project, and they spent many late evenings working on it." This yields a compound sentence.

খ — The active sentence "They built a small robot that could sort colored blocks" becomes passive by promoting the object to subject and using 'be' + past participle: "A small robot that could sort colored blocks was built by them." The relative clause describing the robot remains attached.

গ — The original comparative "performed better than their previous prototype" can be restated with different comparative phrasing such as 'superior to': "The robot was superior to their previous prototype in performance." This keeps the comparative meaning while changing wording.

ঘ — To turn a declarative sentence into an interrogative, invert the auxiliary verb and the subject or add an appropriate auxiliary. The declarative "Their teacher applauded their effort and offered helpful suggestions." becomes a yes/no question: "Did their teacher applaud their effort and offer helpful suggestions?" This asks for confirmation of the actions.

Question:
Punctuality is a valuable habit for students and professionals. Transform the sentences below as instructed.

Options:
ক. Make the following a simple sentence: "Because he is punctual, he manages to finish his work before the deadline."
খ. Change the following into a complex sentence: "She arrives early and gets a good seat."
গ. Change the following into passive voice: "Teachers appreciate punctual students."
ঘ. Combine the two sentences into a compound sentence using 'but': "He was late yesterday. He aims to be punctual."


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক He is punctual and manages to finish his work before the deadline. খ Since she arrives early, she gets a good seat. গ Punctual students are appreciated by teachers. ঘ He was late yesterday, but he aims to be punctual.

Explanation:
ক: The complex clause 'Because he is punctual, ...' is expressed in a single independent clause with a compound predicate to make the idea simple and direct: single subject + compound verb phrase (is punctual and manages...). This keeps all necessary information without subordinate clauses. 

খ: To form a complex sentence we introduce a subordinating conjunction ('Since') to make one clause dependent: 'Since she arrives early' (dependent) + 'she gets a good seat' (main). This shows cause-effect in one complex sentence. 

গ: Passive voice is formed by making the object ('punctual students') the subject and using the appropriate form of 'to be' + past participle: 'are appreciated' + agent optional 'by teachers'. 

ঘ: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses of related meaning with a coordinating conjunction 'but' because the second clause contrasts the first. We link them with a comma before 'but' to form a correct compound sentence.

Honesty builds trust among friends and colleagues. Perform the sentence transformations indicated below.

Options:
ক. Convert to a simple sentence: "If you are honest, people will trust you."
খ. Turn into a complex sentence: "He tells the truth and gains respect."
গ. Convert to passive voice: "People admire an honest person."
ঘ. Express the idea in a positive/general form: "An honest person is more respected than a dishonest person."


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Honesty makes people trust you. খ Because he tells the truth, he gains respect. গ An honest person is admired by people. ঘ Honesty brings respect.

Explanation:
ক: The conditional sentence is converted to a simple declarative by expressing the general truth as a single idea: 'Honesty makes people trust you.' This removes the if-clause while preserving meaning. 

খ: To make a complex sentence, add a subordinating conjunction ('Because') to show cause: 'Because he tells the truth' (dependent) + 'he gains respect' (main). This links the action and consequence in a subordinate structure. 

গ: Passive construction places 'an honest person' as the subject and uses 'is admired' (to be + past participle) with the agent optional ('by people'). 

ঘ: Turning the comparative sentence into a positive/general statement removes the explicit comparison and states the underlying principle: 'Honesty brings respect.' This general form expresses the same idea in a positive, non-comparative way.

খ. Change into a complex sentence: "He cleans the house daily and stays healthy."
গ. Change into passive voice: "The community maintains the park regularly."

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Do they keep their surroundings clean? খ Because he cleans the house daily, he stays healthy. গ The park is maintained regularly by the community. ঘ She keeps her room clean, so she avoids illnesses.

Explanation:
ক: To form an interrogative in the simple present, invert the auxiliary 'do' with the subject: 'Do they keep...' This is the standard yes/no question form for plural subjects in present simple. 

খ: Creating a complex sentence uses a subordinating conjunction ('Because') to link cause and effect: 'Because he cleans the house daily' (dependent) + 'he stays healthy' (main). 

গ: Passive voice shifts the object 'the park' to subject position and uses 'is maintained' (to be + past participle), adding the agent 'by the community' if desired. 

ঘ: A compound sentence is formed by joining two related independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction 'so' to show result: clause 1, 'so' clause 2. A comma is used before 'so' when it joins two independent clauses.

Options:
ক. Transform into a complex sentence: 'The musician is performing on the stage.' (complex)
খ. Change to passive voice: 'They invited many artists to the festival.' (passive)
গ. Make a comparative sentence: 'This concert is enjoyable.' (comparative)
ঘ. Convert to an exclamatory sentence: 'She gave a great performance.' (exclamatory)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The musician is performing on the stage because he loves entertaining people.

খ Many artists were invited to the festival.

গ This concert is more enjoyable than the previous one.

ঘ What a great performance she gave!

Explanation:
ক: A complex sentence contains an independent clause and at least one subordinate clause. Adding a subordinating conjunction or clause (e.g., 'because he loves entertaining people') converts the simple sentence into a complex sentence while keeping the original idea.

খ: To form the passive voice, the object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence. 'They invited many artists to the festival' -> 'Many artists were invited to the festival.' (Auxiliary 'were' + past participle 'invited'). The agent 'by them' is optional.

গ: A comparative sentence compares two things. The adjective 'enjoyable' takes a comparative form by using 'more' before it. Adding a second item for comparison (e.g., 'than the previous one') completes the comparative construction: 'more enjoyable than...'.

ঘ: Exclamatory sentences express strong emotion. One common pattern is 'What a/an + adjective + noun + subject + verb!' So 'She gave a great performance.' becomes 'What a great performance she gave!' or alternatively, 'How brilliantly she performed!' Both convey strong feeling and are exclamatory.

Options:
ক. Join into a compound sentence: 'They planted saplings in the park.' and 'Children watered them.' (compound)
খ. Change to passive voice: 'The volunteers will clean the river bank tomorrow.' (passive)
গ. Make a comparative sentence: 'This year's drive was successful.' (comparative)
ঘ. Transform into a complex sentence: 'They planted trees before the festival.' (complex)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক They planted saplings in the park, and the children watered them.

খ The river bank will be cleaned by the volunteers tomorrow.

গ This year's drive was more successful than last year's.

ঘ They planted trees before the festival began.

Explanation:
ক: A compound sentence links two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). Here we join the two statements with 'and' and a comma: '..., and ...'.

খ: In passive construction the object becomes the subject. 'The volunteers will clean the river bank tomorrow' -> 'The river bank will be cleaned by the volunteers tomorrow.' Structure: subject + auxiliary 'will be' + past participle.

গ: To make a comparative sentence, compare this year's drive with another reference (e.g., last year's). Use 'more' + adjective for multi-syllable adjectives or ' -er' for short adjectives. 'More successful than last year's' is the natural comparative form.

ঘ: A complex sentence contains a main clause and a subordinate clause. By adding a subordinating time-clause 'before the festival began', the sentence becomes complex while preserving the temporal relationship: 'They planted trees before the festival began.'

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The students' projects were presented to the judges.

খ Ria's model is more accurate than Ali's model.

গ The judges praised the projects, and they gave suggestions for improvement.

ঘ What a brilliant experiment he conducted!

Explanation:
ক: Passive voice makes the object of the active sentence the subject of the passive sentence. 'Students presented their projects to the judges' -> 'The students' projects were presented to the judges.' (Note: 'by the students' can be added if explicit agent is needed.)

খ: Comparative sentences require a basis for comparison. Adding a second item ('Ali's model') and using 'more' with the adjective 'accurate' yields: 'more accurate than...'. Short adjectives sometimes take '-er', but 'accurate' is better with 'more'.

গ: Combine the two independent clauses using a coordinating conjunction. Use a comma before 'and' when connecting two independent clauses: '..., and ...'. This yields a compound sentence.

ঘ: To make an exclamatory sentence from a declarative one, use patterns such as 'What a/an + adjective + noun + subject + verb!' So 'He conducted a brilliant experiment.' becomes 'What a brilliant experiment he conducted!' which expresses strong admiration.

Question:
A teacher addressing a class about the value of learning, character and examination preparation.

Options:
ক. Knowledge is power. (make it complex)
খ. A student without character cannot be truly educated. (make it positive)
গ. A disciplined student helps his classmates. A lazy one drags them down. (make it compound)
ঘ. He will pass the exam. (make it interrogative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Knowledge is power because it empowers individuals to make informed choices and change their circumstances.
খ Only a student who possesses good character can be considered truly educated.
গ A disciplined student helps his classmates, but a lazy one drags them down.
ঘ Will he pass the exam?

Explanation:
ক: To make the simple sentence complex, add a subordinate clause that explains or qualifies why knowledge is power. The conjunction "because" introduces a dependent clause giving reason, creating a complex sentence.

খ: The original has a negative structure (without ... cannot). To make it positive, rephrase so the affirmation is explicit: "Only a student who possesses good character can be considered truly educated." This removes negation and preserves meaning.

গ: Two short independent sentences are combined into one compound sentence using the coordinating conjunction "but" to show contrast between the two types of students. Punctuation: a comma before 'but' is standard when joining independent clauses.

ঘ: Turning a declarative sentence into an interrogative requires subject–auxiliary inversion. The auxiliary "will" moves before the subject "he" to form a yes/no question: "Will he pass the exam?"

Question:
A counselor speaking to young professionals about managing time and achieving goals.

Options:
ক. Time lost never returns. (make it complex)
খ. Procrastination makes tasks harder. (make it positive)
গ. He worked hard. He achieved his goal. (make it compound)
ঘ. They can finish the project on time. (make it interrogative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Time that is lost never returns, so we must value every moment we have.
খ Acting promptly makes tasks easier and more manageable.
গ He worked hard, and therefore he achieved his goal.
ঘ Can they finish the project on time?

Explanation:
ক: Convert the simple aphorism into a complex sentence by adding a relative clause or a dependent clause. "Time that is lost never returns" uses a relative clause ("that is lost") to make it complex; adding "so we must value every moment" further expands it with cause and consequence.

খ: Replace the negative implication of procrastination causing difficulty with a positive counterpart. Instead of saying what makes things worse, state the constructive action and its benefit: "Acting promptly makes tasks easier." This affirms desirable behavior.

গ: Two independent simple sentences are joined into a compound sentence with the coordinating conjunction "and" (or "so/therefore") to show the logical relationship between effort and result. A comma is used before the conjunction when joining independent clauses.

ঘ: Change the declarative modal statement into an interrogative by placing the modal verb before the subject: "Can they... ?" This forms a direct question about ability or possibility.

Question:
A community organizer talking about public health measures and collective responsibility.

Options:
ক. Clean water saves lives. (make it complex)
খ. The poor community lacks sanitation. (make it positive)
গ. People maintain hygiene. Diseases spread less. (make it compound)
ঘ. We must act now. (make it interrogative)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Clean water saves lives because it prevents the spread of waterborne diseases and supports overall health.
খ The community will benefit from improved sanitation facilities and practices.
গ People maintain hygiene, and as a result, diseases spread less.
ঘ Must we act now?

Explanation:
ক: To make the sentence complex, add a subordinate clause explaining how or why clean water has the stated effect. Using "because" introduces a cause that turns the simple sentence into a complex one.

খ: The original is framed negatively (lacks). To create a positive formulation, focus on the constructive outcome or need: state the improvement or benefit instead of the deficiency. "The community will benefit from improved sanitation facilities and practices" affirms a positive change.

গ: Two short statements are combined into a compound sentence using the coordinating conjunction "and" (or "and as a result") to show a relationship between the two independent clauses; this links hygienic behavior with reduced disease transmission.

ঘ: Turn the imperative/declarative into an interrogative that asks about necessity or urgency by placing the modal verb "must" before the subject: "Must we act now?" This expresses the same urgency as a question.

Question:
Sofia rents a tiny studio in downtown Vancouver. Her husband Amir is fond of photography. Vancouver attracts many tourists each year. Their friends rarely visit during weekdays.

Options:
ক. Rewrite the first sentence as a complex sentence. (complex)
খ. Rewrite the second sentence in the negative form. (negative)
গ. Change the third sentence into an interrogative sentence. (interrogative)
ঘ. Change the fourth sentence into the passive voice. (passive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Although Sofia rents a tiny studio in downtown Vancouver, she appreciates its convenience and proximity to shops and transit.

খ Her husband Amir is not fond of photography.

গ Does Vancouver attract many tourists each year?

ঘ During weekdays, their house is rarely visited by their friends.

Explanation:
ক: To make the simple sentence complex, combine it with a subordinate clause (here an adverbial clause of contrast or reason). The conjunction 'although' introduces the subordinate clause and keeps the main idea intact.

খ: Forming the negative uses the appropriate auxiliary plus 'not'. For a simple present affirmative with 'is', insert 'not' after the verb: 'is not'.

গ: To form a yes/no question in the simple present for a non-third-person singular subject or a third-person singular subject, use the auxiliary 'do/does'. Here 'Vancouver' is third-person singular, so use 'Does' + subject + base verb.

ঘ: To convert into passive voice, make the object of the active sentence the grammatical subject of the passive sentence and use the appropriate form of 'be' + past participle. Since 'their friends rarely visit (them/their house)', we rephrase naturally as 'their house is rarely visited by their friends' to maintain clarity and natural word order.

Question:
Miguel shares a cozy flat in Lisbon with his sister Lucia. Lucia enjoys painting in the evenings. Lisbon's sea views are famous worldwide. Tourists often underestimate local customs.

Options:
ক. Combine the first sentence into a compound sentence. (compound)
খ. Rewrite the second sentence in the negative form. (negative)
গ. Turn the third sentence into a question. (interrogative)
ঘ. Convert the fourth sentence into the passive voice. (passive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Miguel shares a cozy flat in Lisbon with his sister Lucia, and they split the rent and household chores.

খ Lucia does not enjoy painting in the evenings.

গ Are Lisbon's sea views famous worldwide?

ঘ Local customs are often underestimated by tourists.

Explanation:
ক: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, so). Here we add a related independent clause about sharing responsibilities to form a natural compound sentence.

খ: To negate a present-tense action for a third-person singular subject ('Lucia'), use 'does not' + base verb: 'does not enjoy'.

গ: For a yes/no question in the simple present about third-person singular ('Lisbon's sea views'), use 'Are' because the subject 'sea views' is plural.

ঘ: Passive voice formation moves the object to the subject position and uses 'be' + past participle. 'Tourists underestimate local customs' becomes 'Local customs are often underestimated by tourists.' This preserves meaning and natural emphasis on 'local customs.'

Question:
Elena lives in a compact apartment in Athens. Her neighbor Kostas likes playing loud music. Athens has a rich historical heritage. Occasionally her cousins come to visit without warning.

Options:
ক. Change the first sentence into a complex sentence. (complex)
খ. Rewrite the second sentence in the negative form. (negative)
গ. Make the third sentence into an interrogative. (interrogative)
ঘ. Change the fourth sentence into passive voice. (passive)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Although Elena lives in a compact apartment in Athens, she enjoys the city's vibrant streets and ancient sites.

খ Her neighbor Kostas does not like playing loud music.

গ Does Athens have a rich historical heritage?

ঘ Occasionally, unannounced visits are paid by her cousins.

Explanation:
ক: To form a complex sentence, introduce a subordinate clause that contrasts or explains the main clause (for example, using 'although'). This links the compact living situation with Elena's positive feeling about the city.

খ: Negation for third-person singular present uses 'does not' + base verb: 'does not like'. This directly negates the original statement.

গ: For an interrogative in the simple present about 'Athens' (third-person singular), use 'Does' + subject + base verb 'have'.

ঘ: Passive conversion often requires rephrasing for naturalness. 'Her cousins come to visit without warning' can be rendered passively as 'unannounced visits are paid by her cousins' or 'visits are made by her cousins without warning', both of which use a form of 'be' (are) plus past participle (paid/made) and include the agent introduced by 'by.'

Question:
Read the following short remarks about honesty and truthfulness. Transform each given sentence as instructed.

Options:
ক. বাক্য (a) 'Honesty leads to respect.' — এটিকে নেতিবাচক বাক্যে রূপান্তর করো।
খ. বাক্য (b) 'He who lies loses trust.' — এটিকে প্রশ্নবাচক বাক্যে রূপান্তর করো।
গ. বাক্য (c) 'Do not hide the truth.' — এটিকে passive voice-এ রূপান্তর করো।
ঘ. বাক্য (d) 'Truth helps maintain good relations.' — এটিকে compound sentence-এ রূপান্তর করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Honesty does not lead to disrespect.

খ Does he who lies lose trust?

গ The truth should not be hidden.

ঘ Truth helps maintain good relations, so people who practise it are trusted by others.

Explanation:
ক: মূল বাক্যটি ইতিবাচক; নেতিবাচক করতে 'not' বা 'does not' ব্যবহার করতে হবে। 'Honesty leads to respect' → 'Honesty does not lead to disrespect' বা তালবদ্ধ নেতিবাচক রূপে 'Honesty does not lead to disrespect' ব্যবহার করা যায়। এখানে 'disrespect' ব্যবহার করে অর্থ বিপরীত করা হয়েছে।

খ: প্রশ্নবাচক রূপ করতে সাধারণত auxiliary verb (does/did) ব্যবহার করা হয়। present simple-এ subject 'he who lies' থাকায় 'Does he who lies lose trust?' হবে সঠিক প্রশ্নবাচক রূপ।

গ: নির্দেশনামূলক ('Do not hide the truth') বাক্যের passive রূপে অনুরোধ/পরামর্শকে প্রকাশ করতে 'should not be hidden' ব্যবহার করা যায়: 'The truth should not be hidden.' এটি নিয়মিত passive রূপ যা অর্থ ধরে রাখে।

ঘ: compound sentence-এর জন্য দুটি স্বতন্ত্র clause কে conjunction দ্বারা যুক্ত করতে হবে। 'Truth helps maintain good relations' কে 'so', 'and', 'therefore' ইত্যাদি দিয়ে যুক্ত করে একটি compound sentence তৈরি করা হয়েছে: 'Truth helps maintain good relations, so people who practise it are trusted by others.' এতে দুটি স্বাধীন clause রয়েছে এবং সম্পর্ক স্পষ্ট হয়েছে।

Question:
Consider these remarks about time and its value. Convert each sentence as directed.

Options:
ক. বাক্য (a) 'Time waits for no one.' — এটিকে প্রশ্নবাচক বাক্যে রূপান্তর করো।
খ. বাক্য (b) 'We waste time by procrastinating.' — এটিকে নেতিবাচক বাক্যে রূপান্তর করো।
গ. বাক্য (c) 'Make every moment count.' — এটিকে passive voice-এ রূপান্তর করো।
ঘ. বাক্য (d) 'Lost time cannot be regained.' — এটিকে compound sentence-এ রূপান্তর করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Does time wait for anyone?

খ We do not make good use of time when we procrastinate.

গ Every moment should be made to count.

ঘ Lost time cannot be regained, so we must use our hours wisely.

Explanation:
ক: 'Time waits for no one' থেকে প্রশ্নবাচক করতে auxiliary 'does' ব্যবহার করে উপযুক্ত word order লাগে: 'Does time wait for anyone?' (এখানে 'anyone' ব্যবহার করে নেগেটিভ অর্থের বিপরীত প্রশ্ন করা হয়েছে)।

খ: নেতিবাচক রূপ তৈরিতে মূল বাক্যের অর্থ বজায় রেখে 'do not' বা অন্য উপযুক্ত negation ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে: 'We do not make good use of time when we procrastinate.' এই বাক্যটি মূল বক্তব্যকে নেতিবাচকভাবে প্রকাশ করে।

গ: 'Make every moment count' একটি আদেশ/অনুরোধ; এর passive রূপে সাধারণ পরামর্শবোধক passive 'should be made to count' ব্যবহার করা সাতীকা: 'Every moment should be made to count.' এটি আদেশের passive রূপের মতো এবং স্বাভাবিক শৈলীতে মেনে নেওয়া যায়।

ঘ: compound sentence তৈরির জন্য একটি যুক্তি বা ফলাফলের clause যোগ করা হয়েছে: 'Lost time cannot be regained, so we must use our hours wisely.' এতে দুটি স্বাধীন clause আছে এবং 'so' শব্দটি তাদের সম্পর্ক বোঝাচ্ছে।

Think about these short observations on knowledge and generosity. Make the requested transformations.

Options:
ক. বাক্য (a) 'Knowledge grows when shared.' — এটিকে নেতিবাচক বাক্যে রূপান্তর করো।
খ. বাক্য (b) 'She gave her notes to the students.' — এটিকে প্রশ্নবাচক বাক্যে রূপান্তর করো।
গ. বাক্য (c) 'Never stop learning.' — এটিকে সহজ (simple declarative) বাক্যে রূপান্তর করো।
ঘ. বাক্য (d) 'A generous person earns respect.' — এটিকে passive voice-এ রূপান্তর করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Knowledge does not grow unless it is shared.

খ Did she give her notes to the students?

গ One should never stop learning.

ঘ Respect is earned by a generous person.

Explanation:
ক: নেতিবাচক রূপে 'unless' বা 'if not' ব্যবহার করে মূল অর্থ বজায় রাখা যায়: 'Knowledge does not grow unless it is shared.' এটি বলে যে ভাগ না করলে জ্ঞান বৃদ্ধি পায় না — মূল বক্তব্যের নেতিবাচক রূপ।

খ: past simple বাক্যের প্রশ্নবাচক রূপে 'did' auxiliary ব্যবহার করতে হয়: 'Did she give her notes to the students?' এটি সরল, সরাসরি প্রশ্নবাচক রূপ।

গ: আদেশ/নির্দেশ 'Never stop learning' কে সাধারণ ঘোষণামূলক বাক্যে রূপান্তর করতে কোন subject যোগ করলে বাক্য simple declarative হয়: 'One should never stop learning.' এখানে 'One' generic subject এবং 'should' পরামর্শসূচক।

ঘ: active থেকে passive-এ রূপান্তরের সময় object-ko subject করা হয়: 'A generous person earns respect.' → 'Respect is earned by a generous person.' এটি standard passive রূপ যা অর্থ অপরিবর্তিত রেখে বাক্যকে passive করেছে।

Question:
Read the short passage about urban air quality. (a) Smoke from chimneys and vehicles fills the city sky. (b) People often burn trash in open spaces which harms the environment. (c) During festivals, bursts of firecrackers are heard and colourful smoke rises. (d) The factory emissions were measured by the environmental agency last month. (e) When winds blow, the polluted air spreads to neighbouring towns.

Options:
ক. Which sentence is a complex sentence?
খ. Which sentence is in passive voice?
গ. Which sentence is compound?
ঘ. Convert sentence (d) into active voice.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: (e) When winds blow, the polluted air spreads to neighbouring towns.

খ Answer: (d) The factory emissions were measured by the environmental agency last month.

গ Answer: (b) People often burn trash in open spaces which harms the environment. (This is a compound-complex structure; the main clause and a relative/subordinate clause are combined; however if you consider purely compound: none of the sentences have two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction — so (b) functions as compound-complex because it links actions.)

ঘ Answer: Active voice of (d): The environmental agency measured the factory emissions last month.

Explanation:
ক (complex): Sentence (e) begins with the subordinate/time clause "When winds blow," and contains the main clause "the polluted air spreads to neighbouring towns." Presence of the dependent clause makes it a complex sentence.

খ (passive): Sentence (d) uses the passive construction "were measured" and places the object "The factory emissions" as the grammatical subject, while the agent "the environmental agency" follows. This is a clear passive voice form.

গ (compound): Sentence (b) "People often burn trash in open spaces which harms the environment." contains a main clause "People often burn trash in open spaces" and a relative/subordinate clause "which harms the environment." This gives it more than one clause; although strictly speaking it is compound-complex rather than a simple compound sentence. If strictly asked for a pure compound (two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction) none of the given sentences is a textbook example; (b) best fits the multi-clause category.

ঘ (conversion to active): To change passive to active, make the agent the subject and adjust the verb: "The environmental agency measured the factory emissions last month." The tense and time expression are preserved while the verb becomes active.

Question:
Consider these statements about soil contamination. (a) Farmers add chemical fertilizers and pesticides to get better yields. (b) Rainwater washes some of these chemicals into nearby streams. (c) Many people throw plastic and non-biodegradable waste on the ground. (d) The contaminated land was declared unsafe by the municipal council. (e) As microbes decompose organic matter, the soil becomes richer in nutrients.

Options:
ক. Which sentence is a simple sentence?
খ. Which sentence is written in passive voice?
গ. Turn sentence (c) into passive voice.
ঘ. Which sentence is complex and why?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: (a) Farmers add chemical fertilizers and pesticides to get better yields.

খ Answer: (d) The contaminated land was declared unsafe by the municipal council.

গ Answer: Passive form of (c): Plastic and non-biodegradable waste is thrown on the ground by many people. (Or: Many plastics and non-biodegradable wastes are thrown on the ground.)

ঘ Answer: (e) As microbes decompose organic matter, the soil becomes richer in nutrients. This is complex because it contains a subordinate clause "As microbes decompose organic matter" (showing time/cause) and a main clause "the soil becomes richer in nutrients."

Explanation:
ক (simple): Sentence (a) has a single independent clause with a single subject "Farmers" and a predicate "add chemical fertilizers and pesticides to get better yields." There is no subordinate clause, so it is a simple sentence.

খ (passive): Sentence (d) uses the passive construction "was declared"; the subject "The contaminated land" receives the action, while the agent "the municipal council" is introduced by "by." That marks passive voice.

গ (conversion): To form passive from active, make the object the subject, use the appropriate form of "be" + past participle, and optionally add the agent with "by." Active: "Many people throw plastic and non-biodegradable waste on the ground." Passive: "Plastic and non-biodegradable waste is thrown on the ground by many people." Ensure subject-verb agreement (singular/plural) depending on noun phrasing.

ঘ (complex): Sentence (e) includes a dependent clause "As microbes decompose organic matter" that cannot stand alone and a main clause "the soil becomes richer in nutrients." Presence of the subordinate clause makes the sentence complex.

(c) Lights from the shore confuse migrating birds and turtles. (d) The authorities have cleaned many beaches every summer for years.

Options:
ক. Which sentence is compound?
খ. Which sentence is a simple sentence?
গ. Change sentence (e) into passive voice.
ঘ. Which sentence contains an adjective (relative) clause or a subordinate clause functioning like one? Explain.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: (a) Fishermen accidentally drop nets and gear that choke marine life.

খ Answer: (b) Sewage pipes often spill untreated waste into the bay.

গ Answer: Passive form of (e): Debris and chemicals are driven into deeper waters when storms surge.

ঘ Answer: (a) contains a relative clause "that choke marine life." This clause modifies "nets and gear" and functions as an adjective clause.

Explanation:
ক (compound): Sentence (a) has a main clause "Fishermen accidentally drop nets and gear" and a relative/adjective clause "that choke marine life." While strictly it is a complex sentence because of the relative clause, in the sense of multiple clause structure it joins two ideas; if asked for a pure compound (two independent clauses joined by a conjunction), none of the sentences is a textbook compound. Sentence (a) is best highlighted because it contains more than one clause.

খ (simple): Sentence (b) "Sewage pipes often spill untreated waste into the bay." has a single independent clause with no subordinate clauses, so it is a simple sentence.

গ (passive conversion): To change (e) to passive, promote the object "debris and chemicals" to subject position and use appropriate passive verb form: "Debris and chemicals are driven into deeper waters when storms surge." The temporal clause "when storms surge" remains as a subordinate clause that indicates time.

ঘ (adjective/relative clause): Sentence (a) includes "that choke marine life," which is a relative clause modifying "nets and gear." Relative clauses function like adjectives, giving more information about a noun; therefore it is the clause requested.

Options:
ক. Compound sentence করে দাও।
খ. Complex sentence করে দাও।
গ. Simple sentence করে দাও।
ঘ. Passive voice করে দাও।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Maya gave up her locket, and Arif sold his watch so that they could buy anniversary presents for each other.

খ Because they wanted to surprise one another, Maya and Arif gave up their favorite belongings to buy anniversary presents.

গ Maya and Arif sacrificed their favorite belongings for anniversary presents.

ঘ Their favorite belongings were given up by Maya and Arif so that anniversary presents could be bought for each other.

Explanation:
ক (Compound): A compound sentence joins two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, so). I split the idea into two main clauses (Maya gave up her locket) and (Arif sold his watch) and joined them with 'and', adding the purpose phrase.

খ (Complex): A complex sentence uses a subordinate clause. I introduced a subordinate adverbial clause of reason/purpose (Because they wanted to surprise one another) plus the main clause describing their sacrifice.

গ (Simple): A simple sentence contains a single independent clause. I condensed the idea into one clause with one subject compound (Maya and Arif) and one verb (sacrificed) and the object.

ঘ (Passive): To form the passive, I made the object of the active sentence (their favorite belongings) the subject of the passive sentence and included the agents (by Maya and Arif) and the purpose phrase. Passive emphasizes the belongings rather than the doers.

খ. Compound sentence হিসেবে লিখো।
গ. Passive voice এ রূপান্তর করো।
ঘ. Interrogative (প্রশ্নবাচক) করে লিখো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Rafi saved his meager pocket money for several months so that he could buy his mother a new frying pan.

খ Rafi saved his meager pocket money for several months, and he finally bought his mother a new frying pan.

গ A new frying pan was bought for his mother by Rafi after he had saved his meager pocket money for several months.

ঘ Did Rafi save his meager pocket money for several months to buy his mother a new frying pan?

Explanation:
ক (Complex): The sentence already expresses purpose; a complex sentence can include a purpose (so that/ in order that) clause. I used 'so that he could buy...' as the subordinate clause.

খ (Compound): I created two independent clauses linked by 'and': one about saving, the other about the result (buying the pan). This fits the compound structure.

গ (Passive): The active verb phrase 'bought his mother a new frying pan' becomes passive: the pan (object) becomes the subject. I preserved the time/detail phrase and included the agent 'by Rafi'.

ঘ (Interrogative): To form a question, I inverted the auxiliary/modal structure: 'Did Rafi save...' This asks the same basic idea in question form. If spoken, intonation or a question mark indicates interrogative.

Options:
ক. Compound sentence বানাও।
খ. Complex sentence বানাও।
গ. Passive voice এ লিখো।
ঘ. Superlative 'most industrious' কে positive degree এ রূপান্তর করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Mrs. Karim praised little Saba, and she called her the most industrious pupil in the class.

খ Because she observed Saba's steady effort, Mrs. Karim praised the little girl as the most industrious pupil in the class.

গ Little Saba was praised by Mrs. Karim as the most industrious pupil in the class after her steady effort was observed.

ঘ Mrs. Karim praised little Saba, calling her industrious.

Explanation:
ক (Compound): I split the idea into two independent clauses — the act of praising and the naming — and joined them with 'and'. Both clauses can stand alone, so the sentence is compound.

খ (Complex): I used a subordinate clause of reason ('Because she observed Saba's steady effort') followed by the main clause of praise, forming a complex sentence.

গ (Passive): The active sentence 'Mrs. Karim praised little Saba...' becomes passive by making 'Little Saba' the subject followed by the passive verb 'was praised' and including the agent 'by Mrs. Karim'. I also converted the participial detail into passive form for consistency.

ঘ (Positive degree): Converting the superlative 'the most industrious' to the positive degree removes the comparison: 'industrious'. I rephrased to 'calling her industrious' to keep natural English while expressing the same compliment without a comparative/superlative degree.
