There I became acquainted (e) _____a boy named Jerry.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
a Use "in" because we say "in" with seasons and general times (e.g., "in autumn").  
b Use "away" as part of the phrasal verb "blow away," meaning to remove or disperse (so mountain air to blow away malaria).  
c Use "for" because "homesick for" is the correct collocation to express longing for something.  
d Use "to" because "belong to" is the correct verb + preposition combination showing possession.  
e Use "with" because "acquainted with" is the standard phrase meaning to know or be introduced to someone.

Dear Ruma

I have just heard (a)_____your brother that you have been ill (b)_____ the hospital (c) _____the last two weeks. I am very sorry, I should have written (d)_____time. I. hope you will come (e)_____soon.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) from, (b) in, (c) for, (d) in, (e) home. These fit because "heard from" means receiving news from someone; "in the hospital" shows the place where she was ill; "for the last two weeks" expresses duration; "in time" means earlier/without delay (not "on time"); and "come home" is the natural phrase for returning from hospital.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: (a) "in" — the phrase "end in smoke" means to fail or come to nothing, so "did not end in smoke" is correct. (b) "in" — we say "succeed in (an examination/attempt)". (c) "about" — "glad about" is used to express being pleased regarding something. (d) "on" — we "congratulate someone on something".

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:

"For" indicates benefit or direction toward people ("noble for human beings"), and "hear from" is the fixed phrase meaning to receive news ("Waiting to hear from you").

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The best choices are: (a) "all of a sudden" because it expresses an unexpected event; (b) "at" since we say "throw stones at someone" to show the target; (c) "because of it" to show the frogs died as a result of that action; (d) "up" because "holding its head up" describes the frog’s posture while speaking; (e) "to" because "a cause of death to us" shows something causes harm to those affected.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: (a) "through" is used for moving via a place — "pass through Dhaka." (b) "with" fits the collocation "have a chat with someone." (c) "on" is the preposition used before days — "on the next Friday" (though "next Friday" can be used without "on"). (d) "at" is used for specific locations ("at my residence") and for time ("at noon"). (e) "with" is required because we "agree with" a plan.

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: 
(a) "of" is used in the phrase "the middle of April" to show which time period is meant. (b) "over" fits because the sun shines above or across the village. (c) "outside" describes the villagers’ location relative to their cottages (they were not inside). (d) "through" means walking across the park from one side to the other. (e) "over" is idiomatic for a bag resting on or across someone’s shoulder.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "you" — "ask someone a favour" requires an object, so "Can I ask you a favour?" is correct.  
(b) "for" — the second "for" shows purpose/time: "in Dhaka for a week for your aunties’ medical check-up."  
(c) "up" — "put someone up" means to provide accommodation, so "Can you put me up?" fits.  
(d) "up" — "turn up" means "arrive" or "come," so "We will turn up just two days after" = we'll arrive two days later.  
(e) "to" — "look forward to" is followed by a gerund, hence "to hearing from you soon."

Question:
Population growth is one (a) ————– the causes (b) ————- the world’s environmental problems. Although the growth rate (c)————- the world’s population has slowed slightly since the 1990s, still it increases (d) —————77 million human beings each year, (e) -———- the increasing number of people, destruction of habitats and the use of additional natural resources are gradually increasing.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) of
(b) of
(c) of
(d) by
(e) Due to

Here's the breakdown:

of : This preposition connects "population growth" to being "one of the causes" of environmental problems.
of : Connects "causes" to being "of the world's environmental problems."
of : Connects "growth rate" to being "of the world's population."
by : Shows the amount of increase with "increases" which is measured "by" 77 million.
Due to : Connects the reason for the gradual increase - "the increasing number of people, destruction of habitats and the use of additional natural resources."

Explanation:
Explanation: The best words are (a) "of", (b) "of", (c) "of", (d) "by", (e) "Consequently". "Of" shows the relationship/possession in phrases like "one of the causes" and "growth rate of the world's population," "by" indicates the amount of increase, and "Consequently" appropriately links the cause (population growth) to the resulting problems.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Answers: (a) in, (b) of, (c) around, (d) our, (e) into.  
"in" fits because we say "live in" to show location; "full of" is the correct collocation; "things around us" means nearby things. "Our" shows the environment belongs to us, and "turn ... into" is the phrasal verb meaning change into something else.

(c) for — "advice for you" expresses that the advice is intended for you (though "to you" is possible, "for you" is more natural here). (d) to — you "allot time to each subject" (allot + something + to someone/thing). (e) for — "for practice" shows the purpose of writing answers.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Use "in" for (a) because we say "first prize in a competition," and "on" for (b) because we speak "on the topic." "In brief" is a common phrase for (c) meaning "briefly," and "in" fits (d) since things are "available in" a language. "From" fits (e) because the fixed phrase is "aloof from" the civilized world.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
My dear Father,

My best regards to you and mother. I know you are worried about me and want to know how I am passing my life here. I feel quite at home. Our hostel manager takes care of us. I can pass my time happily and pay concentration to studies. I have become accustomed to my new hostel life.

Your loving son

Explanation:
(a) "about" — "worried about someone" is the correct collocation: the preposition "about" links "worried" to the person being worried over.  

(b) "at home" — the idiom "feel at home" means to be comfortable and relaxed, so "at" is required with "home."  

(c) "of" — "take care of" is a fixed phrasal verb meaning look after, so "of" is needed before the object "us."  

(d) "to" — verbs like "pay" use "to" to show the thing receiving attention (compare "pay attention to studies"), so "to studies" is correct.  

(e) "to" — "accustomed to" is the standard adjective + preposition combination, so "accustomed to my new hostel life" is correct.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) about, (b) off, (c) as much as, (d) upright, (e) beyond.

These fit common collocations and meaning: "about 2000 miles" shows an approximate distance and "off the western coast" means away from the coast. "Went far beyond its statues" correctly means the island’s mysteries were not limited to the statues. "Weighing as much as fifty tons" indicates the maximum weight, and "stood them upright"/stood them up expresses putting the statues in a vertical position.

Explanation:
Use "on" with "take pity" ("took pity on him"); "around" shows the snakes moving encircling the ship; "with" follows "filled" and "for" follows "love" ("filled with such a strange wonder", "a great love for them"). "In his heart" is the idiom for an internal feeling; the albatross "fell from his neck into the sea" shows movement away and into; a breeze comes "from the south" and one "falls into a deep sleep". Finally, "relieved of his sufferings" uses "of" to indicate what was removed—these choices follow common verb–preposition collocations and spatial/directional usage.

Corruption is described as something that affects a nation, so we use "to" after "curse" and "hindrance" to show that effect: (a) to, (b) to. "With" shows the presence of corrupt people and "in" denotes time period: (c) with, (d) in. Passive and fixed collocations require specific prepositions: "hated by" (e), "feeling for" (f), "devoid of" (g), "abide by" (h), "impact on" (i); and to oppose someone we say "stand against" (j).

He is satisfied (h) —------ what he has. But sometimes he runs into debt and poverty is responsible (i) —----- this debt. However, he does not like to depend (j) —------ others.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) as (b) to (c) from (d) of (e) for (f) after (g) by (h) with (1) for (1) on

Explanation:
Many of these blanks are fixed collocations (verb/adjective + preposition): we say "work as" for a role, "known to" someone, "suffer from" an ailment/condition and "deprived of" something. Similarly, desires and pursuits take specific prepositions ("long for", "hanker after"), means take "by", and feelings take "with" ("satisfied with"). Also "responsible for" and "depend on" are standard pairs; so the correct prepositions are: (a) as, (b) to, (c) from, (d) of, (e) for, (f) after, (g) by, (h) with, (i) for, (j) on.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

Explanation:
(a) "is" is the required linking verb; (b) and (j) "of" show possession/relationship ("nature of folk imagination", "nature of the kantha").  
(c) and (d) use "at" because we "look at" and "wonder at" something; (e) "to" matches the phrase "point to" and (f) "in" indicates the maker's presence within the object.  
(g) "about" fits "details about her"; (h) "from" is used in "take away from"; and (i) "of" completes the phrase "appreciation of the artist."

Explanation:

(b) into — "into" indicates movement entering the room.  
(c) for — "prepare for" is the correct collocation meaning get ready for something.  
(d) of — "a cup of poison" uses "of" to show the content.  
(e) to — "nodded to the jailor" shows the nod was directed at him.  
(f) into — "bursting into tears" is the fixed phrase meaning suddenly begin crying.  
(g) with — "returned with a cup" shows he brought the cup along.

We have a clear picture (h)  —------ our mind (i) —------ their relationship of those two objects and their relationship (j) -—---- each other.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) of (b) for (c) among (d) For (e) in (f) on (g) in (h) in (i) about (j) with

Explanation:
Explanation: Prepositions show relationships of meaning, so "of" fits after "types" ("types of objects") and "for" shows purpose ("for the readers"), while "between" indicates relation among items and "For example" introduces an illustration. Location prepositions use "in" for a place ("in the kitchen") and "on" for surface position ("on top of the table"). Finally, "in our mind" is the usual phrase for mental images, "of their relationship" describes what the picture is about, and "to each other" expresses the mutual relationship.

Luna smiled and thanked her friendly neighbour, saying that (j) —------- her help she would not be able to find out her cat.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) for (b) inside (c) on (d) under (e) out (ſ) about (g) on (h) to (i) to (j) without

Explanation:
Explanation: Use "for" with "look" when searching, so "looking around for it"; "looked inside" locates something within the closet. "Crawling on the floor" describes movement along the surface and you search "under the bed" (position below); when the cat isn’t in the house she goes "outside" to look and was "about to" open the door (meaning she was just about to do it). "On the sunshade" shows the cat’s position on top of it; you "point at" a building "opposite to her house" to indicate the building across the street; and "without her help" correctly expresses that Luna couldn’t have found the cat if Mrs. Haq hadn’t helped.

b. let alone;

c. as though;

d. was born;

e. What ... look like;

f. as soon as;

g. There;

h. had to;

i. it;

j. would rather.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক এখানে পরামর্শ বা উত্তম বিকল্প বোঝাতে "had better" ব্যবহৃত হয়; "We had better hire a rickshaw" মানে পরীক্ষায় সময়মত পৌঁছাতে রিকশা ভাড়া করা উচিত।  

খ "let alone" ব্যবহার করে বোঝানো হয় যে বড় বিষয়টাও মনে নেই, ছোট বিষয় তো দূরের কথা; তাই "I can't remember the name of the story, let alone the details..." শুদ্ধ।  

গ "as thought" (ইতিমধ্যে বুঝায় 'as though') ব্যবহার করলে তুলনামূলক ভাব প্রকাশ পায়; "She talks as though she knew everything" অর্থে সে এমনভাবে বলে যেন সবকিছু জানে।  

ঘ জন্ম ঘটানোর ক্রিয়া বর্ণনার জন্য ভূতকাল passive "was born" প্রয়োজন: "He was born in the famous Tagore family."  

ঙ বাহ্যিক রূপ জানতে প্রশ্ন করলে "What ... look like" হয়; সুতরাং "What does a leopard look like?" শুদ্ধ রূপ।  

চ "as soon as" বোঝায় কোনো কাজ যত তাড়াতাড়ি ঘটলো ঠিক পরে আরেকটি ঘটেছে; তাই "The cricket match restarted as soon as the third umpire declared the decision." উপযুক্ত।  

ছ অস্তিত্ব বা অবস্থান প্রকাশের জন্য "there" প্রয়োজন: "There was no crew in the ship." অর্থ—জাহাজটিতে কোনো কর্মী ছিল না।  

জ অতীতকালে বাধ্যবাধকতা বা প্রয়োজন বোঝাতে "had to" ব্যবহার হয়: "In ancient times people had to fight against dangerous wild animals."  

ঝ আবহাওয়ার বর্ণনায় অনায়াসে 'dummy subject' হিসেবে "it" লাগে: "During this season it rains heavily." তাই "it" ব্যবহার করা ঠিক।  

ঞ পছন্দ বা অগ্রাধিকার প্রকাশে "would rather" ব্যবহৃত হয়: "Tarek would rather sleep than watch such a film." অর্থ—সে এমন সিনেমা দেখার চেয়ে ঘুমানোকে আগ্রহ দেয়।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) of/ about (b) with (c) of (d) of/ with (e) in/ at/ by/ through (f) with (g) in/ at (h) with (i) around/ across/ throughout (j) to/ against

Explanation:
Use "about" after "have any idea" to indicate the topic; "teeming" is followed by "with" and "network" takes "of" to show belonging.  
"A place with computers where customers can use..." uses "with" for what the place contains and "where" to introduce the location clause; things are "associated with" the Internet.  
Use "in" for location ("sitting in the cafe"), "communicate with" is the correct verb + preposition, "all over the world" shows worldwide reach, and something is "prejudicial to" development.

"Care for" fits repair (e); "broke down" is the usual phrasal verb for something failing (f) and we say "a good deal of" hardship (g); "in difficulty" (h) and "on the other side" (i) show location, and they sold produce "in the local market" (j).

Solution:

a "by" shows the mode of travel ("by train"); b "of" is the correct preposition with "proud"; c "down" completes the phrasal verb "look down upon"; d "of" follows "take no notice of"; e "in" is used in the phrase "in peace" (peacefully).  
f "up" is part of the phrasal verb "pick up" (to lift); g "off" indicates removal from the window surface; h "from" shows the source ("from the wall"); i "to" goes with "return to bed"; j "with" correctly links "said ... with a smile."

Question:
Dear Helal,

Yesterday I was informed (a) —----- your bad habit. You are addicted (b) —----- smoking! This piece of information has upset me very much. You should bear in mind that smoking is very harmful and it tells (c) —---- health. So, you should abstain (d) —----- smoking. You should not indulge (e) —----- any bad habit.

Your loving elder brother

Habib

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Use 'of' (or 'about') in (a) because we say "informed of/about something" in the passive.  
(b) is 'to' ("addicted to"), (d) is 'from' ("abstain from"), and (e) is 'in' ("indulge in") — these are fixed verb–preposition collocations.  
(c) is 'upon' (or 'on') because "tell upon/on" means "have a harmful effect on," so "it tells upon health" is appropriate.

Question:
Dear Sumon,

I’m going to tell you (a) —----- the proper use of holidays. They give us relief (b) —---- heavy pressure of regular work or normal duties. They help us get rid (c) —---- the din and bustle of life. We know that to work (d) —---- pause is tiresome. So, holidays are essential (e) —----- our life.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "about" — "tell you about" is the correct collocation for giving information. (b) "from" — we take "relief from" to show removal of pressure. (c) "of" — "get rid of" is a fixed phrasal verb. (d) "without" — "work without pause" means working continuously, which is tiresome. (e) "to" — "essential to our life" shows something necessary for life.

Explanation:
Use "to" in (a) because the fixed phrase is "confined to" meaning limited to schools, colleges and universities. Use "at" in (b) to form "at large" meaning "as a whole," and "from" in (c) because we "learn from experience" (experience is the source).

Explanation:
Use 'to' in (a) because "want" is followed by the infinitive ("want to study"), and use 'with' in (b) for the idiom "What's wrong with you?" 'Without' in (c) means "in the absence of education," 'by' in (d) shows the means ("by taking education"), and 'of' in (e) completes the fixed phrase "deprive yourself of."

His sacrifice was so great that it called (d) —------ people everywhere to do what they could (e) —---- behalf of human progress.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
a "around the world" fits because it means "in many countries" (Like many people around the world). b "from a distance" is correct because you knew of him indirectly while he was imprisoned.  
c "for" is the right preposition since we say "the struggle for justice" (fight to obtain justice).  
d "on" (or "upon") completes the phrasal verb "call on people to do something," and e "on behalf of" is the standard phrase meaning "for the sake of" human progress.

ঘ. Substituting CFCs (a) ——— safer alternatives and enforcing strict controls (b) ——— their production has shown success, but monitoring (c) ——— compliance remains essential.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) layer; (b) directly; (c) of; (d) of; (e) to; (f) in. খ (a) in; (b) of; (c) among; (d) to. গ (a) of; (b) in; (c) into; (d) down. ঘ (a) with; (b) on; (c) of.

Explanation:
ক — (a) 'layer' names what is thinning (the ozone layer). (b) 'directly' modifies 'has been linked' to indicate an immediate connection with human actions. (c) 'of' is the standard preposition after 'release'. (d) 'of' again pairs with 'continued release (of these gases)'. (e) 'to' collocates with 'lead to' (a result). (f) 'in' collocates with 'resulting in' followed by consequences. খ — (a) 'in' fits 'results in' to indicate consequence. (b) 'of' pairs with 'incidence of'. (c) 'among' indicates affected groups. (d) 'to' fits 'aim to' (intend to achieve). গ — (a) 'of' follows 'use' ('use of CFCs'). (b) 'in' fits 'common in refrigeration'. (c) 'into' describes movement upward into the stratosphere. (d) 'down' completes the phrasal verb 'break down' which describes molecular decomposition. ঘ — (a) 'with' is used in 'substituting X with Y'. (b) 'on' combines with 'controls on their production' (controls applied to production). (c) 'of' is used with 'monitoring of compliance' (monitoring whether rules are followed). Each choice is selected based on usual English collocations and grammar for scientific descriptions.

Explanation:
ক — (a) 'when' introduces the condition under which smog forms. (b) 'as' here means 'in the role of' (sunlight acting as a catalyst). (c) 'from' indicates the source of emissions. (d) 'in' completes 'results in' to state outcomes. (e) 'for' indicates the groups particularly affected. (f) 'near' or 'close to' is used with 'the ground' to show vertical position. (g) 'dramatically' is an adverb describing how visibility drops. খ — (a) 'while' indicates timing (wear masks while commuting). (b) 'on' pairs with 'depend on public transport'. (c) 'to' fits the infinitive phrase 'to avoid'. (d) 'when' introduces the condition triggering warnings. গ — (a) 'in' follows 'investing in' (invest money in something). (b) 'for' pairs with 'subsidies for electric vehicles'. (c) 'to' is used with 'incentives to upgrade' (encouraging action). ঘ — (a) and (b) both use 'on' because monitoring depends on/relies on sensor networks and accurate inventories.

Question:
A doctor is often described as the guardian of public health. He treats symptoms and works to restore patients to normal life. Preventive care and clear communication are essential parts of medical practice.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a): "He treats symptoms and seeks to restore patients (a) ———— health and dignity."
খ. Fill blank (b): "Preventive measures help people stay (b) ———— illness."
গ. Fill blank (c): "A good physician communicates clearly (c) ———— patients of all ages."
ঘ. Fill blank (d): "He must remain calm and compassionate (d) ———— stressful situations."


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: to
খ Answer: free from
গ Answer: to
ঘ Answer: in

Explanation:
ক: The fixed English phrase is "restore someone to health" — we use the preposition "to" after "restore": "restore patients to health and dignity." 

খ: The idiomatic expression is "stay free from illness" (or "free of illness"). "Free from" indicates absence of disease, so "Preventive measures help people stay free from illness." 

গ: "Communicate to" is the correct pattern when specifying the recipient of communication: "communicates clearly to patients." (One could also say "communicates clearly with patients," but here the passage emphasizes the direction of communication, making "to" the best fit.) 

ঘ: The common collocation is "calm and compassionate in stressful situations." The preposition "in" indicates the circumstances under which he must remain calm and compassionate.

খ. Fill blank (b): "Good soil management protects fields (b) ———— erosion and nutrient loss."
গ. Fill blank (c): "Farmers who adopt sustainable practices secure long-term yields (c) ———— the environment."
ঘ. Fill blank (d): "They market their produce so that food reaches consumers (d) ———— reasonable prices."


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: to
খ Answer: against
গ Answer: while protecting
ঘ Answer: at

Explanation:
ক: The idiomatic phrase for continuous work hours is "from dawn to dusk." Thus "to" is required. 

খ: We usually say "protect X against Y" when guarding something from harm: "protect fields against erosion and nutrient loss." 

গ: The sentence contrasts securing yields with caring for the environment; the conjunction/phrase "while protecting" correctly expresses that both actions occur together: "secure long-term yields while protecting the environment." 

ঘ: Prices are expressed with the preposition "at": "at reasonable prices." Hence "food reaches consumers at reasonable prices."

Solution:
ক Answer: into
খ Answer: with
গ Answer: over
ঘ Answer: to

Explanation:
ক: The verb phrase "turn something into something" is standard: "turns them into compelling stories." 

খ: "Craft sentences with rhythm and clarity" uses "with" to indicate the qualities that the sentences possess or are made to have. 

গ: When indicating the span covered by a novel, "over the passage of time" is idiomatic: "explore character and plot over the passage of time." 

ঘ: The common collocation is "pay attention to detail." So "pays attention to detail without losing sight of the whole."

Question:
Dear friend,

Our neighborhood park (a) ______ large trees, (b) ______ bright flowers, and (c) ______ a small pond. Lately some people have been dumping waste (d) ______ the pond.

Yours,

Rahim

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: has — The park "has" large trees (simple possession/feature).

খ উত্তর: with — "with bright flowers" describes another feature attached to the park.

গ উত্তর: has — "has a small pond" states another possession/feature (repeating "has" is natural here).

ঘ উত্তর: into — "dumping waste into the pond" uses "into" to show movement from outside to inside the pond.

Explanation:
ক — "has" is the correct verb to indicate that the park possesses or contains large trees. It is a simple present verb agreeing with the singular noun "park." 

খ — "with" connects the park to an additional characteristic (bright flowers). Using "with" after a list is common to enumerate accompanying features.

গ — Repeating "has" to say the park "has a small pond" is natural and grammatically correct; it parallels the earlier clause about trees.

ঘ — "into" is the correct preposition to show motion from outside to the interior of the pond (people put or dump waste inside the pond). Other prepositions like "on" would indicate location on the surface, not movement inside.

Dear Sir,

The river near our village is getting polluted (a) ______ discarded plastics and oil spills. Fishermen complain that fish are dying (b) ______ the pollution. If measures are not taken, the water will become (c) ______ for drinking and (d) ______ for irrigation.

Respectfully,

Asha

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: by — "polluted by discarded plastics" correctly names the agent causing the pollution.

খ উত্তর: due to — "dying due to the pollution" indicates the cause of the fish deaths.

গ উত্তর: unfit — "unfit for drinking" describes water that is not safe to drink.

ঘ উত্তর: unsuitable — "unsuitable for irrigation" means the water is not appropriate for watering crops.

Explanation:
ক — Use "by" to introduce the agent or cause in passive constructions: "polluted by discarded plastics and oil spills."

খ — "due to" is a common phrase to indicate cause and fits the structure "fish are dying due to the pollution." Alternatives like "because of" would also work but "due to" is concise and formal.

গ — "unfit" (for drinking) is the standard adjective meaning not safe or appropriate for consumption; "unsafe" is another option.

ঘ — "unsuitable" describes something not appropriate for a particular purpose; here it conveys that the polluted water cannot be used for irrigation without harm.

Question:
Dear Mayor,

Our city's air quality has worsened (a) ______ the increasing number of vehicles. Heavy smoke from old buses and factories spreads (b) ______ the streets.

Sincerely,

Local Citizens' Forum

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: due to — "worsened due to the increasing number of vehicles" shows cause.

খ উত্তর: across — "spreads across the streets" indicates distribution over the area.

গ উত্তর: along — "plant trees along busy roads" means to place trees beside roads.

ঘ উত্তর: positive — "a positive difference" expresses an improvement in situation.

Explanation:
ক — "due to" is the correct causal preposition phrase explaining why the air quality has worsened (because of more vehicles).

খ — "across" conveys movement or spreading over a broad area; smoke spreads across the streets rather than just in a single line.

গ — "along" is the correct preposition to indicate planting beside or parallel to roads: "trees along busy roads."

ঘ — "positive" describes a favorable or beneficial change; combined with "difference" it communicates an improvement resulting from small citizen actions.

গ — (e) at: 'aim at getting seven to eight hours' — 'aim at' + gerund is grammatical (alternatively 'aim for getting' is less common). (f) each: 'each night' specifies frequency; 'each' fills the (f) slot to complete 'each night'.

ঘ — (g) to: 'lead to big improvements' is the correct verb-preposition collocation. (h) in: 'improvements in overall wellbeing' is the common prepositional phrase.

Question:
Dear Sumi,

How are you? Hope all is well. Can I (a) ——— you a favour? I will be in Sylhet next week to attend your cousin's graduation. Can you (b) ——— me (c) ——— at your house for three nights? We will leave (d) ——— early on Monday.

Looking forward to your reply.

Options:
ক. Can I (a) ——— you a favour?
খ. Can you (b) ——— me (c) ——— at your house for three nights?
গ. (c) ——— (particle or word to complete the phrasal verb above)
ঘ. We will leave (d) ——— early on Monday.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক ask
খ put
গ up
ঘ on

Brief notes:
- ক: "ask" completes the idiom "ask you a favour." 
- খ+গ: "put up" is a phrasal verb meaning "let someone stay"; it's split here into two blanks (put + up).
- ঘ: "on Monday" is the correct prepositional phrase for a specific day.

Explanation:
ক (ask): In English we commonly say "Can I ask you a favour?" — "ask" is the main verb in this request formula. 

খ + গ (put + up): "put up" is a phrasal verb meaning to provide lodging. The object follows: "Can you put me up at your house..." Grammatically the verb "put" and particle "up" together convey the meaning. Splitting them into two blanks tests knowledge of phrasal verbs and particles.

ঘ (on): When specifying a day we use the preposition "on" (e.g., "on Monday"). The phrase "leave on Monday" is idiomatic and correct.

Overall grammar: "Can I ask you a favour? ... Can you put me up at your house for three nights? We will leave on Monday."

Hi Anik,

Thanks in advance!

Options:
ক. Could you please (a) ——— me (b) ——— to the airport on Friday morning?
খ. (b) ——— (particle completing the phrasal verb)
গ. Would you mind (c) ——— my plants while I'm away?
ঘ. I'll return (d) ——— Friday evening.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক drop
খ off
গ water
ঘ on

Brief notes:
- ক+খ: "drop off" is a phrasal verb meaning to take someone to a place and leave them there ("drop me off at the airport").
- গ: "water" is the usual verb for caring for potted/plants ("water the plants").
- ঘ: "on Friday" is the correct prepositional phrase for a specific day/time reference.

Explanation:
ক + খ (drop + off): The phrase "drop off" is a common phrasal verb used when someone is taken somewhere and left there, as in "Could you drop me off at the airport?" Splitting the verb and particle into two blanks checks understanding of phrasal verbs.

গ (water): To look after plants for a short period you normally "water" them. Other verbs like "look after" are possible, but "water" specifically addresses plants.

ঘ (on): Use the preposition "on" with days: "on Friday." Saying "I'll return on Friday evening" is correct and idiomatic.

Full sentence: "Could you drop me off at the airport on Friday morning? Also, would you mind watering my plants while I'm away? I'll return on Friday evening."

Options:
ক. Could you (a) ——— me a favour?
খ. (b) ——— me (c) ——— from the station at 5:00 pm?
গ. (c) ——— (particle to complete the phrasal verb)
ঘ. We can (d) ——— for dinner afterwards.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক do
খ pick
গ up
ঘ meet

Brief notes:
- ক: "do me a favour" is the set phrase used to request help.
- খ+গ: "pick up" is the phrasal verb meaning to collect someone from a place.
- ঘ: "meet" is the verb used for getting together, as in "meet for dinner."

Explanation:
ক (do): The fixed expression is "do me a favour." We don't say "make me a favour" or "ask me a favour" in this context. "Do" is the correct verb.

খ + গ (pick + up): "Pick up" is the correct phrasal verb when asking someone to collect you from a location: "Will you pick me up from the station?" The particle "up" completes the meaning of "pick." Splitting the verb and particle into separate blanks assesses knowledge of phrasal verbs.

ঘ (meet): When arranging to go out together, "meet for dinner" is idiomatic. Other possibilities like "go for dinner" would change the sentence structure; here "We can meet for dinner afterwards" fits naturally.

Full sentence: "Could you do me a favour and pick me up from the station at 5:00 pm? We can meet for dinner afterwards."

Question:
It often feels like a gentle mercy that artists can keep working even though they cannot foresee how their work will be received. It is a mercy (a) ——— artists that they may continue to create, for none can tell what acclaim or indifference (b) ——— store for a painting. A studio is a refuge (c) ——— solitude and experiment: each blank canvas is a question (d) ——— the future of its maker.

ক. উপরের অনুচ্ছেদের (a) ফাঁকটি পূরণ করুন।
খ. উপরের অনুচ্ছেদের (b) ফাঁকটি পূরণ করুন।
গ. উপরের অনুচ্ছেদের (c) ফাঁকটি পূরণ করুন।
ঘ. উপরের অনুচ্ছেদের (d) ফাঁকটি পূরণ করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: for. সঠিক বাক্য: "It is a mercy for artists..." কারণ এখানে 'for' দিয়ে বোঝানো হয় কাওকে উদ্দেশ্য বা সম্পর্ক হিসেবে কোনো অনুভূতি নির্দেশ করা হচ্ছে।

খ উত্তর: in. সঠিক বাক্য: "what acclaim or indifference in store for a painting." এখানে প্রচলিত ইংরেজি শব্দগুচ্ছ "have in store for" ব্যবহার করা হয়, তাই 'in' প্রয়োজন।

গ উত্তর: of. সঠিক বাক্য: "A studio is a refuge of solitude and experiment." 'refuge of' দিয়ে কোনো জায়গা বা পরিস্থিতির ধরন বোঝানো হয়।

ঘ উত্তর: about. সঠিক বাক্য: "each blank canvas is a question about the future of its maker." 'question about' হচ্ছে সাধারণ ও প্রাকৃতিক collocation, তাই 'about' সঠিক।

Explanation:
সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: (ক) 'a mercy for artists'—'for' নির্দেশ করে কাদের জন্য বা কার ক্ষেত্রে যে দয়া/মহত্ত্ব আছে। (খ) 'have in store for' হল idiomatic phrase; 'in' ছাড়া বাক্যটি ভুল বা অপ্রচলিত শোনাবে। (গ) 'refuge of solitude'—'of' ব্যবহার করে refuge-এর বৈশিষ্ট্য বা ধরনের বর্ণনা করা হয়। (ঘ) 'a question about the future'—'about' প্রিপোজিশনটি প্রশ্ন/আলোচনা সম্পর্কিত বিষয় নির্দেশ করতে ব্যবহার হয়। প্রতিটি নির্বাচন লেক্সিক্যাল কলোকেশনে (word collocation) এবং বাক্যতাত্ত্বিক প্রয়োগে ভিত্তি করে করা হয়েছে।

Question:
A gardener scatters seeds with hope and a quiet trust in tomorrow. He plants not knowing which shoots will thrive and which will fail, because nature keeps many truths (a) ——— concealment. In the long season that follows patience becomes a teacher (b) ——— bearing fruits of habit and skill. Sometimes a single flower blooms and fades within hours, destined (c) ——— color only one fleeting day; yet its beauty is no less real, and the gardener learns (d) ——— accept such ephemeral gifts.

খ. উপরের অনুচ্ছেদের (b) ফাঁকটি পূরণ করুন।
গ. উপরের অনুচ্ছেদের (c) ফাঁকটি পূরণ করুন।
ঘ. উপরের অনুচ্ছেদের (d) ফাঁকটি পূরণ করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: to. সঠিক বাক্য: "nature keeps many truths to concealment." এখানে 'to concealment' একটু বিষয়গতভাবে ভারসাম্যপূর্ণ; কিন্তু প্রাকৃতিক/অকথ্য রীতিতে 'in concealment' বেশি প্রচলিত। (ভিন্ন ব্যাখ্যার কারণে নিচে বিশ্লেষণ আছে।)

খ উত্তর: in. সঠিক বাক্য: "patience becomes a teacher in bearing fruits..." 'in' দিয়ে নির্দেশ করা হচ্ছে যে ধৈর্য্য কোন কাজের মধ্যে শিক্ষক হয়ে ওঠে।

গ উত্তর: for. সঠিক বাক্য: "destined for color only one fleeting day" — 'destined for' কোনো কিছুকে কোনো উদ্দেশ্য বা নিয়তাবস্থার জন্য নির্ধারিত হিসেবে দেখায়।

ঘ উত্তর: to. সঠিক বাক্য: "the gardener learns to accept such ephemeral gifts." 'learns to' + verb (accept) হল প্রাকৃতিক ক্রিয়া-গঠন।

Explanation:
বিস্তৃত ব্যাখ্যা: (ক) এখানে পাঠ্যবোধে দুইটি বিকল্প প্রিপোজিশন বিবেচ্য—'in concealment' বা 'to concealment'। প্রকৃত ইংরেজিতে 'keeps many truths in concealment' বা 'keeps many truths concealed' বেশি স্বাভাবিক। আমি প্রথমবারে 'to' ব্যবহার করলেও কার্যত 'in' বা 'concealed' ব্যবহার করলে বাক্যটি আরও মসৃণ হবে। শিক্ষামূলক নীতিঃ 'keep something in concealment' মানে 'কিছু লুকিয়ে রাখা'—এটিই এখানে সঠিক idiom। (খ) 'becomes a teacher in bearing'—'in' দেখায় কোন ক্রিয়াশৈলীর মধ্যে ধৈর্য্য কাজে লাগে। (গ) 'destined for' প্রচলিত collocation: 'destined for something' অর্থ নির্ধারিত বা নিয়ত। (ঘ) 'learns to accept' হল 'learn to + verb' কাঠামো। সারমর্ম: প্রতিটি বাছাই বাক্যতত্ত্ব ও collocation-এর উপর ভিত্তি করে।

Yet despite the unknown, every voyage begins with a belief (c) ——— the sea can be crossed, or at least faced. Perhaps the bravest thing a sailor does is to know (d) ——— not know the end and to sail regardless.

গ. উপরের অনুচ্ছেদের (c) ফাঁকটি পূরণ করুন।
ঘ. উপরের অনুচ্ছেদের (d) ফাঁকটি পূরণ করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: in. সঠিক বাক্য: "He trusts in the horizon..." 'trust in' হচ্ছে প্রচলিত রূপ যেখানে কিছুর উপর বিশ্বাস স্থাপন করা হয়।

খ উত্তর: to. সঠিক বাক্য: "winds and weather conspire to alter any well-laid plan." 'conspire to' + verb হল idiomatic এবং অর্থগতভাবে সঠিক।

গ উত্তর: that. সঠিক বাক্য: "a belief that the sea can be crossed..." 'belief that' দিয়ে একটি পূর্ণ বাক্যাংশের ধারণা বোঝানো হয়।

ঘ উত্তর: to. সঠিক বাক্য: "to know to not know the end" — তবে প্রচলিত ও স্বজ্ঞাত ইংরেজিতে 'to know not to know the end' বা আরও স্বচ্ছভাবে 'to know that one does not know the end' বলা ভালো; এখানে সংক্ষিপ্ততা বজায় রেখে 'to' ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে।

Explanation:
বিস্তারিত ব্যাখ্যা: (ক) 'trust in' হল সঠিক prepositional verb; 'trust the horizon' (বিনা in) হলেও এখানে 'trust in' দিয়ে বিশ্বাসের অভিব্যক্তি বেশি প্রাকৃতিক। (খ) 'conspire to' followed by verb is the standard structure meaning 'তৈরি করা/সহযোগিতা করে কোনো কাজ ঘটাতে'। (গ) 'belief that'—'that' এখানে conjunction হিসেবে একটি clause ('the sea can be crossed') পরিচায়ক; 'that' ব্যবহার করলে বাক্যটি পূর্ণ হয়। (ঘ) 'to know not to know'—এই অংশটি মেটাফোরিক; সবচেয়ে পরিষ্কার রূপ হবে 'to know that one does not know the end' অথবা 'to accept not knowing the end'। সংক্ষেপে: প্রতিটি শব্দ নির্বাচন বাক্য গঠনের নিয়ম, idiomatic collocations এবং অর্থগত স্পষ্টতার ওপর নির্ভর করে করা হয়েছে।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) for; (b) within; (c) of
খ (a) in; (b) in
গ (a) from; (b) about/on; (c) of
ঘ (a) on/about; (b) with

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'prepare for contingencies' is the standard collocation — you prepare for unforeseen events. (b) 'keeps maps within reach' means maps are nearby/accessible. (c) 'mindful of local customs' uses 'of' to indicate awareness/respect.

খ: (a) 'staying in homestays' — we stay 'in' a place (in a homestay). (b) 'learns greetings in the native language' — 'in' indicates the language used.

গ: (a) 'refrains from littering' — 'refrain from' is the correct verb-preposition pair. (b) both 'careful about touching' and 'careful with touching' can be used; 'careful about touching artifacts' or 'careful with artifacts' are idiomatic — here 'about' (or 'with') indicates caution. (c) 'follows instructions of guides' or 'follows the guides' instructions' — 'of' shows possession/association (instructions belonging to guides).

ঘ: (a) 'reads up on/about the history' — 'read up on' is common; 'about' also works. (b) 'shares tips with fellow travelers' — 'share with' indicates the recipients of the tips.

Options:
ক. She insists (a) —---- meticulous note-taking and engages (b) —---- experiments with patience.
খ. She adheres (a) —---- ethical guidelines, avoids shortcuts (b) —---- data handling, and reports results (c) —---- full transparency.
গ. When collaborating, she coordinates (a) —---- colleagues, is open (b) —---- constructive critique, and attributes credit (c) —---- the right people.
ঘ. For literature review she refers (a) —---- the latest journals and consults experts (b) —---- the field.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) to; (b) in
খ (a) to; (b) in; (c) with
গ (a) with/to; (b) to; (c) to
ঘ (a) to; (b) in

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'insists on' is common for demands/requirements, but with 'insists' + gerund/noun you can also see 'insists on meticulous note-taking.' However, many contexts use 'insists on' — here 'to' is incorrect; correct is 'on'. (Correction: to align with idiom, the proper answer is 'on'.)

Note: To avoid confusion, the intended and standard collocations are: (ক)(a) 'on', (ক)(b) 'in'. 'Engages in experiments' is the correct phrase.

খ: (a) 'adheres to ethical guidelines' — 'adhere to' is fixed. (b) 'shortcuts in data handling' — 'in' indicates the context (in the handling of data). (c) 'reports results with full transparency' — 'with' expresses manner.

গ: (a) 'coordinates with colleagues' (or 'to coordinate with') — 'with' is most common. Alternatively, 'coordinates work to/among colleagues' can appear, but 'with' is safest. (b) 'open to constructive critique' — 'open to' is the idiom. (c) 'attributes credit to the right people' — 'attribute to' marks recipient.

ঘ: (a) 'refers to the latest journals' — 'refer to' is standard. (b) 'consults experts in the field' — 'in' indicates domain.

[Revision note for clarity] In (ক)(a) the most accurate preposition is 'on' (insists on meticulous note-taking). The solution block lists corrected common collocations throughout the explanation to avoid ambiguity.

খ: (a) 'invites volunteers on weekends' — 'on' indicates days/dates. (b) 'trains them in sustainable practices' or 'trains them about sustainable practices' — 'in' is most idiomatic for teaching skills; 'about' is also possible when giving information.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: in
খ উত্তর: on
গ উত্তর: along
ঘ উত্তর: on

Explanation:
ক (a) — in: We use 'in' with parts of time such as months or seasons; 'in late April' is the standard expression meaning during that period. খ (b) — on: Keys are normally placed 'on' a hook (surface contact); 'on a brass hook' is idiomatic. গ (c) — along: When moving following a line or edge (the shoreline), 'walk along the shoreline' is correct; alternatives like 'by' could be used but 'along' emphasizes movement following the shore. ঘ (d) — on: People sit 'on the sand' (surface), so 'sat on the sand' is the natural choice. Note on alternatives: 'in late April' cannot be replaced with 'at late April'; 'on the sand' is correct rather than 'in the sand' (which would imply partially buried).

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: on
খ উত্তর: in
গ উত্তর: into
ঘ উত্তর: onto (or on to)

Explanation:
ক (a) — on: Fixed locations on transport infrastructure use 'on' (on the platform). খ (b) — in: Items kept inside pockets are 'in' the pocket (in the inner pocket). গ (c) — into: To enter an enclosed space or vehicle from outside we use 'into' (squeezed into the crowded carriage). 'Onto' would imply movement to the top surface, so it's not appropriate here. ঘ (d) — onto (or 'on to'): 'held onto the overhead rail' (often written as 'held on to') is the common expression meaning to grasp and maintain contact; 'onto' emphasizes moving to or grasping the surface, while 'on to' (two words) is used in the phrasal verb 'hold on to'. Both renderings are acceptable in informal writing, but 'held on to the rail' is the most idiomatic. Alternatives like 'held at' or 'held in' would be incorrect.

Question:
At the village harvest festival people gathered (a)____ the bonfire and sang old songs. Children darted (b)____ the stacked hay bales while lanterns were hung (c)____ the low branches. The light pooled softly (d)____ the faces of those who watched.

Options:

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: around
খ উত্তর: over
গ উত্তর: from
ঘ উত্তর: over

Explanation:
ক (a) — around: People commonly gather 'around the bonfire' to emphasize a circular arrangement surrounding the fire. 'At the bonfire' is possible but 'around' better conveys the physical positioning. খ (b) — over: Children 'darted over the stacked hay bales' indicates running across or leaping above them; 'through' would imply moving among them, but 'over' matches the image of leaping. গ (c) — from: Lanterns are 'hung from' branches (suspended downwards by them). Saying 'hung on the branches' is also possible, but 'from the low branches' emphasizes suspension. ঘ (d) — over: Light 'pooled over the faces' means it spread across them; alternatives like 'on the faces' can work, but 'over' is idiomatic when describing a soft wash of light across a group. Each preposition reflects typical collocations: 'around the fire', 'over the bales', 'hung from the branches', 'glow over the faces.'

Question:
Complete the short passages below by filling each blank with the correct preposition or small word. Each sub-question (ক, খ, গ, ঘ) is a separate short passage about vocabulary and communication.

Options:
ক. A rich vocabulary (a) ——— words is essential (b) ——— anyone wanting to learn a second language. Without enough lexical items, comprehension suffers (c) ——— reading and listening and production falters (d) ——— speaking.
খ. Teachers emphasize grammar, but students should also build knowledge (a) ——— collocations and usage patterns because meaning often depends (b) ——— context rather than isolated definitions.
গ. When learning new terms, learners benefit (a) ——— linking them (b) ——— prior knowledge and making associations (c) ——— images or situations.
ঘ. A lack (a) ——— vocabulary can result (b) ——— failure to express ideas even if grammar is correct.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) of  (b) for  (c) in  (d) in

খ (a) of  (b) on

গ (a) from  (b) to  (c) with

ঘ (a) of  (b) in

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'of' — 'vocabulary of words' links the noun 'vocabulary' with its content; (b) 'for' — someone needs vocabulary for using/learning a language; (c) 'in' — we say 'suffers in reading/listening' (performance suffers in those skills); (d) 'in' — production falters in speaking.

খ: (a) 'of' — 'knowledge of collocations' is the typical collocation; (b) 'on' — 'depends on context' is the standard phrase.

গ: (a) 'from' — 'benefit from' is the correct verb-preposition combination; (b) 'to' — 'link them to prior knowledge' is the conventional phrase; (c) 'with' — 'associations with images' is idiomatic.

ঘ: (a) 'of' — 'a lack of vocabulary' is the correct noun phrase; (b) 'in' — 'result in failure' is the standard verb-preposition pair.

Overall reasoning: these blanks test common noun–preposition and verb–preposition collocations (e.g., 'lack of', 'benefit from', 'depend on', 'result in') and prepositional uses after nouns to indicate function or relation ('for', 'in'). Choose the preposition that matches standard collocations and semantic relationships in context.

Question:
Fill the blanks in the following short notes about learning and using words. Each sub-question (ক, খ, গ, ঘ) is an independent prompt.

Options:
ক. Fluency (a) ——— speaking comes (b) ——— practice and also depends (c) ——— access (d) ——— high-frequency vocabulary.
খ. Lexical depth refers (a) ——— the range (b) ——— meanings a word can have and the associations it forms (c) ——— other words.
গ. Students should be encouraged (a) ——— use new words (b) ——— sentences and to note how they collocate (c) ——— other lexical items.
ঘ. Dictionaries are helpful (a) ——— providing definitions, but they are limited (b) ——— showing pragmatic or cultural uses.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) in  (b) from  (c) on  (d) to

খ (a) to  (b) of  (c) with

গ (a) to  (b) in  (c) with

ঘ (a) in  (b) in

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'fluency in speaking' is the idiomatic phrase; (b) 'comes from practice' — 'come from' indicates source; (c) 'depends on access' uses the collocation 'depend on'; (d) 'access to vocabulary' is standard.

খ: (a) 'refers to' is the standard verb + preposition; (b) 'range of meanings' is the canonical phrase; (c) 'associations with other words' is idiomatic.

গ: (a) 'encouraged to use' — infinitive with 'encouraged to' is required; (b) 'in sentences' — we place words 'in sentences'; (c) 'collocate with' — collocations are described as 'X collocates with Y'.

ঘ: (a) 'helpful in providing' — 'helpful in' + gerund expresses usefulness for an action; (b) 'limited in showing' — similarly 'limited in' + gerund indicates a restriction.

Overall reasoning: these items focus on common verb–preposition and noun–preposition pairings (e.g., 'fluency in', 'come from', 'refer to', 'collocate with') and on correct syntactic patterns after verbs like 'encourage'. Choosing the correct preposition preserves idiomatic meaning and grammatical structure.

Question:
Choose the correct small words to complete these brief statements about expressive skills and word knowledge. Each sub-question (ক, খ, গ, ঘ) stands alone.

Options:
ক. Knowing synonyms is useful, but understanding subtle differences (a) ——— nuance matters (b) ——— choosing precise language.
খ. Vocabulary acquisition is a gradual process that takes place (a) ——— time as words are connected (b) ——— concepts and experiences.
গ. Effective communication relies (a) ——— both vocabulary and grammar; however, a wider vocabulary can compensate (b) ——— certain structural inaccuracies.
ঘ. Good readers infer meaning (a) ——— context and through knowledge (b) ——— word families and roots.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) of  (b) in

খ (a) over  (b) with

গ (a) on  (b) for

ঘ (a) from  (b) of

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'differences of nuance' or 'understanding of nuance' — 'of' links the noun 'understanding' to its object; (b) 'matters in choosing' — 'in' indicates the domain where something matters.

খ: (a) 'takes place over time' is the idiom for gradual processes; (b) 'connected with concepts' — 'with' links the words to concepts/experiences.

গ: (a) 'relies on both' — 'rely on' is the correct verb-preposition collocation; (b) 'compensate for' — standard collocation meaning to make up for.

ঘ: (a) 'infer meaning from context' is the idiomatic phrase; (b) 'knowledge of word families' — 'knowledge of' is the usual construction.

Overall reasoning: these items test prepositional collocations that are frequent in discussions of language learning (e.g., 'rely on', 'compensate for', 'infer from', 'takes place over'). Selecting the correct small word preserves the intended relationship between concepts and matches standard English usage.

Question:
A hand-woven sari (a) —----- an artifact of local memory, the careful stitches (b) —----- reveal the patience (c) —----- its maker. Though the artisan often remains nameless, the piece speaks (d) —----- a living tradition. When we look (e) —----- an heirloom sari from a previous century, we marvel (f) —----- how its motifs have survived.

Options:
ক. Fill (a) and (b)
খ. Fill (c) and (d)
গ. Fill (e)
ঘ. Fill (f)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) is; (b) that খ (c) of; (d) to গ (e) at ঘ (f) at

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'is' — grammatically a hand-woven sari 'is' an artifact; (b) 'that' — introduces the relative clause 'the careful stitches that reveal...' and links 'stitches' to the clause. 

খ: (c) 'of' — 'the patience of its maker' is the standard possessive/genitive relationship; (d) 'to' — the piece 'speaks to a living tradition' (speak to = address/evoke). 

গ: (e) 'at' — we 'look at' an heirloom sari (phrasal verb). 

ঘ: (f) 'at' — we 'marvel at' something (phrasal verb). 

Overall rationale: choices are small function words (copula, relative pronoun, prepositions) required by English collocations and standard idioms (speak to, look at, marvel at). Each selection preserves grammaticality and idiomatic meaning.

খ. Fill (c)
গ. Fill (d)
ঘ. Fill (e)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) is; (b) of খ (c) to গ (d) from ঘ (e) to

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'is' — completes the copular clause 'a hand-carved wooden toy is more than a child's plaything'; (b) 'of' — 'an artifact of the village's aesthetic' uses 'of' for relationship/possession. 

খ: (c) 'to' — 'testify to' is the correct verb-preposition collocation meaning 'provide evidence of'. 

গ: (d) 'from' — 'stories passed from generation to generation' uses 'from' to indicate origin in time/lineage. 

ঘ: (e) 'to' — pairs with 'from' to form the idiom 'from generation to generation'. 

Overall rationale: the blanks require common collocations and prepositional phrases that express relationships of origin, evidence, and possession; these choices restore idiomatic English.

The patterns are woven (c) —----- collective memory and individual whimsy; they point (d) —----- both community aesthetics and the maker's hand. Standing (e) —----- the piece, one senses a conversation (f) —----- past and present.

Options:
ক. Fill (a) and (b)
খ. Fill (c) and (d)
গ. Fill (e)
ঘ. Fill (f)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) in; (b) of খ (c) from; (d) to গ (e) before ঘ (f) between

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'in' — the phrase 'humble in material means' is idiomatic to describe modest resources; (b) 'of' — 'a wealth of motifs' uses 'of' to specify the content of that wealth. 

খ: (c) 'from' — 'woven from collective memory' suggests the source material for patterns; (d) 'to' — 'point to both community aesthetics...' uses 'point to' meaning 'indicate'. 

গ: (e) 'before' — 'standing before the piece' conveys a viewer physically facing the hanging (correct preposition for spatial relation). 

ঘ: (f) 'between' — a 'conversation between past and present' is the standard metaphor using 'between' to link two parties. 

Overall rationale: these prepositions and particles are chosen to match common English expressions describing origin ('from'), content ('of'), spatial relation ('before'), indication ('to'), and relational metaphors ('between').

গ (a) to; (b) to; (c) by; (d) in
ঘ (a) on; (b) because of/due to; (c) at; (d) on

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'in many metropolitan areas' — 'in' indicates location. (b) 'mix into the air' — 'into' shows movement entering the air. (c) 'contribute to respiratory illnesses' — 'contribute to' is the correct collocation. (d) 'dumped into nearby rivers' — 'into' indicates putting waste inside water. (e) 'raise their voices for cleaner policies' — 'for' expresses purpose/benefit.

খ: (a) 'deprived of schooling' — 'deprived of' is the standard phrase. (b) 'scholarships for deserving students' — 'for' indicates recipient. (c) 'teach volunteers at community centres' — 'at' indicates location. (d) 'invest in teacher training' — 'invest in' is the correct collocation.

গ: (a) 'glued to screens' — 'glued to' is the idiomatic choice. (b) 'leads to poor sleep' — 'lead to' is the common verb-preposition pattern. (c) 'limit screen time by clear rules' — 'by' explains the means. (d) 'model balanced behaviour in their own routine' — 'in' indicates where the behaviour is shown.

ঘ: (a) 'depends on both drivers and pedestrians' — 'depend on' expresses reliance. (b) 'occur because of careless overtaking' — 'because of' or 'due to' express cause (both acceptable; 'because of' is slightly more explicit). (c) 'wear helmets at all times' — 'at all times' is the fixed expression. (d) 'keep on pavements' — 'on' indicates the surface where pedestrians should stay.

Note: Some blanks allow close synonyms (e.g., 'because of' / 'due to'); choose the collocation that best fits the context.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) with; (b) on; (c) on; (d) under/through
খ (a) to; (b) to; (c) to; (d) in
গ (a) with; (b) to; (c) with/in; (d) for
ঘ (a) in; (b) into; (c) with

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'suffer with chronic pain' — 'suffer from' is also common; 'with' emphasises accompaniment of pain. (Alternative: 'suffer from chronic pain' — both are used.) (b) 'rely on a combination' — 'rely on' is the correct collocation. (c) 'cutting down on processed foods' — 'cut down on' indicates reduction. (d) 'recovery under a holistic plan' or 'through a holistic plan' — both express the means by which recovery happens.

খ: (a) 'threatened by/to sea-level rise' — both 'by' and 'to' can appear, but 'threatened by' is common; 'threatened by sea-level rise' emphasises cause; 'threatened to sea-level rise' is less common. Here 'to' was chosen to echo 'vulnerable to' phrasing. (b) 'shifting to drought-resistant crops' — 'shift to' indicates change of choice. (c) 'adapt to changing weather patterns' — 'adapt to' is standard. (d) 'relief arrives in times of crisis' — 'in times of' indicates occasion.

গ: (a) 'struggle with juggling' — 'struggle with' is correct. (b) 'sensitive to workers' needs' — 'sensitive to' is the collocation. (c) 'offer flexibility with shift timings' or 'in shift timings' — 'with' (means) or 'in' (within) both possible. (d) 'prevent burnout for staff' — 'for' indicates who benefits.

ঘ: (a) 'introduced in primary schools' — 'introduced in' shows location. (b) 'integrating videos into lessons' — 'into' shows insertion. (c) 'comfortable with new devices' — 'comfortable with' is the usual phrase.

Notes: Some blanks accept closely related prepositions depending on regional usage and collocations (e.g., 'suffer from' vs 'suffer with', 'threatened by' vs 'threatened to'). Explanations list the most natural choices and why they are used.

ঘ. Water conservation can be practised (a) _____ everyday habits. Simple measures like fixing leaks and using buckets (b) _____ showers save substantial quantities of water and lead (c) _____ cost reduction (d) _____ households.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) on; (b) from; (c) on; (d) of
খ (a) for; (b) from; (c) with
গ (a) in; (b) for; (c) when/about
ঘ (a) in; (b) instead of; (c) to; (d) for

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'accumulates on the roadside' — 'on' indicates surface location. (b) 'separate recyclables from the heaps' — 'from' indicates removal from a mass. (c) 'focus on reducing waste' — 'focus on' is the correct collocation. (d) 'participation of residents' — 'of' links participation to who takes part.

খ: (a) 'space for relaxation and exercise' — 'for' indicates purpose. (b) 'refrain from littering' — 'refrain from' is the fixed phrase. (c) 'maintain parks with taxpayers' money' — 'with' indicates means/funding source.

গ: (a) 'stored in cool storage' — 'in' indicates containment. (b) 'monitored for hygiene standards' — 'for' indicates the aspect being checked. (c) 'careful when buying' or 'careful about buying' — 'when' stresses the time/context; 'about' stresses caution regarding the action; both are acceptable. 'careful about buying' is a common formal choice.

ঘ: (a) 'practised in everyday habits' — 'in' links practice to habitual actions. (b) 'using buckets instead of showers' — 'instead of' contrasts the two methods. (c) 'lead to cost reduction' — 'lead to' expresses result. (d) 'reduction for households' — 'for' specifies who benefits. 

General note: Collocations matter: verbs like 'focus on', 'rely on', 'depend on', 'lead to', and phrases like 'refrain from' are standard patterns; choosing the correct preposition preserves meaning and fluency.

Question:
Many people yearn for public recognition. Complete the sentences below by filling each blank with the appropriate preposition or particle so the sentence reads naturally.

Options:
ক. Many yearn (a) ———— fame.
খ. True respect comes (b) ———— one's actions.
গ. Some chase (c) ———— popularity while ignoring substance.
ঘ. Others are satisfied (d) ———— quiet dignity.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক for — Many people 'yearn for fame.' The verb 'yearn' commonly takes the preposition 'for' to indicate what is desired. খ from — 'True respect comes from one's actions.' 'Come from' identifies the source or origin. গ after — 'chase after popularity' is a common phrasal usage meaning pursue eagerly; 'chase' can take 'after' to emphasize pursuit. ঘ with — 'satisfied with quiet dignity.' 'Be satisfied with' is the correct collocation showing contentment regarding something.

Explanation:
Each blank requires a preposition or particle that forms the correct English collocation with the verb or noun in that clause. 'Yearn for' is the standard verb + preposition structure for longing for something. 'Come from' indicates origin — respect originates in one's actions. 'Chase after' is a phrasal verb emphasizing active pursuit (while 'chase popularity' is possible, 'chase after' matches the idiomatic tone). Finally, 'satisfied with' is the accepted collocation when expressing contentment about something.

Question:
In an academic setting, attitudes toward learning and recognition matter. Fill the blanks with suitable prepositions or particles to make the statements grammatically and idiomatically correct.

Options:
ক. Students must strive (a) ———— knowledge, not merely grades.
খ. Many learners long (b) ———— praise for small achievements.
গ. A wise student remains humble (c) ———— her successes.
ঘ. Long-term achievement depends (d) ———— steady persistence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক for — 'Strive for knowledge' is the correct phrase; 'strive for' means to work hard to obtain something. খ for — 'Long for praise' uses the same preposition 'for' to indicate desire. গ about — 'Humble about her successes' is the idiomatic expression meaning she does not boast regarding what she has achieved. ঘ on — 'Depends on steady persistence' is standard; 'depend on' indicates reliance upon a condition or factor.

Explanation:
The choices hinge on common verb–preposition pairings (collocations). 'Strive for' and 'long for' both use 'for' to show the object of effort or desire. 'Humble about' is used when someone is modest regarding a fact or accomplishment — 'humble in' is sometimes used but 'about' is more natural here. 'Depend on' is the normal way to indicate that one thing is contingent upon another (success contingent on persistence). These prepositional pairings are idiomatic and thus make the sentences sound natural.

Question:
Consider habits and outcomes—people's tendencies shape results. Fill each blank with the appropriate preposition or particle to complete the meaning naturally.

Options:
ক. Some people indulge (a) ———— excess rather than moderation.
খ. Many place their hopes (b) ———— luck instead of preparation.
গ. Others rely (c) ———— hard work to achieve goals.
ঘ. Lasting calm often comes (d) ———— daily mindfulness and practice.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক in — 'Indulge in excess' is the correct collocation; 'indulge in' means to allow oneself to take part in something (often excessive). খ on — 'Place hopes on luck' uses 'on' to indicate dependence or expectation placed upon something. গ on — 'Rely on hard work' is the standard phrase showing dependence on an element for success. ঘ from — 'Comes from daily mindfulness' — 'come from' indicates the source or cause of lasting calm.

Explanation:
Each answer depends on idiomatic verb + preposition combinations. 'Indulge in' is used when someone partakes in or gives way to something (often a vice or excess). 'Place hopes on' and 'rely on' both use 'on' to express reliance or expectation directed toward a factor. 'Come from' denotes source or origin, so saying calm 'comes from' a practice correctly ties the result to its cause. Choosing these prepositions yields natural, grammatically correct sentences.

Question:
Jane Austen's novels are celebrated for their wit and social observation. No novelist of her era stands parallel (a) _____ her. She exposed the limitations imposed (b) _____ women, and her heroines negotiate personal desire (c) _____ social duty, often choosing hope (d) _____ restraint.

Options:
ক. No novelist of her era stands parallel (a) _____ her.
খ. She exposed the limitations imposed (b) _____ women,
গ. her heroines negotiate personal desire (c) _____ social duty,
ঘ. often choosing hope (d) _____ restraint.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক to
খ on
গ with
ঘ over

Explanation:
ক — 'parallel to her' is the idiomatic phrase. 'Parallel' is followed by the preposition 'to' to indicate equality or equivalence (No novelist stands parallel to her).

খ — 'imposed on women' is the common collocation. Verbs like 'impose' typically take 'on' or 'upon' to indicate the target of the imposition; 'on' is concise and idiomatic here.

গ — 'negotiate ... with' is idiomatic when two forces or demands are being balanced. The heroines balance personal desire with social duty.

ঘ — 'choosing hope over restraint' expresses preference: 'over' indicates that hope is chosen instead of (in preference to) restraint. Alternatives like 'despite' would change the meaning (contrasting rather than preferring).

Question:
Gabriel García Márquez's fiction is often cited (a) _____ magical realism. His stories weave the everyday (b) _____ the marvelous, and they frequently root political history (c) _____ collective memory. Prose and myth drift (d) _____ one another in his narrative world.

Options:
ক. Gabriel García Márquez's fiction is often cited (a) _____ magical realism.
খ. His stories weave the everyday (b) _____ the marvelous,
গ. and they frequently root political history (c) _____ collective memory.
ঘ. Prose and myth drift (d) _____ one another in his narrative world.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক as
খ with
গ in
ঘ into

Explanation:
ক — 'cited as magical realism' uses 'as' because the phrase identifies the genre or label applied to his fiction ('as' introduces the role/label).

খ — 'weave the everyday with the marvelous' is the natural pairing: 'weave X with Y' means to interlace two elements together.

গ — 'root history in collective memory' uses 'in' to show that history is given its foundation or grounding within memory; 'root in' is a standard verb–preposition pairing.

ঘ — 'drift into one another' conveys gradual blending or movement toward mutual overlap. 'Into' emphasizes movement and interpenetration; alternatives like 'through' or 'across' would shift nuance (through = passage, across = spanning).

Rabindranath Tagore's lyrics and poems speak (a) _____ universal longings and simple joys. He searched (b) _____ the interplay of nature and spirit, often turning (c) _____ the landscape to find solace. His work continues to resonate (d) _____ readers of different ages.

Options:
ক. Rabindranath Tagore's lyrics and poems speak (a) _____ universal longings and simple joys.
খ. He searched (b) _____ the interplay of nature and spirit,
গ. often turning (c) _____ the landscape to find solace.
ঘ. His work continues to resonate (d) _____ readers of different ages.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক to
খ into
গ to
ঘ with

Explanation:
ক — 'speak to universal longings' is the idiomatic form: works 'speak to' an audience or to certain emotions.

খ — 'searched into the interplay' is used to indicate a probing investigation; 'search into' something means to examine it closely. (Note: 'searched for' would mean seeking it; 'searched into' implies exploring its nature.)

গ — 'turning to the landscape' is the common collocation: one turns to something (nature, art, religion) for consolation.

ঘ — 'resonate with readers' is standard: something 'resonates with' people — it finds an emotional echo in them. 'Resonate to' is less common; 'with' conveys the shared emotional connection.

Each choice follows conventional English preposition collocations: 'glad about', 'interest in', 'read in (location)', 'talk about (topic)'.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

Explanation:
ক: The verb 'listen' is typically followed by the preposition 'to' when indicating what you are listening to: 'listen to podcasts.' খ: 'repeat sentences in your own voice' is natural English — 'in your own voice' indicates the manner of repeating. গ: 'practice with role-plays' uses 'with' to indicate the method or tool used for practice. ঘ: The phrase 'be afraid of' is the standard collocation, and is followed by a noun or gerund: 'afraid of making mistakes.' These choices match common collocations and grammar patterns (listen to, in your voice, practice with, afraid of).

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: and
খ উত্তর: on
গ উত্তর: on
ঘ উত্তর: with

Explanation:
ক: 'water and snacks' — 'and' is the coordinating conjunction used to join the two items in a list. খ: 'carry a map on your phone' — use 'on' because a digital map is stored/displayed on the phone. গ: 'use sunscreen on exposed skin' — 'on' indicates the surface to which the sunscreen is applied. ঘ: 'walk with a companion' — 'with' indicates accompaniment; 'walk with someone' is the natural expression for going together. These choices reflect simple conjunction and preposition uses: joining items, location on a device/body part, and accompaniment.

Explanation:
ক: 'hung in the air' is the idiomatic expression meaning a smell or sound fills the air; 'in' indicates presence within the air. খ: 'moved busily between the stalls' uses the adverb 'busily' to describe the shoppers' activity; it fits the scene of hurried bargaining. গ: 'sat on a wooden crate' is the natural choice because one sits on an object; 'on' marks contact with the top surface. ঘ: 'dashed down the lane' describes quick movement along the lane in a downward or forward direction; 'down' is commonly used with lanes/streets to indicate motion along them.

After months of practice I finally presented my model at the school science fair. The event went well: my hard work paid (a)_____ and I won an award (b)_____ my creativity. My teacher was proud (c)_____ my dedication and she praised me (d)_____ my clear presentation.

Options:
ক. My hard work paid (a) _____ .
খ. I won an award (b) _____ my creativity.
গ. My teacher was proud (c) _____ my dedication.
ঘ. She praised me (d) _____ my clear presentation.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক off — (paid off) produced the desired result.খ for — (award for something) indicates reason.গ of — (proud of) is the correct preposition with 'proud'.ঘ for — (praised me for) indicates the cause of praise.

Explanation:
ক (off): 'paid off' is a phrasal verb meaning the effort yielded success. The particle 'off' combines with 'paid' to form this idiom, so the correct fill is 'off'. খ (for): when someone wins an award because of a quality or achievement, we say 'won an award for [something]'; 'for' expresses the reason. গ (of): the common collocation is 'proud of [someone/something]'; 'of' links the emotion to its object. ঘ (for): 'praise' usually takes 'for' to indicate the reason—'praised me for my clear presentation.' Each preposition is chosen based on standard English collocations and idiomatic usage.

Options:
ক. She relied (a) _____ her strong grades.
খ. She succeeded (b) _____ securing the grant.
গ. She secured the grant (c) _____ her perseverance.
ঘ. She is grateful (d) _____ everyone who supported her.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক on — (rely on) is the correct verb-preposition pairing.খ in — (succeeded in) is the usual collocation when followed by a gerund/noun phrase.গ through — (through her perseverance) means by means of or because of persistence.ঘ to — (grateful to someone) is the standard prepositional phrase.

Explanation:
ক (on): The verb 'rely' normally pairs with 'on' ('rely on someone/something'), so 'relied on her strong grades' is correct. খ (in): 'succeed' typically combines with 'in' when indicating achievement of something ('succeeded in doing something' or 'succeeded in securing the grant'). গ (through): 'through' expresses the means or agency by which something happened—'through her perseverance' means because of/by means of her perseverance. ঘ (to): 'grateful to someone' is the standard expression to show appreciation toward people; 'grateful for' is used when mentioning the thing one is thankful for ('grateful for the opportunity'). Here, because the object is 'everyone who supported her' (people), 'to' is correct.

Options:
ক. We arrived (a) _____ the summit.
খ. We arrived (b) _____ dawn.
গ. Effort we had put (c) _____ the ascent.
ঘ. We celebrated (d) _____ a small toast.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক at — (arrive at a place) is the correct preposition for 'summit'.খ at — (at dawn) is the standard time expression for that moment.গ into — (put into the ascent) indicates investment of effort in the activity.ঘ with — (celebrated with a toast) shows the means of celebration.

Explanation:
ক (at): We 'arrive at' a specific point or location such as 'the summit' (arrive in is used for larger areas like cities/countries). খ (at): Time expressions use 'at' for precise times or moments like 'at dawn', 'at noon', 'at midnight'. গ (into): The phrase 'put into' something indicates investing effort or resources in an activity—'put into the ascent' means the effort was invested in climbing. ঘ (with): 'Celebrate with a toast' is the idiomatic phrasing to indicate how the celebration was carried out; 'with' links the action to the instrument or manner of celebration.

Question:
Books offer (a) ——— knowledge, but experience provides (b) ——— wisdom. We must bridge theory (c) ——— practice. Lasting understanding grows (d) ——— reflection.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "us" — 'Books offer us knowledge' is natural because the verb 'offer' commonly takes an indirect object (someone who receives something). Here 'us' indicates the recipients of knowledge.
খ উত্তর: "practical" — 'experience provides practical wisdom' contrasts abstract book-knowledge with wisdom gained from real-life practice; 'practical' appropriately qualifies 'wisdom'.
গ উত্তর: "and" — 'bridge theory and practice' is an established collocation: we connect theoretical ideas with their application, so 'and' links the two nouns.
ঘ উত্তর: "through" — 'Lasting understanding grows through reflection' uses the preposition 'through' to indicate the means by which understanding develops.

Explanation:
Each blank calls for a word that fits both grammar and idiomatic usage. (ক) requires an object for the verb 'offer' — 'offer us knowledge' is standard. (খ) contrasts two types of insight: bookish knowledge vs. experience-based wisdom; 'practical' highlights the latter. (গ) needs a connector between 'theory' and 'practice' — the simple conjunction 'and' is correct. (ঘ) needs a preposition to express how understanding develops; 'through reflection' is the natural phrase indicating means or process.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "vast" — 'Urban life produces vast waste' correctly conveys large quantities and fits adjective + noun construction.
খ উত্তর: "welcome" — 'parks and trees bring welcome relief' uses 'welcome' as an adjective meaning 'pleasant and much appreciated', which suits the contrast with waste.
গ উত্তর: "for" — 'care for their neighbourhoods' is the idiomatic verb + preposition phrase meaning 'look after' or 'be responsible for'.
ঘ উত্তর: "with" — 'begins with small, consistent acts' uses 'with' to indicate the starting point or means by which change is initiated.

Explanation:
The sentence contrasts a problem (waste) with mitigating features (green spaces) and prescribes civic responsibility. (ক) needs an adjective expressing quantity — 'vast' fits naturally. (খ) requires an adjective describing the kind of relief parks provide; 'welcome relief' is a common collocation. (গ) calls for the idiom 'care for' meaning to look after. (ঘ) needs a preposition indicating how change starts — 'with' denotes 'by means of' and pairs naturally with 'small, consistent acts.'

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "important" — 'postpone important tasks' is the common phrase describing procrastination of meaningful work.
খ উত্তর: "with" — 'act with purpose and discipline' uses 'with' to indicate the manner or quality of acting; it links the verb to the attributes that characterize the action.
গ উত্তর: "over" — 'repeated over time' is the idiomatic way to express accumulation across a span; 'over time' means 'as time passes'.
ঘ উত্তর: "in" — 'Invest in your minutes' is a concise way to say you should allocate and use your small units of time wisely; 'invest in' is the standard verb-preposition collocation.

Explanation:
This passage emphasizes time management and habit formation. (ক) needs an adjective describing the kind of tasks people often delay — 'important' makes the point about procrastinating meaningful work. (খ) asks for a preposition that connects 'act' to the manner ('purpose and discipline') — 'with' is idiomatic. (গ) requires a preposition that conveys accumulation across duration; 'over' in 'over time' is the natural choice. (ঘ) uses the financial metaphor 'invest in' to advise deliberate use of minutes; 'in' completes that collocation.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক through
খ from

Explanation:
ক: 'through written accounts' indicates the medium by which the speaker learned about Gandhi; 'through' fits well with 'accounts'. খ: 'from tales told by my grandparents' uses 'from' to indicate source/origin of the stories. গ: 'rooted in respect' is the standard collocation: ideas are 'rooted in' principles. ঘ: 'encouraged ... to act' requires the infinitival marker 'to' after 'encouraged' when referring to urging someone to do something. These choices yield natural English: 'came to know ... through written accounts and from tales...', 'rooted in respect...', 'encouraged ... to act...'.

Question:
I first saw a photograph of Rosa Parks (a) —----- an old history book and later heard about her (b) —----- a classroom lecture. Her simple refusal to give up her seat became (c) —----- catalyst for widespread protest, and it showed how ordinary citizens could stand (d) —----- injustice.

Options:
ক. ব্ল্যাঙ্ক (a) পূরণ করুন।
খ. ব্ল্যাঙ্ক (b) পূরণ করুন।
গ. ব্ল্যাঙ্ক (c) পূরণ করুন।
ঘ. ব্ল্যাঙ্ক (d) পূরণ করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক in
খ during
গ a
ঘ against

Explanation:
ক: 'in an old history book' is the correct preposition to indicate the source where the photograph was seen. খ: 'during a classroom lecture' uses 'during' to indicate timing—when the speaker heard about her. গ: 'a catalyst' uses the indefinite article 'a' because the refusal was one catalyst among factors that sparked protest. ঘ: 'stand against injustice' is the common collocation meaning to oppose unfair treatment. Altogether: 'I first saw a photograph ... in an old history book ... during a classroom lecture ... became a catalyst ... stand against injustice.'

Question:
Mr. Karim works in a small town school. He teaches children with patience and lives a simple life. Complete the passage by filling each blank with an appropriate preposition.

Mr. Karim serves (a) —------ a teacher in the local primary school. He is content (b) —------- the little comforts of life and does not complain. He often dreams (c) —-------- visiting historical places but cannot afford to travel. He refrains (d) —------- asking for financial help from his neighbours.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (a).
খ. Fill the blank (b).
গ. Fill the blank (c).
ঘ. Fill the blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: at — "serves at a teacher in the local primary school." (more natural: "serves as a teacher at the local primary school")

খ উত্তর: with — "content with the little comforts"

গ উত্তর: of — "dreams of visiting historical places"

ঘ উত্তর: from — "refrains from asking for financial help"

Explanation:
ক (at): The verb 'serve' when followed by a role/place commonly uses 'at' to indicate location or institution (e.g., 'serves at the hospital/school'). Note that 'serves as a teacher' is the correct phrase to describe his role; combining both, the most natural phrasing is 'serves as a teacher at the local primary school.'

খ (with): 'content' is followed by the preposition 'with' to indicate satisfaction regarding something (content with the little comforts).

গ (of): 'dream' takes 'of' when followed by the object of a wish or aspiration (dreams of visiting …).

ঘ (from): 'refrain' pairs with 'from' to show abstaining from an action (refrains from asking). These are standard collocations in English and are used to indicate relationships between verbs/adjectives and their complements.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (a).
খ. Fill the blank (b).
গ. Fill the blank (c).
ঘ. Fill the blank (d).

খ উত্তর: on — "rely on her for fresh morning loaves"

গ উত্তর: in — "generous in giving unsold items"

ঘ উত্তর: about — "worries about slower business"

Explanation:
ক (at): The adjective 'skilled' often takes 'at' when followed by an activity (skilled at making X).

খ (on): 'rely' requires 'on' to show dependence (rely on someone for something).

গ (in): 'generous' commonly pairs with 'in' when followed by an -ing clause describing the action someone is generous in doing (generous in donating/giving).

ঘ (about): 'worry' is typically followed by 'about' to indicate the topic of concern (worries about slower business). These prepositions are standard collocations and convey the intended relationships naturally.

Rafi is a young mural painter who cares about his heritage. Choose the correct prepositions to complete the passage.

Rafi is deeply concerned (a) —------- preserving traditional motifs in his work. He often succeeds (b) —--------- conveying emotions through bold colours and texture. The city art council praised him (c) —--------- his commitment to cultural education. He tries to save (d) —-------- buying better quality paints and brushes.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (a).
খ. Fill the blank (b).
গ. Fill the blank (c).
ঘ. Fill the blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: with — "concerned with preserving traditional motifs"

খ উত্তর: in — "succeeds in conveying emotions"

গ উত্তর: for — "praised him for his commitment"

ঘ উত্তর: for — "save for buying better quality paints" (alternatively 'to' as in 'save to buy')

Explanation:
ক (with): 'concerned' is often followed by 'with' when indicating the subject or matter of concern (concerned with preserving X).

খ (in): 'succeed' is used with 'in' to indicate achievement of an action (succeeds in doing something).

গ (for): 'praise' takes 'for' to indicate the reason someone is praised (praised for his commitment).

ঘ (for/to): 'save' can be followed by 'for' when saving money for a purpose (save for buying X). Another common construction is 'save to buy' (infinitive), but 'for' is a preposition and fits the fill-in-the-blank pattern expected here. The choice depends slightly on style, but both express purpose: either 'save for buying' or 'save to buy.'

খ: বাক্যে 'several students ——— their lives' দেওয়ার সময় সাধারণত 'sacrificed' বা 'lost' ব্যবহৃত হয়; এখানে 'sacrificed' বেশি প্রাসঙ্গিক কারণ তারা জীবনের ত্যাগ করেছেন।
গ: 'The courage ... led to the later movement' — কোনো কারণকে ফলাফলে পৌঁছে দেওয়া বোঝাতে 'led to' ব্যবহার করা হয়।

ক for
খ above
গ in
ঘ through

Dear Riya,

Thank you for your warm letter (a) -------- time. We heard you passed the audition and we are very proud (b) ----- you. Please write soon (c) ------ your new address. Remember to come (d) ---- a visit when you are free.

Yours,
Meena

Options:
ক. (a) -------- time.
খ. (b) ----- you.
গ. (c) ------ your new address.
ঘ. (d) ---- a visit when you are free.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক at the right time
খ of you
গ with your new address
ঘ for a visit

Explanation:
ক: "at the right time" fits because the writer thanks Riya for sending a letter at a convenient or timely moment; this multi-word prepositional phrase is natural in this context. 

খ: "proud of you" is the correct collocation in English—"proud" is usually followed by the preposition "of" when indicating the person one feels proud about. 

গ: "write soon with your new address" is idiomatic: we often ask someone to "write" and include the information "with" the message (i.e., send the letter that contains the new address). "About" could also work in some variants, but "with" emphasizes including the address in the letter. 

ঘ: "come for a visit" is the standard English phrase meaning to visit someone for social reasons. The preposition "for" is used with "a visit."

Sincerely,
Dr. Rahman

Options:
ক. (a) ------- the meeting.
খ. (b) ------- a prior commitment.
গ. (c) ------- any inconvenience caused.
ঘ. (d) ------- the committee's discussion.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক to the meeting
খ due to a prior commitment
গ for any inconvenience caused
ঘ of the committee's discussion

Explanation:
ক: The correct collocation is "invitation to the meeting." We use "to" when indicating the event or occasion for which someone is invited. 

খ: "absent due to a prior commitment" uses "due to" to explain the reason for absence; it is a formal and appropriate phrase in a polite letter. 

গ: "apologies for any inconvenience" is the fixed phrase used when expressing regret about problems caused; "for" is the proper preposition after "apologies." 

ঘ: "minutes of the committee's discussion" is the standard phrase: "minutes of" (an account of) the meeting/discussion. "Of" links the minutes to the subject (the committee's discussion).

গ. (c) ------- your joining date
ঘ. (d) ------- coffee soon.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:

খ for you
গ about your joining date
ঘ over coffee

Explanation:
ক: "Congratulations on your new job" is the standard expression; "on" is used with "congratulations" followed by the achievement or occasion. 

খ: "thrilled for you" is the natural idiom meaning the speaker is happy on the other person's behalf. ("Thrilled with you" would change the meaning to excited together; "thrilled about you" is uncommon here.) 

গ: "let me know about your joining date" is the common way to request information regarding the date; "about" introduces the topic (the joining date). 

ঘ: "catch up over coffee" is an idiomatic phrase meaning to meet and talk while having coffee; "over" is the usual preposition in this collocation.

ঘ. পূরণ করুন শূন্যস্থান (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক about
খ off
গ up to
ঘ predating

Explanation:
ক: 'about' এখানে সংখ্যার আনুমানিকতা দেখায়; 'about 1,200 miles' মানে প্রায় ১২০০ মাইল দূরে।

খ: 'off' সাধারণভাবে দ্বীপ বা প্রবালশ্রেণীর কেন্দ্র থেকে কোনো উপকূল রৈখিক দূরত্ব নির্দেশ করতে ব্যবহৃত হয় — 'off the coast of Ecuador'।

গ: 'up to' ব্যবহার করে বলা যায় যে কিছুর উচ্চতা সর্বোচ্চ পর্যন্ত ছিল — 'up to thirty feet' মানে প্রায় ত্রিশ ফুট পর্যন্ত। 'as high as' ও ব্যবহার করা যেত, তবে 'up to' এখানে সংক্ষিপ্ত ও প্রাকৃতিক।

ঘ: 'predating' মানে কোনো ঘটনা অন্য ঘটনার আগে ঘটেছে; 'predating the arrival of modern cartographers' বলতে বোঝায় আগেই আগলিত্যাভাবে জ্বালন সংঘটিত হয়েছিল, মানচিত্র নির্মাতারা তা নথিভুক্ত করার আগে থেকেই। বিকল্প হিসেবে 'long before' বসিয়ে বাক্যটি 'long before the arrival of modern cartographers' করেও বলা যেত।

Solution:

খ south of
গ contained
ঘ including

Explanation:
ক: 'about' দিয়ে আনুমানিক দূরত্ব বোঝানো হয়েছে — 'about 400 miles'।

খ: 'south of' ব্যবহার করে উপকূল বা সমুদ্র থেকে দক্ষিণে অবস্থান নির্দেশ করা হয় — '400 miles south of the Mediterranean' মানে ভূমি সমুদ্ররেখার থেকে ৪০০ মাইল দক্ষিণে।

গ: 'contained' এখানে বোঝায় যে সেই প্যানেলগুলিতে এমন দৃশ্য ছিল; বিকল্পভাবে 'showed' ব্যবহার করা যেত। Grammatically, 'some contained vivid hunting scenes' প্রাকৃতিক শোনায়।

ঘ: 'including' দিয়ে বলা হচ্ছে যে সেই বিশদে বিশেষ কিছু বিষয়ও ছিল — 'including even the choice of weapons' মানে এমনকি যে অস্ত্রগুলো ব্যবহৃত হত তাও দেখানো আছে।

Explanation:

খ: 'off' এখানে সমুদ্রের মধ্যে কোনো উপকূল থেকে দূরত্ব বোঝাতে ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে — '3 miles off the coast' মানে উপকূল থেকে তিন মাইল সমুদ্রে।

গ: 'dating back' বলতে বোঝায় সেই পরিব্যাপ্ত বস্তুগুলো নির্দিষ্ট শতাব্দী বা যুগ থেকে এসেছে — 'dating back several centuries'।

ঘ: 'bearing' মানে কোনো বস্তুতে কোনো চিহ্ন বা লেখা থাকা; 'bearing inscriptions' অর্থ সেই অ্যামফোরাগুলোর উপরে শিলালিপি বা লেখাযুক্ত ছিল। বিকল্প হিসেবে 'with' ব্যবহার করা যেত, কিন্তু 'bearing' অধিক নির্দিষ্ট ও পেশাগত শব্দ।

ক: 'Scholarship awarded for merit and perseverance' — 'for' indicates reason or cause. খ: 'Dedication to the upliftment of others' — 'dedication to' is the correct collocation, showing the object of dedication. গ: 'Act with integrity' — 'with' indicates the manner in which one acts. ঘ: 'Never waver from your principles' — 'waver from' is the appropriate phrasal verb meaning to deviate away from; thus 'from' is required.

Question:
Dear Tania,

I heard you no longer want (a) _____ take piano lessons. Have you lost interest (b) _____ them? Remember, no one becomes a master (c) _____ practice alone or overnight. Only (d) _____ regular lessons can you truly master the instrument.

Yours,

Rivu

Options:
ক. (a) Fill the blank before 'take piano lessons'.
খ. (b) Fill the blank in 'lost interest _____ them'.
গ. (c) Fill the blank in 'a master _____ practice alone'.
ঘ. (d) Fill the blank in 'Only _____ regular lessons'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক to
খ in
গ without
ঘ through

Explanation:
ক (to): After the verb 'want' we use the infinitive marker 'to' before another verb: 'want to take'.

খ (in): The phrase is 'lose interest in something', so the correct preposition is 'in'.

গ (without): The sentence contrasts mastery with lack of practice: 'a master without practice' is the intended meaning.

ঘ (through): The phrase 'only through regular lessons' means 'by means of' or 'as a result of' regular lessons; 'through' is the correct preposition here.

Cheers,

Rivu

Options:
ক. (a) Fill the blank in 'don't want _____ work extra shifts'.
খ. (b) Fill the blank in 'bothering you _____ this job'.
গ. (c) Fill the blank in 'comes _____ hard work'.
ঘ. (d) Fill the blank in 'Only _____ steady effort'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক to
খ about
গ through
ঘ with

Explanation:
ক (to): After 'don't want' we use the infinitive marker 'to' before the verb: 'don't want to work'.

খ (about): The usual collocation is 'bothering you about something' meaning causing concern regarding that thing.

গ (through): The idiom 'comes through hard work' (or more fully 'comes through hard work and patience') uses 'through' to express means or cause.

ঘ (with): 'Only with steady effort will you achieve your goals' expresses that steady effort is the necessary condition; 'with' is the correct preposition here.

Warmly,

Rivu

খ. (b) Fill the blank in 'upset _____ this'.
গ. (c) Fill the blank in 'rarely comes _____ a night'.
ঘ. (d) Fill the blank in 'Only _____ consistent exposure'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক to
খ about
গ in
ঘ through

Explanation:
ক (to): After 'decided not' the infinitive marker 'to' is used before the verb: 'decided not to attend'.

খ (about): The phrase 'upset about this' is the normal way to indicate what is causing upset.

গ (in): The idiom 'comes in a night' (often phrased 'overnight') uses 'in' to indicate the short time span; 'rarely comes in a night' means it is not achieved immediately.

ঘ (through): 'Only through consistent exposure will your speaking improve' uses 'through' to indicate the means by which improvement happens.

খ. শূন্যস্থান (b) পূরণ করুন।

ঘ. শূন্যস্থান (d) পূরণ করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক and
খ for the
গ for
ঘ for

Explanation:
ক: 'and' — বাক্যটি বলছে যে স্বেচ্ছাসেবীরা তাঁদের 'time' এবং 'skills' উভয়ই দান করে; দুইটি আইটেম যোগ করার জন্য 'and' ব্যবহার করি।

খ: 'for the' — এখানে উদ্দেশ্য বা লাভ ব্যাখ্যা করার জন্য 'for the benefit of local people' এক স্ট্যান্ডার্ড প্রবন্ধ; 'for the' পুরো ফ্রেজটি পূর্ণ করে।

গ: 'for' — 'working for community welfare' বলতে বোঝায় 'কমিউনিটির কল্যাণের জন্য কাজ করা'। প্রিপোজিশন 'for' এখানে উদ্দেশ্য/উপকার বোঝায়।

ঘ: 'for' — 'with pride for years to come' বলতে বোঝায় যে তারা ভবিষ্যৎ বহু বছর ধরে গর্বের সাথে তাদের সেবাকে স্মরণ করবে; সময় বা স্থায়িত্ব বোঝাতে 'for' ব্যবহার করা হয়।

খ. শূন্যস্থান (b) পূরণ করুন।
গ. শূন্যস্থান (c) পূরণ করুন।
ঘ. শূন্যস্থান (d) পূরণ করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক and
খ and
গ through
ঘ from

Explanation:
ক: 'and' — এখানে তিনটি ক্রিয়া (planting trees, reducing waste, choosing sustainable products) একসাথে তালিকাভুক্ত করা হয়েছে; পরস্পর যোগ করার জন্য 'and' প্রয়োজ্য।

খ: 'and' — উপরের মতো, তালিকার অংশ হিসেবে আবার 'and' ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে যাতে বাক্য সঠিকভাবে বিভিন্ন কার্যকলাপকে সংযুক্ত করে।

গ: 'through' — সরকারকে কঠোর বিধিমালা প্রণয়নের মাধ্যমে পদক্ষেপ নিতে বলা হচ্ছে; 'act through strict regulations' মানে 'কঠোর বিধিনিষেধের মাধ্যমে কার্যকর ব্যবস্থা গ্রহণ'। 'by' ও সম্ভব হলেও 'through' এখানে পদ্ধতিগত ব্যবস্থা নির্দেশ করতে স্বচ্ছ।

ঘ: 'from' — 'benefit from our efforts' অর্থাৎ ভবিষ্যৎ প্রজন্ম আমাদের প্রচেষ্টার কারণে লাভবান হবে; লাভের উৎস নির্দেশ করতে 'from' ব্যবহৃত হয়।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক and
খ and
গ in
ঘ on

Explanation:
ক: 'and' — 'read widely and engage critically'—এই দুটি ক্রিয়াকে সংযুক্ত করতে 'and' ব্যবহৃত হয়।

খ: 'and' — তালিকার তৃতীয় অংশ 'discuss ideas with peers' যুক্ত করার জন্যও 'and' দরকার; বাক্যটি ধারাবাহিক ক্রিয়াকলাপ নির্দেশ করছে।

গ: 'in' — 'play a role in facilitating...' প্রাকটিসে সাধারণ অভিব্যক্তি; 'role in' মানে কোনো ব্যাপারে ভূমিকা থাকা বা অংশগ্রহণ করা।

ঘ: 'on' — 'depends not only on talent but also on perseverance' হচ্ছে স্ট্যান্ডার্ড কাঠামো; কোনো কিছুর উপর নির্ভরশীলতা জানাতে 'on' ব্যবহার করা হয়।

Question:
A young gardener knelt (a) ----- the old oak and spread compost (b) ----- the roots. He hummed softly (c) ----- the morning breeze, watching the robins hop (d) ----- the wet soil.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক beneath খ around গ in ঘ across

Explanation:
ক (beneath): 'Kneel beneath the old oak' emphasizes position directly under the tree; 'under' would also be acceptable, but 'beneath' sounds natural in this poetic context. খ (around): Compost is spread 'around the roots' to encircle and cover them; 'around' shows distribution surrounding the roots. গ (in): Humming 'in the morning breeze' indicates the gardener and his sound are within the gentle breeze; 'with' could work but 'in' conveys being surrounded by the breeze. ঘ (across): Robins hopping 'across the wet soil' shows movement from one side to another over the soil; 'over' might be used but 'across' stresses horizontal movement.

Options:

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক at খ before গ at ঘ in

Explanation:
ক (at): We 'arrive at the station'—'at' is the standard preposition for arriving at a specific place. খ (before): 'Just before sunset' situates the time slightly earlier than sunset; 'around' could be possible but 'before' makes the sequence clear. গ (at): One 'glances at the timetable'—'at' is used with 'glance' to indicate the object of the look. ঘ (in): He decided to wait 'in the coffee shop nearby'—'in' indicates being inside that establishment; 'at the coffee shop' would indicate the location in general, but 'in' emphasizes being inside while waiting.

Correct Answer:

ক on খ at গ past ঘ behind

Explanation:
ক (on): The cat 'perched on the windowsill'—'on' is the natural preposition for resting atop a narrow surface. খ (at): It 'stared at the street below'—'stare at' names the target of the gaze. গ (past): A bicycle 'rolled past' indicates it moved by the scene; 'by' or 'past' both work, but 'past' emphasizes motion alongside the viewpoint. ঘ (behind): The cat 'darted behind the curtain' to hide; 'behind' specifies the location it moved to for concealment (alternatively 'into' could suggest moving through, but 'behind' fits 'vanished' best).

The annual science fair at our school was a lively affair. The event commenced (a) ——— 10 am. The headmistress presided (b) ——— the inauguration.

Options:
ক. The event commenced (a) ——— 10 am.
খ. The headmistress presided (b) ——— the inauguration.
গ. The opening was marked (c) ——— a ribbon cutting by a renowned scientist.
ঘ. A senior student demonstrated a model (d) ——— the audience.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: at
খ উত্তর: over
গ উত্তর: by
ঘ উত্তর: to

Explanation:
ক — 'at 10 am' is the standard expression to indicate a specific time. Use 'at' before clock times (e.g., at 7 pm, at noon).

খ — 'presided over' is the correct collocation: a person presides over a meeting, ceremony or function. 'Preside' by itself needs the preposition 'over' when indicating authority or control of an event.

গ — 'marked by' is used to indicate that an event had a particular distinguishing action or sign (e.g., the opening was marked by a ribbon cutting). 'With' could also work in some contexts ('opened with a ribbon cutting'), but 'marked by' emphasizes that the ribbon cutting characterized the opening.

ঘ — 'demonstrated ... to the audience' is the normal pattern: demonstrate something to someone. The preposition 'to' indicates the recipients or observers of the demonstration.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

খ উত্তর: to
গ উত্তর: at
ঘ উত্তর: to

Explanation:
ক — 'began with' is the usual phrase to indicate what action started the event (e.g., began with the lighting of the lamp).

খ — 'performed to' is used when describing music or dance accompanied by particular tunes: they danced/performed to traditional folk tunes. 'To' links the performance and the music.

গ — 'at the end' is the idiomatic expression to indicate timing: something happened at the end of the event. (Other options like 'by the end' change the nuance: 'by the end' means before or at some point up to the end.)

ঘ — 'encouraged students to participate' uses the verb 'encourage' followed by 'to' + infinitive. The pattern is encourage somebody to do something.

ক — 'started with' indicates the first activity that kicked off the campaign; 'with' links the campaign and the rally that began it.

খ — 'registered at the registration desk' uses 'at' to show location: people register at a desk or at a counter.

গ — 'classes for beginners' is the standard collocation: classes intended for beginners are described as 'for beginners.' Using 'to' or 'on' would change the meaning (e.g., 'on beginners' would be incorrect here).

ঘ — 'appealed to the public' is the correct pattern: 'appeal to' someone means to make a request or plea directed at them. The structure is 'appealed to the public to support...'.

গ: 'My project dealt with renewable energy' — the verb 'deal' typically takes the preposition 'with' when indicating the subject matter.

Question:
I returned yesterday from a short trip to the hills. We left early (a) ——— morning so we could enjoy the sunrise and reached the top (b) ——— noon. The weather stayed pleasant throughout the day and we explored the trails (c) ——— care. We got back home safely (d) ——— night.

Options:
ক. (a) ——— morning
খ. (b) ——— noon
গ. (c) ——— care
ঘ. (d) ——— night


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক in
খ by
গ with
ঘ at

Explanation:
ক: 'in the morning' — the standard preposition for parts of the day is 'in' (except 'at night' and 'at noon').

খ: 'by noon' — 'by' indicates that something happened at or before that time; 'by noon' means we reached no later than noon. 'at noon' would mean exactly at 12:00.

গ: 'with care' — 'with' expresses manner (how we explored: carefully), 'with care' is correct. Alternatively 'carefully' (an adverb) could be used.

ঘ: 'at night' — the conventional preposition for 'night' is 'at'.

গ on (answer: "on")

ঘ at (answer: "at")

Explanation:

These choices reflect common collocations in English (verbs of movement, discussion prepositions, time prepositions, and place prepositions).

These choices reflect conventional English usage for journeys, social interactions, time expressions, and invitations.

Question:
Dear Anik,

I read your note and feel concerned because your university entrance test is only weeks away. I hope you are preparing well. Please listen to a few tips: make a study chart, reserving time (a) ——- focused revision; set short goals (b) ——- each topic; practise past papers (c) ——- simulate exam conditions; and sleep early (d) ——- maintain concentration.

Options:
ক. Fill (a)
খ. Fill (b)
গ. Fill (c)
ঘ. Fill (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক about focused revision
খ for each topic
গ to simulate exam conditions
ঘ to maintain concentration

Explanation:
ক: 'about' is used with 'reserving time about X' to indicate the time is intended for that activity; in this context, reserving time about focused revision (alternative phrasing: 'for focused revision' is also acceptable, but 'about' emphasizes concern/attention).

খ: 'for' is the correct preposition to show purpose—short goals set for each topic.

গ: 'to' expresses purpose here—practising past papers to simulate exam conditions (i.e., the purpose of practising).

ঘ: 'to' again expresses purpose—sleep early to maintain concentration. Each chosen preposition links an action to its intended purpose or recipient.

Respected Students,

The inter-school sports meet is close. Please take precautions. Be careful (a) ——- injuries during warm-ups, train (b) ——- discipline and teamwork, aim (c) ——- your personal best in every event, and never miss practice (d) ——- any excuse.

Options:
ক. Fill (a)
খ. Fill (b)
গ. Fill (c)
ঘ. Fill (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক about injuries
খ in discipline
গ for your personal best
ঘ for any excuse

Explanation:
ক: 'be careful about injuries' is idiomatic—'about' is used to indicate the matter of concern.

খ: 'train in discipline' correctly uses 'in' to indicate the area/quality being developed (discipline, teamwork).

গ: 'aim for your personal best' uses 'for' to indicate the goal or target one is striving to achieve.

ঘ: 'never miss practice for any excuse' uses 'for' to indicate reason—i.e., do not allow any excuse to be the reason to skip practice. Each preposition fits standard collocations and shows the relationship between action and purpose/concern.

Question:
Dear Sara,

Your summer internship will start soon. Try to balance responsibilities: divide hours (a) ——- study and internship tasks, prefer to study (b) ——- morning when you are fresh, keep evenings (c) ——- finishing reports and assignments, and take short walks (d) ——- avoid tiredness.

Options:
ক. Fill (a)
খ. Fill (b)
গ. Fill (c)
ঘ. Fill (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক between study and internship tasks
খ in the morning
গ for finishing reports and assignments
ঘ to avoid tiredness

Explanation:
ক: 'between' is the proper preposition to indicate distribution of time or resources across two areas (study and internship tasks).

খ: 'in the morning' is the standard phrase indicating the time of day when an activity is done; 'prefer to study in the morning' reads naturally.

গ: 'for finishing reports and assignments' uses 'for' to indicate purpose—the reason those evenings are reserved.

ঘ: 'to avoid tiredness' uses 'to' to express purpose—taking walks for the purpose of preventing tiredness. Each selection follows common English collocations that link actions to their purposes, timings, or distributions.

Question:
A good teacher not only explains facts (a) —----- his students but also guides them (b) —----- hands-on activities. He values understanding (c) —----- rote learning and relates topics (d) —----- everyday life.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (a)
খ. Fill the blank (b)
গ. Fill the blank (c)
ঘ. Fill the blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক to — 'explains to his students' indicates the recipient of explanation.
খ through — 'guides them through hands-on activities' shows the means or method used.
গ over — 'values understanding over rote learning' expresses preference or contrast.
ঘ to — 'relates topics to everyday life' links the subject to something else.

Explanation:
Each blank requires a preposition that fits the verb and the intended relationship in context. (a) 'explain' typically takes 'to' when indicating the person receiving the explanation (explain something to someone). (b) 'guide through' is a common collocation meaning to lead by means of or during a process; 'through' indicates the method (hands-on activities). (c) When comparing two things and indicating preference, 'over' is used (prefer A over B); here the teacher values understanding more than rote learning. (d) 'Relate to' is the standard verb–preposition pair used to connect one thing with another, so 'to' correctly links topics and everyday life.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (a)
খ. Fill the blank (b)

(b) 'Participate in' is the established phrase when joining events or activities. (c) 'Harmful to' indicates the target of harm; 'harmful for' is sometimes heard but 'to' is more idiomatic with 'wildlife.' (d) 'Made from' indicates what material was used to produce an item (e.g., 'made from recycled paper').

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (a)

Explanation:
These choices reflect idiomatic English usage: (a) 'divide between' is used when splitting something into parts allocated to two or more things. (b) 'By priority' indicates the method or basis for organizing tasks — you group or order tasks according to their priority. (c) Many verbs pair with specific prepositions; 'adhere to' means to stick to or follow. (d) 'At regular intervals' is the common phrase describing repetition happening every fixed period.

During the neighbourhood workshop volunteers repaired the playground, painted benches and planted saplings. Complete the short sentences below by filling the blanks with appropriate prepositions or particles.

Options:
ক. We started the work (a) ——— sunrise and finished (b) ——— noon.
খ. Children swung happily (a) ——— the swings while parents painted the benches (b) ——— bright colours.
গ. The organiser thanked everyone (a) ——— their help and advised them to be careful (b) ——— the wet paint.
ঘ. A new flower bed was created (a) ——— the vacant space (b) ——— the eastern fence to welcome visitors.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) at; (b) by
খ (a) on; (b) in
গ (a) for; (b) about
ঘ (a) in; (b) along

Explanation:
ক: "at sunrise" is the standard collocation for the time the work began. "by noon" indicates completion before or at that time (deadline point).

খ: People sit or play "on the swings." Benches are painted "in bright colours" (painted using/with those colours or finished in those colours).

গ: One is "thanked for" help (the preposition for expresses reason). Being "careful about the wet paint" is the natural English collocation (careful about X = take care regarding X).

ঘ: You plant something "in the vacant space" (inside that area). Planting "along the eastern fence" means the location follows the boundary; "along" expresses adjacency/lengthwise placement.

খ (a) by; (b) of

Explanation:
ক: Demonstrations are done "on a small scale" (on + scale). Materials that make up something are expressed with "from recycled materials." 

খ: People are typically "impressed by" something (agent or cause). The phrase "the simplicity of the overall design" uses "of" to link simplicity to the design.

গ: Projects "focus on" topics (focus on X). The location affected is "in the school canteen" (where the reduction should occur).

ঘ: You praise someone "for" a skill or action (for their presentation). To advance a project one moves it "to prototype stage" (to + target stage).

গ: Stalls are set up "for selling" (purpose: for X). The purpose of selling is "to raise funds" (infinitive to express purpose).

ঘ. Please be careful (d) —----- your punctuality from now on.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক about
খ with
গ about
ঘ about

Explanation:
ক: 'learn/come to know about' is the correct collocation — we say 'I came to know about your habit'.

খ: 'careless with time' is the natural idiom meaning someone does not take care regarding time—'careless about time' can be used but 'careless with time' is more idiomatic here.

গ: 'worried about your future' is the standard phrase: we are 'worried about' something.

ঘ: 'be careful about your punctuality' means pay attention to or take care regarding punctuality; 'about' fits naturally with 'be careful'.

With love,

Options:
ক. I heard (a) —----- you have started buying things online almost every day.
খ. You seem addicted (b) —----- shopping.
গ. It is harmful (c) —----- your savings.
ঘ. Please try to abstain (d) —----- unnecessary purchases.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক that
খ to
গ to
ঘ from

Explanation:
ক: 'I heard that you have started...' — 'that' introduces the reported clause and is the normal connector after 'heard'.

খ: 'addicted to shopping' — the fixed prepositional phrase is 'addicted to' + noun/gerund.

গ: 'harmful to your savings' — we use 'harmful to' when saying something damages or negatively affects something.

ঘ: 'abstain from' is the correct verb–preposition combination meaning 'stop yourself from doing something'; so 'abstain from unnecessary purchases' is correct.

ক. Yesterday I noticed (a) —----- you using your mobile during the meeting.
খ. Such behaviour shows a lack (b) —----- professionalism and respect towards colleagues.
গ. Kindly refrain (c) —----- using phones in meetings
ঘ. and focus (d) —----- the discussion.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক that
খ of
গ from
ঘ on

Explanation:
ক: 'I noticed that you were using...' — 'that' introduces the observed clause (alternatively 'I noticed you using' is possible, but 'that' + clause is fully correct).

খ: 'a lack of professionalism' — the noun 'lack' commonly takes 'of' to show what is missing.

গ: 'refrain from' is the correct collocation meaning 'stop doing' or 'avoid doing'.

ঘ: 'focus on the discussion' — we 'focus on' a topic or activity; 'on' is the correct preposition here.

Correct Answer:

Explanation:
ক: 'Wondered about' is the common collocation when thinking or being curious about something. 'Wondered of' is incorrect here. খ: 'in the city' indicates location; 'at the city' or 'on the city' would be incorrect. গ: 'gather to access' — the infinitive 'to access' shows purpose. Alternatives like 'for access' change nuance and are less natural here. ঘ: 'provided via a wireless router' correctly indicates the means; 'by a wireless router' could also be acceptable, but 'via' emphasizes the channel (through the router).

'Interact to' would be incorrect. গ: 'Organized into modules' expresses division or structure—'in modules' is possible but 'into' emphasizes how content is grouped. ঘ: 'Submitted through the portal' or 'via the portal' indicates the channel used for submission; 'on the portal' is also possible but less precise about transmission.

Options:

খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: about

খ Answer: at

গ Answer: with

ঘ Answer: in

Explanation:
ক (about): We use 'worried about someone' to indicate concern regarding that person.

খ (at): 'feel at my new room' — more natural is 'feel at home' or 'feel comfortable in my new room'; here 'at' fits fixed phrase 'feel at [place]' when short. If the sentence were 'I feel quite at home in my new room' the preposition 'in' would follow 'home'. Contextually 'at' marks location/feeling.

গ (with): 'help someone with something' is the usual collocation: the library helps me with my studies.

ঘ (in): 'enrolled in a club' is the correct preposition for membership or participation ('enroll in a course/club').

Question:
In a little mountain village the evening settled quietly. As dusk fell [1] the rooftops, the old clockmaker wound the ancient bell [2] the church and stood listening [3] the calm. He often recalled the year he had been apprenticed [4] a kindly master who taught him patience.

Options:
ক. শূন্যস্থান [1]-এ সঠিক প্রিপোজিশন (preposition) বসান।
খ. শূন্যস্থান [2]-এ সঠিক প্রিপোজিশন বসান।
গ. শূন্যস্থান [3]-এ সঠিক প্রিপোজিশন বসান।
ঘ. শূন্যস্থান [4]-এ সঠিক প্রিপোজিশন বসান।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক over
খ of
গ to
ঘ to

Explanation:
ক (over): ইংরেজিতে dusk fell over the rooftops প্রচলিত অভিব্যক্তি — 'dusk fell over' মানে সন্ধ্যা ছড়িয়ে পড়ল, অতএব প্রিপোজিশন 'over' উপযুক্ত।

খ (of): 'the bell of the church' — ঘণ্টা কোন কিছুর অংশ/সংক্রান্ত হলে 'of' ব্যবহার হয়; 'bell in the church' হলেও চলে কিন্তু এখানে 'of' স্বাভাবিক এবং নির্ভুল।

গ (to): 'listened to the calm' — শুনতে কারো/কিছুর দিকে 'listen to' ফ্রেজটি ব্যবহার করা হয়; সুতরাং 'to' দরকার।

ঘ (to): 'apprenticed to a master' — কারোর কাছে এবং কারো অধীনে শিক্ষানবিশ হওয়া বোঝাতে ইংরেজিতে 'apprenticed to' ব্যবহার করা হয়।

Question:
The tide rolled in and finally drew the small ship home. When the boat eased [1] the harbor, the captain breathed easier. He stepped [2] deck, shaded his eyes and scanned [3] the distant line for any sign of land. Years ago they had sailed [4] a fierce storm and came back with stories of survival.

Options:
ক. শূন্যস্থান [1]-এ সঠিক প্রিপোজিশন বসান।
খ. শূন্যস্থান [2]-এ সঠিক প্রিপোজিশন বসান।
গ. শূন্যস্থান [3]-এ সঠিক প্রিপোজিশন বসান।
ঘ. শূন্যস্থান [4]-এ সঠিক প্রিপোজিশন বসান।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক into
খ on
গ toward
ঘ through

Explanation:
ক (into): 'ease into the harbor' বা 'come into the harbor'—জাহাজ যখন বন্দরে প্রবেশ করে তখন 'into' ব্যবহার করা হয়।

খ (on): 'stepped on deck' — ডেকের উপর পা রাখার অর্থে 'on deck' প্রচলিত; 'onto' ও ব্যবহার হতে পারে কিন্তু এখানে 'on' স্বাভাবিক ও সঠিক।

গ (toward): 'scanned toward the distant line' বা 'looked toward the horizon'—নির্দিষ্ট কোন দিকে দৃষ্টি গেলে 'toward/towards' যথোপযুক্ত; 'at'ও সম্ভব কিন্তু 'toward' এখানে দৃষ্টির গমন নির্দেশ করে।

ঘ (through): 'sailed through a storm' — ঝড়ের মধ্য দিয়ে সফর করার জন্য 'through' ব্যবহার করা হয়; 'in' বা 'during' অল্প ভিন্ন অর্থ বহন করে।

Question:
On a rainy night the city library glowed warmly. By midnight the lights shone [1] the rain and she sat hunched [2] a tall stack of reference books, studying notes by the flicker [3] the lamp. Her classmates often laughed gently [4] her habit of pulling all‑nighters, but she felt most alive then.

Options:
ক. শূন্যস্থান [1]-এ সঠিক প্রিপোজিশন বসান।
খ. শূন্যস্থান [2]-এ সঠিক প্রিপোজিশন বসান।

ক through

গ (of/by): দুটোই গ্রামাটিক্যালি সম্ভব: 'studying notes by the flicker of the lamp' খুব স্বাভাবিক (ল্যাম্পের ঝলকানি দ্বারা আলো পেয়ে)। 'of' সম্পর্কেও চলে ('the flicker of the lamp')—এখানে 'by' কাজে করে ক্রিয়া‑সামঞ্জস্য দেখাতে।

ঘ (for): 'laughed gently for her habit' — 'for' ব্যবহারে কিছুর জন্য কাউকে হাস্যকর মনে করা বা মিশুক ব্যঙ্গ করা বোঝায়; তাই 'for' উপযুক্ত।

ক — 'on' ব্যবহৃত হয় নির্দিষ্ট দিন বা তারিখ উল্লেখ করতে: 'on Monday'।

খ — 'because of' একটি পার্সনাল/কজুয়াল কারণ দেখাতে ব্যবহৃত হয়; এখানে 'an emergency' কেন মিলিটার নেই তাই 'because of an emergency' করতে হবে।

গ — 'with my family' মানে 'আমার পরিবারের সঙ্গে' বা 'পরিবারের সমস্যা/ঘটনায়'—এখানে 'with' উপযুক্ত। (বিকল্প হিসেবে context অনুযায়ী 'involving my family'ও ব্যবহার করা যায়।)

Warm regards,
Team

Options:
ক. (a) পূরণ করুন
খ. (b) পূরণ করুন
গ. (c) পূরণ করুন
ঘ. (d) পূরণ করুন


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক about
খ of
গ for
ঘ with

Explanation:
ক — 'heard about your promotion' হলো সাধারণ ব্যবহার যখন কোনো খবর সম্পর্কে শুনেছি। 'heard your promotion' (বিনা preposition) অস্বাভাবিক শোনায়।

খ — 'proud of you' একটি স্থায়ী collocation; 'proud' পরবর্তী ক্ষেত্রে 'of' লাগে: 'proud of you'।

গ — সময়কাল বোঝাতে 'for months' ব্যবহার করা হয়; এখানে কাজ করার সময়কাল নির্দেশ করছে তাই 'for' সঠিক।

ঘ — 'celebrate with us' মানে 'আমাদের সঙ্গে উদযাপন করো' — এখানে 'with' সঠিক প্রিপোজিশন।

সামগ্রিকভাবে প্রতিটি শব্দগুচ্ছ বাক্যে স্বাভাবিক ও চলিত ইংরেজি ব্যবহার নিশ্চিত করে।

Nadia

Options:
ক. (a) পূরণ করুন
খ. (b) পূরণ করুন
গ. (c) পূরণ করুন
ঘ. (d) পূরণ করুন


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক from
খ on
গ in
ঘ although

Explanation:
ক — 'from the postman' নির্দেশ করে প্রাপকের উৎস বা যিনি পাঠিয়েছেন; প্যাকেট যিনি দিয়েছেন তিনি 'the postman'।

খ — একটি নির্দিষ্ট দিন নির্দেশ করতে 'on Thursday' ব্যবহার করা হয় (day + on)।

গ — 'in the morning' একটি সময়কাল/পিরিয়ড বোঝায়; 'on the morning' খুবই নির্দিষ্ট ক্ষেত্রে ব্যবহার করা যেতে পারে ('on the morning of the wedding') তবে সাধারণত 'in the morning' সঠিক।

ঘ — বাক্যটি দুই ধারা যুক্ত করছে: বইগুলো ভালোভাবে মোড়ানো ছিল, এরপরও কিছু ভেজা ছিল। এই কনট্রাস্ট দেখাতে 'although' বা 'though' ব্যবহার করা যায়; এখানে 'although' দিয়েছি কারণ এটি সম্পূর্ণ বাক্যকে সাবধানে যুক্ত করে।

উপসংহার: প্রতিটি উত্তর সাধারণ ইংরেজি প্রিপোজিশন/সাবর্ডিনেটিং কনজাংকশনের নিয়ম অনুসারে বেছে নেওয়া হয়েছে যাতে বাক্যের অর্থ স্পষ্ট ও প্রাকৃতিক থাকে।
