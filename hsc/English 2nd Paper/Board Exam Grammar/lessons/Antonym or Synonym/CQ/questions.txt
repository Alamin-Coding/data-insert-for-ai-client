Our forefathers practiced a good number of social values like simplicity, honesty,  sincerity, responsibility , and piety. We have replaced those good aspects with  complexity , dishonesty, corruption, conspiracy, faithlessness and  envy . Our materialistic attitude has made us self-centered and corrupted. We must get rid of these  vices  and create awarenessamong all about the negative  impacts  of our wrong doings. In order to make a better society, we should create awareness among people about the out-come of their misdeeds. We must have distinctive social values once practiced by our forefather. We should give  importance  to the past moral values to bring peace and harmony in the society and make the world better for living.

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:
ক "Accepted"–এর বিপরীত হলো "rejected" কারণ accepted মানে গ্রহণ করা, আর rejected মানে প্রত্যাখ্যান করা; তাই এগুলো পরস্পর বিপরীত অর্থ প্রকাশ করে।  
খ "sincerity"–এর বিরোধী শব্দ হলো "insincerity" বা "dishonesty" কারণ sincerity মানে আন্তরিকতা/ভাল বিশ্বাস, আর insincerity হলো অসততা বা মিথ্যা আচরণ।

ঘ "complexity"–এর বিপরীত হলো "simplicity" কারণ complexity জটিলতা নির্দেশ করে এবং simplicity সরলতা, যা বিপরীত ধারণা।  
ঙ "envy"–এর বিরোধী শব্দ হলো "contentment" বা "satisfaction" কারণ envy হলো ঈর্ষা, আর contentment হলো সন্তুষ্টি যা ঈর্ষার বিপরীত মানসিকতা।  
চ "vices"–এর বিপরীত হলো "virtues" কারণ vices দুরাগুণ নির্দেশ করে এবং virtues সৎ গুণাবলী, তাই তারা পরস্পর বিপরীত।  
ছ "impacts"–এর সমার্থক হলো "effects" বা "consequences" কারণ impact কোনো প্রভাব বা ফলাফল নির্দেশ করে, যা effects ও consequences-এর অর্থ।  
জ "importance"–এর সমার্থক হলো "significance" কারণ উভয়ই কোনো বিষয়ের গুরুত্ব বা তাৎপর্য বোঝায়।  
ঝ "out-come"–এর সমার্থক হলো "result" বা "consequence" কারণ outcome হলো কোনো কার্যক্রমের ফলাফল, যা result দ্বারা প্রকাশ পায়।

গ. “vaccine‑preventable” শব্দের প্রতিশব্দ লিখুন (একটি শব্দ বা সংক্ষিপ্ত শব্দগুচ্ছ)
ঘ. আপনার প্রতিটি প্রতিশব্দ/বিপরীতার্থক নির্বাচন কেন উপযুক্ত—সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা দিন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক threat → safety/asset; outbreaks → containment/control; eliminate → allow/retain; strengthened → weakened

খ collective immunity → herd immunity/community immunity; immunization → vaccination; prevents → averts/halts; public trust → public confidence/community confidence

গ vaccine‑preventable → vaccine‑avoidable / preventable by vaccine (synonym: vaccine‑preventable can be rephrased as "vaccine‑avoidable diseases")

ঘ threat→safety: 'threat' denotes danger; its opposite is a state of safety. outbreaks→containment: 'outbreaks' are uncontrolled occurrences; the opposite concept is control or containment. eliminate→allow/retain: to 'eliminate' is to remove entirely; an antonym is to permit or keep. strengthened→weakened: direct antonym. collective immunity→herd immunity/community immunity: established synonyms used in public health. immunization→vaccination: exact synonym. prevents→averts/halts: common verbs with same function. public trust→public confidence: synonymous social concept. vaccine‑preventable→vaccine‑avoidable: this paraphrase clarifies that the disease can be avoided through vaccination; 'vaccine‑preventable' is a standard compound term in health communication.

Explanation:
Explanation:

ক Antonyms:
- threat — safety
- outbreaks — containment
- eliminate — allow
- strengthened — weakened

খ Synonyms:
- collective immunity — herd immunity
- immunization — vaccination
- prevents — averts
- public trust — public confidence

গ Synonym for “vaccine‑preventable”:
- preventable by vaccination

ঘ Brief explanations:
- "Threat" means danger, while "safety" denotes absence of danger, so they are opposites.  
- "Outbreaks" are uncontrolled spread of disease; "containment" means stopping that spread, making them antonyms.  
- "Eliminate" means remove or eradicate; "allow" (or "permit to continue") is its opposite in this context.  
- "Strengthened" and "weakened" are direct opposites describing increase vs decrease in strength.  
- "Collective immunity" and "herd immunity" are equivalent terms used in epidemiology.  
- "Immunization" is commonly achieved by "vaccination," so the words are used synonymously.  
- "Prevents" and "averts" both mean to stop something from happening, so they are synonyms.  
- "Public trust" and "public confidence" both describe the populace’s belief in institutions, so they match in meaning.  
- "Preventable by vaccination" restates "vaccine‑preventable" in plain phrasing, showing the same idea.

গ. “calamity” এর জন্য সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত প্রতিশব্দ হিসেবে একটি শব্দ নির্বাচন করুন (options: disaster, blessing, benefit, convenience)
ঘ. প্রতিটি উত্তর কেন বেছে নিয়েছেন — সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা দিন (প্রতিটি ১–২ বাক্যে)।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক calamity → blessing; livelihoods → comfort/well‑being; resilience → fragility/vulnerability; cooperation → conflict/division

খ hinder → impede/hamper; crop yields → harvest/produce; erode → wear away/undermine; water management → irrigation/resource management

গ Chosen word: disaster

ঘ calamity→blessing: 'calamity' means a great misfortune, so its opposite is a positive event like 'blessing'. livelihoods→comfort/well‑being: 'livelihoods' refer to means of living, opposite would be a state of security or comfort. resilience→fragility/vulnerability: 'resilience' is the ability to recover, so the antonym is lack of that ability. cooperation→conflict/division: 'cooperation' implies working together; its opposite is disagreement or division. hinder→impede/hamper: both are common synonyms meaning to obstruct. crop yields→harvest/produce: direct synonyms used in agriculture. erode→wear away/undermine: both capture the gradual damaging sense. water management→irrigation/resource management: practical synonyms in context. disaster chosen for 'calamity' because it is the closest direct synonym conveying large-scale misfortune; the other choices are positive or unrelated.

Explanation:
This item tests recognition of synonyms and antonyms within a thematic paragraph about drought and agriculture. For antonyms, choose words that directly oppose the sense (e.g., 'resilience' vs 'vulnerability'). For synonyms, prefer common single-word equivalents used in environmental and agricultural contexts (e.g., 'hinder' → 'impede'). The multiple-choice pick for 'calamity' selects 'disaster' as the closest meaning match.

Question:
On a rainy afternoon, a traveler opened a worn paperback and felt as if he were following a map to unseen places. Each chapter guided him across landscapes of memory and imagination. The book was a companion on lonely roads and a lantern in dark inns; through it he found comfort, direction, and sometimes unexpected delight.

Options:
ক. 'map' (provide a synonym in figurative sense), 'unseen' (provide an antonym), 'landscapes' (provide a synonym)
খ. 'companion' (provide a synonym), 'lonely' (provide an antonym), 'lantern' (provide a synonym)
গ. 'comfort' (provide a synonym), 'direction' (provide a synonym), 'unexpected' (provide an antonym)
ঘ. 'delight' (provide a synonym), 'worn' (provide an antonym), 'guide' (provide a synonym)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর:
- 'map' (figurative) — guide / roadmap (synonym: guide). Explanation: in a figurative sense a 'map' directs or guides understanding, so 'guide' fits.
- 'unseen' — seen / visible (antonym: visible). Explanation: 'unseen' means not seen; 'visible' is a direct opposite.
- 'landscapes' — scenes / vistas (synonym: vistas). Explanation: 'landscapes' in literary use refers to scenes or settings; 'vistas' captures that.

খ উত্তর:
- 'companion' — partner / friend (synonym: friend). Explanation: 'companion' denotes someone or something that accompanies you; 'friend' is a close match.
- 'lonely' — sociable / accompanied (antonym: accompanied). Explanation: 'lonely' implies being alone; 'accompanied' or 'company' is its antonym.
- 'lantern' — light / beacon (synonym: beacon). Explanation: 'lantern' provides illumination; metaphorically 'beacon' signals guidance.

গ উত্তর:
- 'comfort' — solace (synonym: solace). Explanation: both mean consolation or relief.
- 'direction' — guidance / orientation (synonym: guidance). Explanation: 'direction' here means instruction or a path; 'guidance' matches.
- 'unexpected' — expected / foreseeable (antonym: expected). Explanation: 'unexpected' means not anticipated; 'expected' is the opposite.

ঘ উত্তর:
- 'delight' — pleasure / joy (synonym: joy). Explanation: 'delight' denotes great pleasure; 'joy' is appropriate.
- 'worn' — new / pristine (antonym: new). Explanation: 'worn' describes something used or aged; 'new' is its opposite.
- 'guide' — lead / steer (synonym: lead). Explanation: 'guide' as a verb or noun implies leading; 'lead' is a simple synonym.

Explanation:
The passage uses travel imagery to describe reading. For figurative words like 'map' and 'lantern' I selected synonyms ('guide', 'beacon') that preserve the guiding/illuminating meaning. Antonyms are direct opposites relevant to the context ('unseen' vs 'visible', 'worn' vs 'new'). Where words have both literal and metaphorical senses (e.g., 'landscapes'), synonyms were chosen to retain the literary sense (e.g., 'vistas'). Brief explanations accompany each choice to show why it fits the passage.

Question:
In the heart of a small town there stood a cozy public library. People came in when they sought quiet, comfort, or knowledge. The creaky wooden floor and the warm lamp light made the place feel like a shelter from the busy world.

Solution:

খ উত্তর:

- 'quiet' — peaceful / serene (synonym: peaceful). Explanation: 'quiet' denotes lack of noise; 'peaceful' conveys a calm, tranquil atmosphere.

Explanation:
For each word the chosen synonyms or antonyms match the sense used in the passage. Synonyms reflect similar meaning and register (e.g., 'refuge' and 'shelter' both imply protection). Antonyms are selected as natural opposites in context (e.g., 'busy' vs 'calm'). Some words are metaphorical ('windows' meaning opportunities), so their synonyms are also metaphorical ('openings', 'portals'). When multiple reasonable synonyms or antonyms exist, I picked the most common and context-appropriate choice and noted brief reasoning for clarity.

Antonyms were selected as clear opposites in context (e.g., 'ignore' vs 'attend to'). For metaphorical terms like 'seasons' I selected synonyms that keep the figurative sense ('phases'). Short explanations are given to justify the appropriateness of each choice in the passage's context.

Question:
International art exhibitions often feature installations sponsored by multinational brands seeking cultural association. Visitors walk through galleries, examine works up close, and curators write detailed catalogues. While corporate backing increases an exhibition's reach, many organisers balance commercial partnerships with curatorial independence.

Options:

Question:
Maya runs a neighborhood bistro. Her soups are rich and savory, with layers of taste that some diners describe as mouthwatering. She uses a careful balance of spices — never overwhelming, but sometimes with a sharp kick that wakes the palate.

Question:
Honesty and integrity form the bedrock of trust in personal and professional life. A few falsehoods can damage relationships quickly, while consistent truthfulness builds respect and reliability. In places where honesty is honoured, cooperation and stable institutions follow; where deceit spreads, suspicion and breakdown of order are common.

Options:
ক. honesty (synonym)
খ. deceit (antonym)
গ. transparent (synonym)
ঘ. hypocrite (antonym)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক truthfulness / integrity / sincerity — these words express the quality of being honest and telling the truth.

খ truthfulness / honesty / candour — since 'deceit' means lying or trickery, its antonyms are words denoting openness and truth.

গ clear / open / candid — 'transparent' implies openness and lack of hidden motives; synonyms include 'open' and 'candid'.

ঘ sincere / genuine / honest person — a 'hypocrite' pretends to have beliefs or virtues that they do not hold; antonyms are people who are sincere or genuine in word and deed.

Explanation:
ক: 'Honesty' is closely matched by 'truthfulness', 'integrity' and 'sincerity' because all emphasize accuracy of speech and moral uprightness. খ: 'Deceit' is the act of lying or misleading; its opposite is 'truthfulness' or 'honesty' which involve telling the truth. গ: 'Transparent' in ethical and organisational contexts means 'open' or 'candid' — no hidden agendas. ঘ: A 'hypocrite' displays false virtue; antonyms like 'sincere' or 'genuine' describe someone whose actions match their stated beliefs. Each pairing rests on semantic opposites (for antonyms) or near-equals (for synonyms) grounded in everyday usage.

Question:
Community service has long been praised as a means to support neighbours and strengthen social bonds. In earlier times people often helped travellers and neighbours without expecting pay. Today some communities still practise selfless help while others treat every favour as a business exchange. To rebuild trust and healthy neighbourhoods we must revive the spirit of voluntary help.

Options:
ক. altruism (synonym)
খ. help (synonym)
গ. transactional (antonym)
ঘ. neighbourhood (synonym)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক selflessness / benevolence — one who values others' welfare above self-interest is showing altruism.

খ assist / aid / support — these words convey offering help or assistance to someone.

গ altruistic / selfless / non-commercial — transactional means done for payment or exchange; its antonym would describe motives not based on trade or gain.

ঘ community / locality / vicinity — these are synonyms for a neighbourhood, the people and area around one’s home.

Explanation:
ক: 'Altruism' refers to concern for the welfare of others; synonyms are 'selflessness' or 'benevolence' because they emphasize putting others first. খ: 'Help' means to give assistance; 'assist', 'aid' and 'support' are direct synonyms used in social contexts. গ: 'Transactional' describes relationships based on exchange or payment; its antonyms describe motives based on care rather than commerce, e.g., 'altruistic', 'selfless', or 'non-commercial'. ঘ: 'Neighbourhood' denotes the local community or area; 'community', 'locality' and 'vicinity' capture that meaning.

Question:
Protecting rivers, forests and wildlife is essential for future generations. When communities conserve natural resources they ensure food, clean water and a stable climate. Overuse and careless disposal create harm; restoration and careful management help heal damaged ecosystems. Conservation is both a duty and a practical necessity.

Options:
ক. conservation (synonym)
খ. exploit (antonym)
গ. restore (synonym)
ঘ. pollution (antonym)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক preservation / protection / safeguarding — 'conservation' means protecting nature from damage or loss.

খ protect / preserve / conserve — to 'exploit' is to use something for gain (often damaging it); antonyms denote safeguarding rather than using up.

গ rehabilitate / renew / replenish — 'restore' means to bring back to a former or healthy condition; these are close synonyms.

ঘ cleanliness / purity / environmental health — 'pollution' is contamination and dirtiness; antonyms emphasize cleanliness, purity or an unpolluted environment.

Explanation:
ক: 'Conservation' involves actions to 'preserve' or 'protect' ecosystems; these synonyms capture the proactive safeguarding aspect. খ: 'Exploit' implies taking advantage of natural resources, often causing harm; its antonyms ('protect', 'preserve', 'conserve') reflect the opposite approach of care and restraint. গ: 'Restore' focuses on repairing or renewing damaged systems; 'rehabilitate', 'renew' or 'replenish' are used in ecological and practical restoration work. ঘ: 'Pollution' means harmful contamination; antonyms such as 'cleanliness' or 'purity' describe an environment free from pollutants. The choices are selected to reflect common ecological vocabulary and the passage's emphasis on protective action versus damaging use.

Question:
Reports described targeted arrests of teachers, doctors, and journalists. Schools were closed, neighborhoods emptied, and many families were uprooted as intellectuals were taken in late-night raids.

Options:
ক. targeted (synonym)
খ. closed (antonym)
গ. uprooted (synonym)
ঘ. taken (antonym)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: singled out; alternative synonyms: selected, aimed at

খ Answer: opened; alternative antonyms: operational, functioning

গ Answer: displaced; alternative synonyms: uprooted (again), removed from home

ঘ Answer: released / left in place; alternative antonyms: kept, retained

Explanation:
ক (targeted → singled out / selected): 'Targeted' in this context means specific individuals or groups were chosen for action. 'Singled out' and 'selected' capture that sense of deliberate focus.

খ (closed → opened / operational): 'Closed' means not open for use. Antonyms are 'opened', 'operational', or 'functioning' — words indicating that institutions (like schools) are active.

গ (uprooted → displaced): 'Uprooted' conveys being forced to leave one's home or normal life. A direct synonym is 'displaced' (commonly used in humanitarian contexts to describe removed populations).

ঘ (taken → released / left in place / retained (as opposite depends on nuance)): 'Taken' (as in 'taken away' or 'detained') means removed or arrested. A common antonym is 'released' (if the opposite action is freeing detainees). If the intended opposite is non-removal, 'left in place' or 'kept' (in the sense of 'not taken') could be used. 'Released' is the clearest single-word antonym when referring to detention.

ঘ Answer: found / accounted for; alternative: located

Explanation:
ক (bombardment → shelling / artillery attack): 'Bombardment' refers to sustained heavy attack, often by artillery or air. 'Shelling' is a direct synonym, especially in a naval/coastal context; 'artillery attack' is a close equivalent.

খ (forced → voluntary / willing): 'Forced' implies compulsion. Antonyms are words indicating lack of compulsion, such as 'voluntary', 'willing', or 'uncoerced'.

গ (surrounded → encircled / hemmed in): 'Surrounded' means enclosed on all sides. Synonyms include 'encircled', 'ringed', or 'hemmed in'. 'Encircled' is the most precise single-word synonym.

খ Answer: rebuilt; alternative antonyms: restored, constructed

গ Answer: open road / open passage; alternative: unguarded route

ঘ Answer: the living; alternative synonym: those who survived

Explanation:
ক (refugees → evacuees / displaced persons): 'Refugees' are people forced to leave their homes because of danger. Synonyms in this context include 'evacuees' (those who have been evacuated) and 'displaced persons' (emphasizing loss of home).

খ (razed → rebuilt/restored): 'Razed' means demolished or leveled to the ground. Clear antonyms are verbs meaning to put back or construct again: 'rebuilt', 'restored', or 'constructed'.

গ (checkpoints → open road/open passage): A 'checkpoint' is a controlled, monitored barrier. An opposite concept is an uncontrolled or open route — e.g., 'open road' or 'open passage' — indicating there is no inspection or barrier. Depending on style, 'unguarded route' serves as an antonym.

ঘ (survivors → the living / those who survived): 'Survivors' are people who remain alive after a calamity. Common synonyms are 'the living' or 'those who survived'. 'Rescued' or 'recovered' might be used in specific contexts but 'the living' is a general synonym.

Question:
In a democratic republic citizens enjoy basic rights such as freedom of expression, the right to assemble, equality before the law, and access to public services. The constitution guarantees these liberties and free elections enable people to choose their leaders who are expected to promote social welfare and justice.

Options:
ক. Give two synonyms for: freedom, expression, constitution.
খ. Give two antonyms for: equality, liberty.
গ. Give two synonyms for: citizen, leader, welfare.
ঘ. Give two antonyms for: oppression, discrimination.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক freedom — liberty, independence; expression — speech, articulation; constitution — charter, fundamental law.
খ equality — inequality, discrimination; liberty — bondage, subjugation (or slavery).
গ citizen — resident, inhabitant (or national); leader — representative, head (or chief); welfare — well-being, public good (or social security).
ঘ oppression — freedom, liberty (opposite concepts); discrimination — equality, impartiality.

Explanation:
Answers are chosen based on common semantic relationships: synonyms are words that share similar meanings and can often substitute in many contexts, while antonyms are words with opposite meaning. For (ক) 'freedom' and 'liberty' are near-identical in civic contexts; 'independence' emphasizes absence of control. 'Expression' relates to 'speech' and 'articulation' as ways of conveying thought. 'Constitution' is a nation's 'charter' or 'fundamental law'. For (খ) 'equality' opposes 'inequality' and 'discrimination'—the denial of equal treatment; 'liberty' is opposed by 'bondage' or 'subjugation' (states of restricted freedom). For (গ) 'citizen' synonyms emphasize belonging (resident, national); 'leader' synonyms denote role (representative, head); 'welfare' synonyms focus on well-being and social support. For (ঘ) the antonyms given highlight the positive opposites of harmful terms: 'oppression' is countered by 'freedom'/'liberty', and 'discrimination' is countered by 'equality'/'impartiality'. These choices reflect typical usage in civics and social studies contexts.

ক. Provide two synonyms for: transparent, accountable, judiciary.
খ. Provide two antonyms for: free, fair, stable.
গ. Provide two synonyms for: ballot, representative, housing.
ঘ. Provide two antonyms for: corrupt, injustice.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক transparent — clear, open; accountable — answerable, responsible; judiciary — courts, bench.
খ free — restricted, constrained; fair — biased, unjust; stable — unstable, volatile.
গ ballot — vote, polling slip; representative — delegate, parliamentarian (or proxy); housing — shelter, accommodation.
ঘ corrupt — honest, incorruptible; injustice — justice, fairness.

Explanation:
Synonyms (ক and গ) group words with comparable meanings used in governance contexts: 'transparent' means 'open' or 'clear' (processes), 'accountable' implies being 'answerable' or 'responsible', and 'judiciary' refers to 'courts' or the 'bench'. 'Ballot' equates to a 'vote' or 'polling slip'; 'representative' can be a 'delegate' or 'parliamentarian'; 'housing' aligns with 'shelter' or 'accommodation'. Antonyms (খ and ঘ) pair each target with words that convey the opposite condition: a 'free' process contrasted with one that is 'restricted' or 'constrained'; 'fair' opposite is 'biased' or 'unjust'; 'stable' opposed by 'unstable' or 'volatile'. 'Corrupt' is opposed by 'honest' or 'incorruptible', and 'injustice' is opposed by 'justice' or 'fairness'. Selection aims for commonly accepted lexical opposites and near-synonyms appropriate to civic vocabulary.

Question:
A jeweler showed two strands to a customer: one of real pearls and one of glass beads painted to look like pearls. At first both looked equally lustrous and the customer was impressed with the cheaper strand. Later, when exposed to wear and cleaning, the imitation beads lost their sheen and some coatings flaked away, while the real pearls kept their natural glow. The jeweler explained that true value often survives use and time, while mere appearance can be temporary.

Options:
ক. Find an antonym of 'precious' as it contrasts with imitation in the passage.
খ. Find a synonym for 'lustrous' as used to describe both strands.
গ. Give a synonym for 'imitation' suitable for the context of glass beads.
ঘ. Provide an antonym of 'natural' as used to describe pearls' glow.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক worthless / valueless
খ shiny / glossy / gleaming
গ fake / counterfeit / artificial
ঘ artificial / manufactured

Explanation:
ক (antonym of 'precious'): 'Precious' means having high worth or value. In this context the opposite is 'worthless' or 'valueless' because imitation beads lack lasting monetary or intrinsic worth. 

খ (synonym of 'lustrous'): 'Lustrous' describes a surface that reflects light attractively. Suitable synonyms are 'shiny', 'glossy', or 'gleaming' — all convey visible sheen that initially made both strands appealing. 

গ (synonym of 'imitation'): 'Imitation' refers to something made to appear like something else. Appropriate synonyms here are 'fake', 'counterfeit', or 'artificial' because the glass beads are manufactured to resemble real pearls. 

ঘ (antonym of 'natural'): 'Natural' here implies authentic, originating from nature (real pearls). The opposite is 'artificial' or 'manufactured', which fits the glass beads whose glow and coating are man-made. 

Overall reasoning: Each answer matches the semantic relation required (synonym or antonym) and fits the passage context contrasting enduring, genuine value with transient appearance.

Question:
In a neighborhood, two people were praised for politeness. One consistently helped others for years without seeking credit; the other smiled, complimented people, and attended events but was later found to ask favors only when convenience arose. Neighbors realized kindness can be genuine or performative, and outward manners don't always reveal inner motives.

Options:
ক. Give a synonym for 'politeness' as used to describe both people.
খ. Choose an antonym for 'genuine' referring to the second person's kindness.
গ. Provide a synonym for 'performative' that fits the described behavior.
ঘ. Find an antonym for 'inner (motives)' to contrast outward manners.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক courtesy / civility / politeness
খ insincere / false / phony
গ showy / ostentatious / superficial
ঘ outward / external

Explanation:
ক (synonym of 'politeness'): 'Politeness' refers to courteous behaviour; 'courtesy' and 'civility' are direct synonyms emphasizing respectful social conduct shown by both neighbors. 

খ (antonym of 'genuine'): 'Genuine' means sincere and authentic. The second person's kindness was not sincere, so antonyms such as 'insincere', 'false', or 'phony' correctly capture the lack of authenticity. 

গ (synonym of 'performative'): 'Performative' implies actions done for show rather than from sincere feeling. Suitable synonyms are 'showy', 'ostentatious', or 'superficial', indicating the behavior aimed to create appearance rather than substance. 

ঘ (antonym of 'inner (motives)'): 'Inner' refers to internal motives or character. The contrasting term is 'outward' or 'external', which points to surface behaviour or appearances. 

Overall reasoning: Each answer distinguishes form (polite appearance) from substance (authentic kindness), matching the passage's lesson that behaviour can be outwardly appealing yet inwardly hollow.

Question:
Bedtime stories for young children are meant to soothe and inspire. They should be comforting rather than frightening, hopeful rather than pessimistic, and truthful rather than misleading. Stories with repetitive structure and simple moral lessons help reinforce good behaviour while keeping the child's imagination active without causing anxiety.

Options:
ক. comforting (antonym)
খ. hopeful (synonym)
গ. misleading (antonym)
ঘ. repetitive (synonym)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক distressing / frightening / unsettling
খ hopeful = optimistic / encouraging / positive
গ truthful / accurate / honest
ঘ repetitive = recurring / patterned / iterative

Explanation:
ক: 'Comforting' describes something that soothes or eases distress. Antonyms such as 'distressing', 'frightening', or 'unsettling' denote material that causes fear or discomfort—unsuitable for bedtime.

খ: 'Hopeful' conveys a sense of optimism about the future. Synonyms include 'optimistic', 'encouraging', and 'positive', all fitting for tales that inspire children.

গ: 'Misleading' indicates giving a false impression. Its antonyms—'truthful', 'accurate', or 'honest'—refer to stories that present situations or morals genuinely, supporting a child's understanding of right and wrong.

Explanation:
ক: 'Informative' describes material that conveys useful facts or knowledge. Synonyms are 'educational', 'instructive', or 'enlightening', all emphasizing useful content.

খ: 'Addictive' describes something that creates compulsive use. Antonyms refer to content that does not foster dependency: 'non-addictive', 'balanced', or 'moderate'. These terms suggest healthy, controllable engagement.

Question:
In modern classrooms teachers carefully choose reading materials that capture students' attention. The readings should be engaging without being sensational; educational without being dull; age-appropriate without being patronising. Teachers must avoid material that is biased or inflammatory, and they should favor texts that are concise and lucid so learners can stay focused and build good study habits.

Options:
ক. engaging (antonym)
খ. sensational (synonym)
গ. patronising (antonym)
ঘ. concise (antonym)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক boring / unengaging
খ sensational = sensationalistic / exaggerated
গ respectful / encouraging / egalitarian
ঘ verbose / wordy / long-winded

Explanation:
ক: 'Engaging' means holding attention or interest. The opposite is 'boring' or 'unengaging', which describes texts that fail to capture learners' attention.

খ: 'Sensational' refers to material that is designed to shock or excite, often by exaggeration. Synonyms include 'sensationalistic' or 'exaggerated'. These words emphasize dramatic or overstated presentation.

গ: 'Patronising' means treating others with an apparent kindness that betrays a feeling of superiority. Antonyms are words that convey equality and respect, such as 'respectful', 'encouraging', or 'egalitarian'. These describe tones that uplift rather than belittle.

ঘ: 'Concise' means brief and to the point. Its antonyms include 'verbose', 'wordy', or 'long-winded', which indicate excessive length or unnecessary detail that can distract learners.

Question:
A carpenter described two planks: one from old oak and another from lightweight plywood painted to look luxurious. The oak was heavy, dense, and withstood hammering and weather; the plywood scratched easily and the paint chipped after a season. He used this contrast to teach apprentices about choosing materials for long-lasting furniture versus quick decorative fixes.

Options:
ক. Pick a synonym for 'dense' as it applies to oak.
খ. Choose an antonym for 'withstood' in the context of how plywood behaved.
গ. Find a synonym for 'luxurious' used to describe the painted plywood's appearance.
ঘ. Give an antonym for 'long-lasting' relevant to the plywood.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক compact / solid / heavy
খ failed / yielded / succumbed
গ ostentatious / showy / fancy
ঘ short-lived / temporary / ephemeral

Explanation:
ক (synonym of 'dense'): 'Dense' signifies tightly packed material or substantial weight; synonyms like 'compact', 'solid', or simply 'heavy' capture the oak's physical sturdiness. 

খ (antonym of 'withstood'): 'Withstood' means resisted or endured. The plywood did not resist hammering or weather, so antonyms include 'failed', 'yielded', or 'succumbed', indicating it gave way under stress. 

গ (synonym of 'luxurious'): 'Luxurious' conveys richness or an appearance of high quality. For painted plywood trying to look expensive, 'ostentatious', 'showy', or 'fancy' are fitting synonyms emphasizing appearance over substance. 

ঘ (antonym of 'long-lasting'): 'Long-lasting' means durable over time. The plywood's short service life makes antonyms like 'short-lived', 'temporary', or 'ephemeral' appropriate. 

Overall reasoning: Answers align with material properties described — solid/dense oak vs superficially attractive but weak plywood — emphasizing contrast between substance and mere appearance.

Question:
An imaginative painter blends color and idea. Practice refines technique; without enthusiasm a canvas remains flat. Honest critique, discipline, and a patient attitude can turn simple talent into admired art.

Options:
ক. imaginative (synonym):
খ. enthusiasm (antonym):
গ. honest (synonym):
ঘ. patient (synonym):


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক creative
খ apathy
গ truthful/sincere
ঘ tolerant/enduring

Explanation:
ক (imaginative → creative): 'Imaginative' and 'creative' both describe the ability to produce original ideas or art — clear synonyms. খ (enthusiasm → apathy): 'Enthusiasm' means eager interest or excitement; its opposite is 'apathy', meaning lack of interest or indifference. গ (honest → truthful/sincere): 'Honest' can synonymously be 'truthful' (telling the truth) or 'sincere' (genuine in attitude). Either works depending on nuance in the sentence; here 'truthful' or 'sincere' captures the intended meaning. ঘ (patient → tolerant/enduring): 'Patient' implies the ability to wait calmly or endure difficulty; synonyms include 'tolerant' or 'enduring'.

Question:
A small town was shaken when a viral video spread false claims about the municipal clinic. The video created a public uproar and many citizens began to blame the clinic staff. Some residents shouted insults, while others spread rumors that tarnished reputations. The clinic manager invited a community liaison to calm the situation and provide accurate information. Gradually, facts replaced fear and harmony returned to the neighborhood.

Options:
ক. উপজীবনী বা উপরের অনুচ্ছেদ থেকে 'uproar' শব্দটির synonym লিখো।
খ. উপজীবনী থেকে 'public' শব্দটির antonym লিখো।
গ. উপজীবনী থেকে 'insult' শব্দটির synonym লিখো।
ঘ. উপজীবনী থেকে 'calm' শব্দটির antonym লিখো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক uproar — commotion / uproar = commotion / disturbance

খ public — private / public antonym is private (relating to individuals rather than the community)

গ insult — affront / insult synonym: affront / offence / disparage

ঘ calm — agitate / calm antonym: agitate / disturb / fluster

Explanation:
ক: 'Uproar' describes noisy disturbance or public agitation; common synonyms are 'commotion', 'furore', 'turmoil'. I chose 'commotion' as a close, simple synonym.

খ: 'Public' refers to the community or general population; its opposite is 'private', which refers to individual or non-public matters.

গ: 'Insult' means to speak or act in a way that offends; synonyms include 'affront', 'offend', 'disparage'. 'Affront' is a direct one-word synonym.

ঘ: 'Calm' means to make tranquil or reduce agitation; antonyms include 'agitate', 'perturb', 'disturb'. 'Agitate' fits well as the opposite action.

Question:
In a neighborhood book club, a misunderstanding about meeting dates caused tension between long-time members and newcomers. A member accidentally betrayed a confidence, which created distrust.

গ mediate — arbitrate / reconcile / intervene (synonym: reconcile / arbitrate)

গ naive — experienced / worldly / sophisticated (antonym: experienced)

Explanation:
ক: 'Skeptical' means doubtful or unconvinced; an antonym is 'convinced' or 'trusting', indicating acceptance of the idea.

খ: 'Encourage' implies giving support or confidence; synonyms include 'motivate', 'support', and 'promote'. 'Motivate' captures the teacher's role in prompting action.

Question:
The river wound quietly through the valley; its surface was placid, though under the surface the current ran deep. In flood season it could turn turbulent, but villagers relied on its abundance. Read and then produce the required antonyms or synonyms.

Question:
Assessment in modern education includes both formative checks during learning and summative tests at the end. Formative assessment offers timely feedback that teachers and students use to adjust instruction. Summative evaluation measures overall achievement. Fair assessments aim to be objective and reduce bias so that all learners get an accurate picture of their progress.

Options:
ক. "formative" (synonym)
খ. "summative" (antonym)
গ. "objective" (synonym)
ঘ. "bias" (antonym)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক diagnostic / ongoing / developmental
খ formative antonym = final / conclusive / terminal (summative contrasts with ongoing; antonyms convey end-point testing)
গ impartial / neutral / fair
ঘ fairness / impartiality / neutrality

Explanation:
ক: "Formative" assessments are meant to inform and shape learning as it happens, so synonyms include diagnostic, ongoing, and developmental — terms that emphasize feedback and improvement during instruction. 

খ: "Summative" refers to end-of-course evaluation; antonyms highlight the contrast with ongoing assessment—words like final, conclusive, or terminal indicate assessment at the end rather than during the process. 

গ: "Objective" means not influenced by personal feelings or biases; synonyms such as impartial, neutral, and fair express the goal of treating all students equally. 

ঘ: The antonym of "bias" is concepts like fairness, impartiality, or neutrality, which describe the absence of prejudice and the aim of accurate, equitable assessment.

Question:
Classrooms today blend digital tools with traditional discussion. Teachers design lessons that integrate multimedia, encourage participation, and assess understanding continuously. Technology is used to support, not replace, human interaction. Students are encouraged to be active learners who reflect on feedback and improve their skills.

Options:
ক. "integrate" (synonym)
খ. "passive" (antonym)
গ. "encourage" (synonym)
ঘ. "support" (antonym)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক combine / incorporate / blend

গ motivate / promote / stimulate
ঘ undermine / hinder / replace

Explanation:
ক: "Integrate" means to bring parts together into a whole, so synonyms include combine, incorporate, blend. These words emphasize joining resources or methods. 

খ: "Passive" describes a lack of activity or engagement; its antonyms are active, participatory, or engaged, which denote involvement and initiative—qualities the passage promotes. 

গ: "Encourage" means to give support or confidence; synonyms like motivate, promote, and stimulate capture the idea of urging students forward. 

ঘ: In the context "support, not replace," an appropriate antonym for "support" is to undermine, hinder, or replace — actions that work against helping. "Replace" directly contrasts with the passage's note that technology should not replace human interaction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
Policy makers and educators debate whether schools should 'standardize' English instruction or encourage local 'innovation'. Meanwhile, speakers routinely 'code-switch' and develop mixed repertoires. Discussions invoke words such as 'bilingual', 'standardize', 'flux', and 'essential' to make arguments about pedagogy and identity.

Options:
ক. Provide two synonyms for each of the words: 'bilingual' and 'multilingual'.
খ. Provide two antonyms for each of the words: 'standardize' and 'control'.
গ. Provide two synonyms for each of the words: 'flux' and 'innovation'.
ঘ. Provide two antonyms for each of the words: 'essential' and 'dominant'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর:
- 'bilingual' → two-language; dual-language; able to use two languages; bicultural (in some contexts).
- 'multilingual' → polyglot; many-language; plurilingual; multilingual-capable.

খ উত্তর:
- 'standardize' (antonyms) → diversify; localize; customize; decentralize.
- 'control' (antonyms) → liberate; relinquish; allow freedom; decentralize.

গ উত্তর:
- 'flux' → change; instability; flow; fluctuation.
- 'innovation' → invention; novelty; breakthrough; new development.

ঘ উত্তর:
- 'essential' (antonyms) → optional; nonessential; trivial; dispensable.
- 'dominant' (antonyms) → subordinate; minor; marginal; peripheral.

Explanation:
Synonyms for 'bilingual' and 'multilingual' emphasize the number of languages used and communicative ability; 'plurilingual' and 'polyglot' are standard scholarly or informal alternatives. Antonyms of 'standardize' focus on making things varied or tailored—'localize' and 'customize' capture that contrast—while 'control' opposed by 'liberate' or 'relinquish' fits debates about prescriptive versus permissive language policy. 'Flux' denotes continuous change, so 'instability' or 'fluctuation' are natural synonyms; 'innovation' relates to creative new forms, hence 'novelty' or 'invention'. Opposites of 'essential' and 'dominant' identify items of lesser importance or power, which is useful when arguing about curriculum priorities or linguistic prestige. Across all items the selections aim to be pragmatic for writing and argumentation in education and language policy discussions.

Type: CQ | Book: English 2nd Paper | Years:  | Boards:  | Tags: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
Linguists note that when English travels, it frequently absorbs features from local tongues: new pronunciations, loan translations, and pragmatic patterns emerge. Scholars contrast the older ideal of a single 'standard' with present-day acceptance of multiple 'varieties'. Debates often hinge on terms like 'variety', 'emerge', 'influence' and 'retain' when characterizing this dynamic process.

Options:
ক. Supply two synonyms for each of the words: 'variety' and 'emerge'.
খ. Supply two antonyms for each of the words: 'influence' and 'retain'.
গ. Give two synonyms for each of the words: 'mutual' and 'intelligibility'.
ঘ. Give two antonyms for each of the words: 'domestic' and 'global'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর:
- 'variety' → diversity; variant; form; type.
- 'emerge' → appear; arise; surface; come into being.

খ উত্তর:
- 'influence' (antonyms) → ignore; be unaffected by; resist; remain independent of.
- 'retain' (antonyms) → lose; abandon; relinquish; discard.

গ উত্তর:
- 'mutual' → reciprocal; shared; joint; common.
- 'intelligibility' → understandability; comprehensibility; clarity.

ঘ উত্তর:
- 'domestic' → foreign; international; overseas; external.
- 'global' → local; regional; domestic; parochial.

Explanation:
Synonyms were selected for clarity in sociolinguistic discourse: 'variety' is frequently used interchangeably with 'diversity' or 'variant'; 'emerge' carries connotations of slowly coming into view, so 'arise' and 'appear' are apt. Antonyms for 'influence' emphasize absence of impact (e.g., 'resist' or 'be unaffected by'), while antonyms for 'retain' focus on losing or giving up. 'Mutual' means shared between parties, so 'reciprocal' and 'joint' are close synonyms; 'intelligibility' in language contexts refers to how easily speech is understood, hence 'comprehensibility' is appropriate. 'Domestic' vs 'global' opposites reflect scale: 'domestic' contrasts with 'foreign' or 'international', and 'global' contrasts with 'local' or 'regional'. These word choices are intended to be directly usable in essays or analyses about language contact and spread.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
As international startups, online education platforms and cross-border teams multiply, English increasingly functions as the working language across cultures. This digital and professional spread has created new registers of English shaped by user needs, technology and local linguistic habits. Terms like 'prevalent', 'facilitate' and 'monolingual' often appear in articles about this change, and debates focus on whether English remains 'native' or has become a 'uniform' global tool.

Options:
ক. Write two suitable synonyms for each of the words: 'prevalent' and 'facilitate'.
খ. Give two appropriate antonyms for each of the words: 'monolingual' and 'restrict'.
গ. Provide two synonyms for each of the words: 'adopted' and 'prestige'.
ঘ. Provide two antonyms for each of the words: 'native' and 'uniform'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর:
- 'prevalent' → widespread; common; predominant; frequent.
- 'facilitate' → enable; ease; assist; promote.

খ উত্তর:
- 'monolingual' → bilingual; multilingual; polyglot (as opposites in context); linguistically-diverse.
- 'restrict' → allow; permit; enable; expand.

গ উত্তর:
- 'adopted' → embraced; taken up; accepted; implemented.
- 'prestige' → reputation; status; renown; esteem.

ঘ উত্তর:
- 'native' → nonnative; foreign; alien; second-language (user).
- 'uniform' → diverse; varied; heterogeneous; heterogeneous (non-uniform).

Explanation:
Choices prioritize common near-synonyms and clear opposites appropriate for discussions of language spread. For 'prevalent', words like 'widespread' and 'common' capture high frequency across contexts. 'Facilitate' in this context means to make easier or to enable, so 'enable' and 'ease' fit best. 'Monolingual' opposes 'bilingual'/'multilingual' because those explicitly denote use of multiple languages; 'restrict' is countered by verbs that open up possibilities, such as 'allow' or 'permit'. 'Adopted' in sociolinguistic contexts often means 'embraced' or 'implemented'; 'prestige' refers to social standing, hence 'reputation' or 'esteem'. For 'native' the straightforward opposites are 'nonnative' or 'foreign'; 'uniform' (meaning the same everywhere) is best opposed by 'diverse' or 'varied'. These recommendations focus on semantic fit rather than rare or technical synonyms so they remain usable in writing about global English.
