Question:
[math]\boxed{\rm { take\qquad pray\qquad offer\qquad remain\qquad keep\qquad do\qquad publish }}[/math]

With extreme competition everywhere parents are constantly worried about the results. This is a common sight during the S.S.C Examinations in thousands of families. Special prayers (a) ————in families having such an examinee. Parents (b) ————special care of their children. They make sure that their wards get along with studies without the slightest of problems even without mosquito bites. Parents shuttle to mazars and temples and (c)——- for the examinees.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "are offered" (from "offer") — "special prayers" is plural and the passive "are offered" fits naturally.  
(b) "take" — the correct collocation is "take special care (of)".  
(c) "pray" — people "pray for" examinees at mazars and temples.  
(d) "remain" — "remain worried" expresses a continuing state.  
(e) "is published" (from "publish") — results are usually talked about in the passive as "the result is published."

[math]\boxed{\rm { say\qquad be\qquad provide\qquad face\qquad participate\qquad enrich }}[/math]

Human life (a) ———–not static but dynamic. A man cannot reach the highest peak of success if he (b) -— in extra co-curricular activities. Travelling is also an important part of co-curricular activities. It is travelling which (e)-our knowledge, experience and promotes our attitudes. Therefore, travelling (d)—–us with knowledge and practical experience. It can be clearly (e)—that our knowledge can be mobilized by travelling the different corners of the vast globe.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Human life (a) — use "be" as "is" because the sentence needs the present linking verb: "Human life is not static but dynamic."  
For (b) use "participate" as "does not participate" to make the negative conditional: "if he does not participate in extra co‑curricular activities."  
Use "enrich" as "enriches" and "provide" as "provides" because the subject "travelling" is third‑person singular.  
Finally use "say" as "said" in the passive phrase "It can be clearly said that..."

Last Friday I went to the zoo with some of my friends. We (a) ——- there before the gate (b) ——-. Then we (c) ——- some tickets and entered the zoo. While we (d)——–, I saw my friend Raihan (e) ——-towards us.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: (a) "reached" and (b) "opened" are past simple verbs — we arrived there before the gate did its action, so "reached" (arrived) and "opened" fit. (c) "bought" is past simple for a completed action of purchasing tickets. (d) "were walking" uses past continuous to show an ongoing action, and (e) "running" (as in "I saw Raihan running towards us") describes what he was doing at that moment.

I (a)——–your letter just now. You (b)——–to know where I (c) ——— myself admitted and which subjects I (d)——–. I am now (e) -------- everything in detail.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) should be "received" because "just now" signals a completed past action.  
(b) is "want" (present desire); (c) "have got" (or "got") and (d) "have chosen" use the present perfect to show completed actions with present relevance (where I am admitted and which subjects I have chosen).  
(e) is "writing" because "am now" requires the present continuous to show the action is happening at the moment.

Question:
[math]\boxed{\rm{ adopt\qquad come\qquad rise\qquad pay\qquad do\qquad achieve\qquad try }}[/math]

Honesty is a great virtue. An honest man is liked and trusted by all. The ignorant man adopts unfair means with a view to (a) _____their objectives. In every walk of life,  honesty (b) _____most. An honest man may be poor, but he (c) _____to become rich by (d) _____dishonest means. His rise in life may be slow, but he (e) _____very high in the long run.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The ignorant man adopts unfair means with a view to achieve their objectives because "achieve" means to accomplish a goal and fits the infinitive "to". In every walk of life, honesty pays most — "pays" (third person) expresses that honesty brings rewards. An honest man may be poor, but he does not try to become rich by adopting dishonest means — an honest person won’t attempt dishonest ways, and "adopting" correctly follows "by". His rise in life may be slow, but he rises very high in the long run — "rises" shows gradual upward progress.

Most often traffic problem (a) —  in the  congested areas where the roads are very narrow. In proportion to our population roads (b) —. There are many unlicensed vehicles which should (c) — under control. The drivers are not willing to (d) — the traffic rules. Irresponsible drivers (e) — strictly.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) occurs(b) increase(c) be kept(d) obey(e) are punished

Explanation:
Most often traffic problem occurs in the congested areas where the roads are very narrow — singular subject "traffic problem" needs the verb "occurs". In proportion to our population roads increase — "roads" is plural so "increase" fits. There are many unlicensed vehicles which should be kept under control — after "should" we use passive "be kept". The drivers are not willing to obey the traffic rules — "to + base verb" takes "obey". Irresponsible drivers should be punished strictly — punishment is expressed in the passive "be punished".

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: 
- "live" fits a because it describes where people habitually reside. 
- "suffer" fits b because the verb collocates with "from" to show they experience the problem. 
- "are hampered" (be + hamper) fits c because traffic jams hinder (act upon) their office activities, so passive voice is natural. 
- "reach" fits d as the correct verb for arriving at working places. 
- "are" fits e to form "are responsible" (linking verb + adjective) describing the factors.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Correct choices: (a) can, (b) done (passive form of do), (c) diversify, (d) change, (e) eat. "Can" shows possibility; "may be done" needs the past participle "done" to form the passive. "Diversify" means broaden agricultural output, "change" naturally collocates with "habits," and "eat" completes "develop the habit of eating potatoes and wheat."

Happiness (b) refer(s) — "refer" is correct because happiness denotes or points to the contentment of the mind.  
He who (c) satisfy with what he gets and is content life (d) call a happy man — "satisfy" (meaning be satisfied) and "call" (meaning be described as) fit the sense: a person satisfied with his lot is described as a happy man.  
It is only moral and spiritual development which (e) ensure happiness — "ensure" fits because moral and spiritual growth makes happiness certain.

"Addicted" is the past-participle adjective describing people dependent on smoking; "found" is required after "has been" (perfect passive).

Explanation:
Explanation:

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: The best fits are (a) want (implied in past negative as "did not want" to show his unwillingness to sever ties), (b) lower → "was lowered" and (c) screen → "screened" because the sash/tree are acted upon (passive), and (d) see → "saw" and (e) Cast → "cast" in past tense to match the narrative.

(b) "is going" — "the present world" describes a continuing action, so present continuous fits: "is going fast."  
(c) "learning" — after "cannot help" we use a gerund, so "cannot help learning English."  
(d) "designed" — "textbooks designed for the classes XI–XII" uses the past participle to modify "textbooks."

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: In (a) "fought" is correct because the sentence describes past battles with the British and needs a past-tense verb. In (b) "regain" fits since his purpose was to get his country back, and (c) "brood" (brooding) means sitting and thinking sadly about his lot; (d) "trying" matches the spider’s repeated attempts. Finally, (e) "inspire" (inspired) is right because the spider’s perseverance motivated Bruce to fight again.

Gafur was sitting thoughtfully on the veranda. Mahesh (a) ———– anywhere since yesterday. Gafur was very weak again. So Amina (b)———– in search of him since morning. She (c)———-home at about sun-set and said, “You (d)—–— father? Manik Ghosh’s men (e)———-Mahesh to the police station.”

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Mahesh (a) "hasn't been" — "since yesterday" shows a situation continuing up to now, so present perfect is used.  
Amina (b) "has been looking" — "since morning" requires present perfect continuous to show an ongoing search.  
She (c) "returned" — coming back at sunset is a completed action, so simple past.  
In her speech (d) "Have you found father?" and (e) "Manik Ghosh’s men have sent Mahesh to the police station." — both use present perfect to report a recent result (finding/sending) relevant to the present.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct words are: (a) increased, (b) burn, (c) find, (d) predict, (e) continue. Increased fits because the amount has risen over the last century (present perfect/past sense), burn is the simple present for people’s action, find is used for scientists’ established conclusions, predict fits because they forecast the future, and continue combines with “to rise” to show the rise will keep happening.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Special prayers are "offered" because prayers are something done for someone (passive: are offered), and parents "take" special care is the correct idiom. They go to mazars and temples and "pray" for the examinees, since praying fits that action. Parents usually "remain" worried until the result "is published" because remain shows a continuing state and results are released (published) by authorities.

(c) "found" — in the passive "has not been found out yet," the past participle "found" fits.

(c) "fail" — "fail to realize" expresses that they do not notice the negative aspects (this is the only verb that matches the intended meaning). (d) "make" — here "make" (cause) is the closest option to show that pompous life causes them to go off track (better phrasing would be "gradually derails them").

Correct forms: (a) needed, (b) going, (c) learning, (d) designed, (e) modified.  
"is urgently needed" uses the past participle as an adjective after "is"; "is going fast" uses the continuous form to show ongoing change; "cannot help" must be followed by a gerund, so "learning" is correct.  
"Textbooks designed" uses the past participle to describe the books, and "have to be modified" correctly expresses the necessity in the passive voice.

[math]\boxed{\rm{ be\qquad fight\qquad regain\qquad brood\qquad try\qquad inspire\qquad help }}[/math]

Robert Bruce was the king of Scotland. Once he (a) ———- with the British forces and lost his kingdom to England. He fought several times with the British forces to (b)————his country but failed. One day, he sat in a lonely cave (c)——– over his sad lot, Suddenly he caught sight of a spider. It was (d)——-—to reach the ceiling. But each time it tried, it dropped. After six attempts it became successful. This perseverance of the spider (e)———— Bruce to fight again with the British and this time he was able to free his country from the enemy.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) fought — past simple fits because this happened in the past. (b) regain — follows "to" so the base form (infinitive) is needed. (c) brood — means to think sadly or worry; here it shows he was moping over his fate. (d) trying — the progressive form describes the spider’s repeated attempts. (e) inspired — the spider’s perseverance motivated (caused) Bruce to fight again, so past tense is used.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "came" is correct because "come to an end" is the fixed phrase meaning "finished."  
(b) "brought" fits as the past of "bring" — "had brought great misery."  
(c) "were killed and wounded" uses the passive to show people experienced those actions.  
(d) "rendered" and (e) "suffered" are the usual collocations: "rendered homeless" and "suffered from poverty, hunger and disease."

Preen,

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: 
(a) "have been" — present perfect ("have been in Savar for a whole month") shows an action/state continuing up to now. 
(b) "goes" (here goes!) — the idiom "here goes!" is used when presenting what you promised to do. 
(c) "wasn't" (wasn't used to) — the verb "be" in the past negative ("wasn't used to") shows initial unfamiliarity with the slow pace. 
(d) "am learning" — present continuous ("I am learning to take things easy") shows an ongoing process of getting used to it. 
(e) "imagine" — "You can't imagine how..." is the natural phrasing to express that something is hard to believe.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "has increased" and (b) "have burned" — use present perfect because the rise and the burning happened over the past century and still affect the present; "people" is plural so it takes "have."  
(c) "have found" — scientists use present perfect to report conclusions reached from research; (d) "predict" — this verb expresses a forecast about the future; (e) "continue" — it fits with "to rise" to show the temperature is expected to keep increasing.

"Sailed" and "carried" are simple past for completed actions in 1912; "was" links the ship to a state in the past; "had been built" is past perfect because the building occurred before that past time; and "was regarded" is passive past showing how people thought of the ship.

(a) joined (b) inspired/ inspiring (c) to raise (d) travel (e) performed (f) staged/ staging (g) is/ has been (h) feels (i) wishes (j) covers

Explanation:
Explanation: Actions that happened during the Liberation War are past events, so use past tense: (a) joined, (b) inspired, (c) raised, (e) performed and (f) staged; with "used to" the base form is used, so (d) travel. In reported speech a present becomes past, so (g) was. Present feelings and habitual wishes use present simple, so (h) feels and (i) wishes; after verbs like "wants" the following verb takes the infinitive, so the final blank is "to cover."

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) "came" — simple past for a completed action at age four. (b) "had lost" — past perfect because losing his parents happened before he came to the orphanage. (c) "was committed" — passive past (the action was done to him).  
(d) "recollect" — after modal "could" use the base verb. (e) "being" — after the preposition "in spite of" we use a gerund.  
(f) "drew" — simple past describes a past action that attracted the writer. (g) "was impressed" — passive past to show the writer’s feeling. (h) "to show" — "started" can take an infinitive (or "showing"); here "to show" expresses the beginning of that action.

(a) is arranged. (b) containing (c) lead (d) played/been played (e) runs (f) is (g) arranged (h) remains (i) scoring (j) are maintained / is maintained.

Explanation:
Use passive and participle forms to describe how matches are set up: (a) "is arranged" (passive) and (b) "containing" (present participle) explain the teams, while (g) "arranged" and (d) "played" are past participles used as adjectives. General facts take the simple present: (c) "lead", (e) "runs" and (h) "remains"; (j) "are maintained" is passive because rules are acted on. For the rest, (f) is "is" in "before it is over" (state) and (i) needs a modal + base verb "may score" (or "might score") to show a possible action.

Options:


Correct Answer: ক

Solution:
a. be forgiven; b. does not give up; c. suffers; d. will be taken; e. was; f. killing; g. called; h. brought; i.was left; j. dropped.

Explanation:
Explanation: The answers follow common grammar rules. (a) uses the modal "may" + passive base form → "be forgiven"; (d) is future passive "will be taken." (b) is negative present simple for a habitual action → "does not give up," and (c) needs third-person singular present → "suffers." Narrative events use past tense: (e) "was," (h) "brought," (j) "dropped"; (i) is past passive "was left." Finally, (f) is a non-finite gerund/participle "killing" after "committed a crime," and (g) is a past participle used adjectivally → "called."

Answer : (a) lived; (b) did not undergo; (c) got; (d) called; (e) was; (f) prescribe; (g) move; (h) got; (i) following/to follow; (j) was relieved.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) lived; (b) did not undergo; (c) got; (d) called; (e) was; (f) prescribe; (g) move; (h) got; (i) following; (j) was relieved.

Explanation: The passage is a past narrative, so main actions use the past simple (lived, got, called, was, got, was relieved). Negative past uses "did not" + base verb (did not undergo, did not prescribe). "Asked ... to" takes the base infinitive (move), and "started" is followed by the -ing form (started following).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: These sentences refer to events that happened in the past, so we use the past simple; when the subject receives the action we use the passive form. Therefore the correct forms are: "took place", "were made", "gained", "became", "broke out", "witnessed", "were destroyed", "became", "was born"; the final sentence uses present simple "hold" to describe the current state. Phrasal verbs like "broke out" and the idiom "was born" are used as shown.

They (h) — (remain) safe under the custody of their parents since birth. Parents never mind (i) — (take) pains for the upbringing of their offspring. We never (j) — (offend) our parents.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Answer :

(a) are; (b) is born; (c) know; (d) start; (e) to think/thinking; (f) nursing; (g) bringing; (h) remain; (i) taking; (j) should offend.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) are; (b) is born; (c) know; (d) start; (e) to think; (f) nursing; (g) bringing up; (h) have remained; (i) taking; (j) offend.  
Explanation: "Parents" takes plural verb "are"; a child is "born" (passive); "joys" is plural so "know" (present simple); "start" is followed by an infinitive ("to think"); after the preposition "of" we use a gerund ("nursing", "bringing up"); "since birth" requires present perfect ("have remained"); "never mind" is followed by a gerund ("taking"); habitual negatives use simple present ("offend").

Question:
One night the entire village was sleeping. The boy Bayazid Bustami was busy in study. His mother (a) — (sleep). Suddenly she woke up and (b) — (feel) thirsty. (c) — (call) her son, she told her son to give her a glass of water and (d) — (fall) asleep again. When Bayazid went to the pitcher, he (e) — (find) it empty. So, he went out with the pitcher in search of water. After a while, he (f) — (come) back home with water and found his mother (g) — (sleep). Then he waited (h) — (stand) by her bed with a glass of water. He did not make any sound lest she (i) — (wake) up. Suddenly his mother woke up and saw him with the glass of water. At once she (j) — (understand) what was the matter.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) was sleeping

(b) felt

(c) Calling

(d) fell

(e) found

(f) came

(g) sleeping

(h) standing

(i) should wake

(j) understood

Explanation:
Explanation: Use past continuous for background/ongoing actions and simple past for completed events. So (a) "was sleeping" and (g) "sleeping" show ongoing states; (b) "felt", (c) "called", (d) "fell", (e) "found", (f) "came" and (j) "understood" are simple past because they are finished actions in sequence. Use the present participle "standing" for (h) to show he waited in that position, and after "lest" use the base form "wake" (or subjunctive "should wake") for (i) to express prevention.

Question:
There are many people who (a) — (not take) physical exercise. They can hardly (b) — (realize) that they themselves (c) — (ruin) their health. They (d) — (fall) victim to many diseases. Le (e) — (become) dull to them. They (f) — (remain) always ill tempered. We (g) — (build) good health and sound mind through physical exercise. Physical exercise (h) — (make) our body active and the muscles strong. It also (i) — (improve) our power of digestion and blood circulation. It (j) — (give) strength to our brain.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a. do not take;

b. realize;

c. are ruining;

d. are falling;

e. becomes;

f. remain;

g. can build;

h. makes;

i. improves;

j. gives.

Explanation:
Use simple present for habits: (a) "do not take" because people habitually don’t exercise; after the modal "can" the base form is used so (b) "realize"; an ongoing harmful action is expressed with present continuous so (c) "are ruining". Subject–verb agreement rules give (e) "becomes" because "life" is singular, and third-person singular verbs take -s so (h),(i),(j) are "makes, improves, gives"; plural subjects use the base form so (d),(f),(g) are "fall, remain, build".

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Answers: (a) "are" (from "be"), (b) "provide", (c) "turning", (d) "cut", (e) "stopped". Explanation: Use [math]are[/math] because "trees" is plural; "provide ... with" is the correct verb + preposition pattern; after "prevent ... from" the verb takes a gerund, so "turning"; "cut" is simple present for a habitual action; and "It is high time" requires a past/subjunctive form, hence "stopped".

Once I (a) — a full moonlit night. I came out of my reading room and sat on the lawn. To  me nature (b) — in her magic beauty. Her objects (c) — to flash with heavenly radiance. I found a kind of harmony between the world and the heaven. People (d) — in the yard and (e) — themselves gossiping.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: 

(a) "experienced" — simple past fits because the narrator is relating an event he underwent.  
(b) "appeared" — "To me nature appeared in her magic beauty" is natural usage with "to me."  
(c) "seemed" (with "to flash") — "seemed to flash" correctly uses "seem" + to-infinitive to describe how the objects looked.  
(d) "were sitting" and (e) "enjoying" — past continuous ("were sitting") shows people were in the yard doing something, and the present participle "enjoying themselves" expresses the simultaneous action of gossiping.

Everyone (a) — success in life but very few can (b) — it. One of the main reasons for this failure is that many people (c) — take risks. We must remember that life (d) — not a bed of roses. It is full of troubles and problems. We (e) — face them with courage.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Answers: (a) desire, (b) attain, (c) dare, (d) may, (e) should.

“Desire” means want and “attain” means achieve, so the first two fit naturally. “Dare” is used in the sense “dare not” (they are unwilling to take risks), “may” expresses that life possibly is not a bed of roses, and “should” indicates the obligation to face problems with courage.

Once upon a time there (a) — a king who was very fond of knowing his future from the astrologers. A famous astrologer happened to (b) — at his capital on his way to Benares. The king (c) — on him to know about his future and the astrologer (d) — him something unpleasant. At this the king got furious and (e) — him to death.

Options:

Solution:


Explanation:
Answers: (a) be → "was", (b) call → "happened to call", (c) call → "called on him", (d) tell → "told", (e) condemn → "condemned (him) to death".

Explanation: The passage is narrated in the past, so all verbs take past forms (was, happened, called, told, condemned). "Happened to call" = visited by chance, "called on" fits meaning "visited/asked," and "condemned to death" is the correct collocation for sentencing.

Students (a) _____to be precise and accurate while (b) _____the questions in the examination. But the real scenario is different. Most of the students (c) —— their examination paper fairly as they cannot understand the questions properly. As a result, they (d) _____a very sorry figure in the examination.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Filled: (a) are expected, (b) answering, (c) write, (d) cut, (e) secure.  
"Are expected" shows what is required of students; "answering" is the correct gerund after "while" to describe the action; "write" fits as the verb for doing the paper. "Cut a very sorry figure" is an idiom meaning perform poorly, and "secure" means obtain good marks, so these choices make the sentence natural and meaningful.

Question:
Complete the sentences below using the words: {aspire, persevere, face, must}. Fill each blank with the word that best fits the meaning and grammar of the sentence.

Options:
ক. Many young people (_____) to become leaders and innovators.
খ. When obstacles appear, one should (_____) them with calm and courage.
গ. If you truly want to reach your goals, you need to (_____) despite setbacks.
ঘ. To achieve lasting results, discipline and effort (_____) be maintained.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: aspire

খ উত্তর: face

গ উত্তর: persevere

ঘ উত্তর: must

Explanation:
ক — 'Many young people (_____) to become leaders and innovators.' Here the plural subject 'Many young people' takes the base verb form 'aspire' (they aspire). 'Aspire' means to long for or aim at a goal, so it correctly expresses desire to become leaders.

খ — 'When obstacles appear, one should (_____) them with calm and courage.' The verb that fits semantically and grammatically is 'face' (one should face obstacles). 'Face' means confront or deal with; it pairs naturally with 'obstacles'.

গ — 'If you truly want to reach your goals, you need to (_____) despite setbacks.' The meaning requires persistence: 'persevere' (to continue despite difficulties). Grammatically 'need to persevere' is correct.

ঘ — 'To achieve lasting results, discipline and effort (_____) be maintained.' The modal 'must' completes the idea: 'must be maintained' indicates necessity. Grammatically and semantically 'must' is appropriate here.

গ. When selecting a long-term profession, one (_____) consider personal interests and strengths.
ঘ. After weighing pros and cons, you ultimately have to (_____) the path that aligns with your goals.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: explore

খ উত্তর: regret

গ উত্তর: should

ঘ উত্তর: choose

Explanation:
ক — 'Before deciding on a major, students (_____) various options.' The verb 'explore' fits: students should explore different options before deciding.

খ — 'If one follows fads without thought, one may later (_____) that choice.' The best fit is 'regret' (to feel sorry about a past action); it conveys the possible negative outcome of an unconsidered decision.

গ — 'When selecting a long-term profession, one (_____) consider personal interests and strengths.' Grammatically and logically 'should' completes the sentence: 'one should consider...'. It gives a recommendation.

ঘ — 'After weighing pros and cons, you ultimately have to (_____) the path that aligns with your goals.' The verb 'choose' expresses making a final selection and matches the context of weighing options and deciding.

খ. If we do not (_____), we will never discover our true potential.
গ. To grow professionally, you must continually (_____) your skills.
ঘ. Successful people accept that sometimes you have to (_____) before you succeed.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: learn

খ উত্তর: try

গ উত্তর: improve

ঘ উত্তর: fail

Explanation:
ক — 'Every mistake gives us a chance to (_____) if we reflect honestly.' 'Learn' fits because mistakes are opportunities for learning.

খ — 'If we do not (_____), we will never discover our true potential.' The verb 'try' completes the idea: without trying (making attempts), we cannot find out what we can do.

গ — 'To grow professionally, you must continually (_____) your skills.' 'Improve' is the correct semantic fit: to grow you must improve your skills.

ঘ — 'Successful people accept that sometimes you have to (_____) before you succeed.' The noun/verb 'fail' fits naturally: failure is often a step on the path to success and the sentence emphasizes acceptance of occasional failure.

Question:
Choose the correct verb forms to complete the short note. Verbs you may use: receive, want, plan, prefer, explain, tell.

I (a)——– your postcard a moment ago. You (b)——– to know if I (c) ——— to visit in July and which week I (d)——–. I'll write everything in detail soon.

Options:
ক. I (a)——– your postcard a moment ago.
খ. You (b)——– to know if I (c) ——— to visit in July
গ. (c) I (c) ——— to visit in July.
ঘ. (d) which week I (d)——–.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক have just received
খ wanted
গ plan
ঘ prefer

Explanation:
ক: "have just received" is the present perfect; it indicates the postcard arrived a very short time ago and connects that recent event to the present. Using simple past ("received") would be possible, but "have just received" is more natural when emphasizing the immediacy.

খ: "wanted" is past simple because the note (or postcard) was written earlier and in that earlier writing the writer expressed a desire to know something; so we report that past desire with past tense.

গ: "plan" is used here (infinitive/verb form after "to know if I...") to show the speaker's current intention. Because the friend's question was about the speaker's plan, the neutral answer is "plan." One could also use "am planning" to emphasize continuity: "am planning to visit."

ঘ: "prefer" (present simple) expresses the speaker's current choice among options (which week they would rather come). Using "would prefer" is also correct and a little more polite/formal: "which week I would prefer." The simple "prefer" is acceptable in this informal note.

I (a)——– your message this morning. You (b)——– whether I (c) ——— the offer and when I (d)——– work if I accepted. I'll answer each point below.

Options:
ক. I (a)——– your message this morning.
খ. You (b)——– whether I (c) ——— the offer
গ. (c) I (c) ——— the offer.
ঘ. (d) when I (d)——– work if I accepted.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক received
খ asked
গ would accept
ঘ would start

Explanation:
ক: "received" (simple past) is natural here: the colleague's message arrived earlier today.

খ: "asked" is past simple because the colleague had inquired in that earlier message; we report that inquiry in the past.

গ: "would accept" is used to express a conditional or tentative decision expressed in response to the colleague's question (i.e., if the offer is acceptable or if circumstances allow). It indicates willingness but not an unconditional present fact. Alternatively, "have accepted" would mean the acceptance is already completed.

ঘ: "would start" follows the conditional sense tied to acceptance: if I accepted, I would start work at a certain time. Using the conditional "would" matches the hypothetical nature of the question.

Note: Depending on context different forms are possible (e.g., "I have received", "I have accepted", "I will start"). The chosen answers keep a consistent, hypothetically conditional tone matching the query.

Options:

খ. You (b)——– to know whether I (c) ——— to keep it
গ. (c) I (c) ——— to keep it.
ঘ. (d) or (d)——– it back.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক have just got
খ asked
গ have decided
ঘ return

Explanation:
ক: "have just got" (present perfect with 'just') emphasizes the parcel arrived a very short time ago; "got" is a common informal alternative to "received."

খ: "asked" is past simple because the sender's earlier message asked about the recipient's intentions; we report that past question.

গ: "have decided" uses present perfect to indicate that the decision has been made recently and is relevant now. It connects the recent action (deciding) to the present moment.

ঘ: "return" is the base form used to state the alternative action — in the sentence fragment "to keep it or return it back," "return" pairs with "to keep" (infinitive). Note: stylistically "return it" is preferable to "return it back" because "return" already implies 'back.' For a conditional future: "will return it" could be used if the action were planned for the future.

খ. This habit (b) ———– a heavy toll on families and public health every year.
গ. An effective medical cure for many alcohol-related liver diseases has not (c) ———– yet.
ঘ. Regular drinking (d) ———– both the liver and a person's judgement.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক addicted

খ takes

গ been developed

ঘ damages

Explanation:
ক (addicted): The adjective 'addicted' is used with 'to' to describe people who have become dependent on a substance. 'People addicted to alcohol' is the natural phrase.

খ (takes): The idiom 'take a heavy toll' means to cause serious harm or deaths. 'This habit takes a heavy toll on families and public health' is the correct collocation.

গ (been developed): The passive perfect 'has not been developed yet' correctly expresses that researchers have not yet produced an effective medical cure. 'Developed' fits the passive structure 'has not been ___ yet.'

ঘ (damages): 'Damage' (or 'impair') is a transitive verb that can take two coordinated objects: 'both the liver and a person's judgement.' 'Damages' clearly expresses physical and cognitive harm caused by regular drinking.

গ. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive remedy for long-term air-quality problems has not (c) ———– yet.
ঘ. Fine particulate matter in smog (d) ———– the lungs and eyes, causing irritation and infection.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক exposed

খ claims

গ been found

ঘ irritates

Explanation:
ক (exposed): 'Exposed to' describes people who are subject to an environmental hazard. 'City residents exposed to smog' is grammatical and idiomatic.

খ (claims): Using 'claims' personifies pollution as causing deaths—'polluted air claims millions of lives' is a common journalistic expression meaning it causes or leads to death.

গ (been found): The passive perfect 'has not been found yet' conveys that a complete remedy has not yet been discovered. 'Found' suits the idea of discovering a comprehensive solution.

ঘ (irritates): 'Irritate' naturally applies to both 'lungs and eyes' and correctly describes the inflammatory effect of fine particles. It fits the plural subject and plural objects in the sentence.

ঘ. Excessive intake of sugar and saturated fat (d) ———– energy spikes and mood swings.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক dependent

খ contributes

গ been devised

ঘ triggers

Explanation:
ক (dependent): 'Dependent on' is an adjective phrase meaning that children rely on or habitually consume sugary snacks. 'Dependent' matches the pattern used in similar constructions (e.g., 'addicted to').

খ (contributes): 'Contributes to' indicates causal influence; a poor diet 'contributes to increased rates' of chronic diseases—this is the appropriate collocation.

গ (been devised): 'Has not yet been devised' (passive perfect) correctly states that no single, immediate cure has been created. 'Devised' emphasizes the development or invention of a remedy or program.

ঘ (triggers): 'Trigger' is commonly used for causes that set off episodes such as 'energy spikes and mood swings.' It fits the context of dietary effects on physiological and psychological responses.

ঘ advised

Explanation:
ক: 'noticed' — শিক্ষক ব্যানচে থাকা ডায়েরিটি লক্ষ করেছেন; 'noticed' (past) সঠিক।

খ: 'had been left' — এখানে ক্রিয়াটি ঘটেছিল তার আগে, অর্থাৎ pupil ডায়েরি বেঞ্চে রেখে গিয়েছিল; ফলে past perfect passive ('had been left') কার্যকর।

গ: 'picked' — শিক্ষক ডায়েরিটি তুলে নেন; সরাসরি অতীত 'picked' ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে ('picked it up')।

ঘ: 'advised' — শিক্ষক ছাত্রকে সতর্ক হওয়ার পরামর্শ দেন; অতীত 'advised' উপযুক্ত।

সম্পূর্ণ বাক্য (উত্তর সহ): "An old teacher noticed a worn-out notebook which had been left on the classroom bench by a forgetful pupil. He picked it up, read a page, and then advised the pupil to be more careful."

Question:
Words in the box: {ensures, achieve, derives, appreciate, satisfy, acquire}

Good preparation (a) —— success. Success is not merely the result of luck; it (b) —— from disciplined effort and clear goals. One who can (c) —— realistic aims and (d) —— the small gains along the way will progress steadily toward a larger goal.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (a) with the most suitable word from the box.
খ. Fill the blank (b) with the most suitable word from the box.
গ. Fill the blank (c) with the most suitable word from the box.
ঘ. Fill the blank (d) with the most suitable word from the box.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: ensures
খ উত্তর: derives
গ উত্তর: achieve
ঘ উত্তর: appreciate

Explanation:
ক: 'Good preparation ensures success.' Here 'ensures' is correct because it means 'makes certain' and fits the subject–verb agreement (preparation → ensures).

খ: 'it derives from disciplined effort...' The verb 'derives' correctly expresses origin; success is said to 'derive from' effort and goals.

গ: 'One who can achieve realistic aims...' 'Achieve' fits because it means to accomplish aims; the sentence speaks about accomplishing realistic aims (infinitive form 'achieve' follows 'can').

ঘ: 'and appreciate the small gains...' 'Appreciate' is appropriate here: noticing and valuing small gains helps maintain motivation. 'Satisfy' or 'acquire' would not convey the intended meaning of valuing progress.

Overall reasoning: Choose verbs that match both meaning and grammar (verb forms and collocations). 'Ensures' matches singular subject, 'derives from' is a common collocation for origin, 'can achieve' requires base verb, and 'appreciate' best captures valuing small gains.

Question:
Words in the box: {cultivates, learn, increases, results, acquire, reflect}

True knowledge (a) —— wisdom only when it is lived; mere facts do not make one wise. Understanding comes not only from what we (b) —— in books but also from experience and introspection. A habit of study that (c) —— the mind and patience (d) —— in better judgement and deeper insight.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (a) with the most suitable word from the box.
খ. Fill the blank (b) with the most suitable word from the box.
গ. Fill the blank (c) with the most suitable word from the box.
ঘ. Fill the blank (d) with the most suitable word from the box.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: results
খ উত্তর: acquire
গ উত্তর: cultivates
ঘ উত্তর: increases

Explanation:
ক: 'True knowledge results in wisdom...' The phrase 'results in' indicates that one thing leads to another; here knowledge leading to wisdom is appropriately expressed with 'results'.

খ: 'what we acquire in books' — 'acquire' is the correct verb for obtaining knowledge from books; 'learn' could also work but 'acquire' emphasizes gaining information or skills.

গ: 'A habit of study that cultivates the mind...' 'Cultivates' means to develop or foster; it fits perfectly with 'habit of study' which nurtures mental faculties.

ঘ: 'patience increases in better judgement...' Here 'increases' indicates growth over time; combined with 'results' in the earlier clause it completes the causal chain: study cultivates the mind and patience, which increases (or leads to) better judgement and deeper insight.

Overall reasoning: Select words that preserve logical cause-effect relationships and fit common collocations (e.g., 'results in', 'acquire in books', 'cultivates the mind'). Verb forms were chosen to agree with subjects and maintain fluency.

Question:
Words in the box: {promotes, maintain, alleviates, demands, balance, consumes}

A healthy lifestyle (a) —— well-being. Regular sleep, moderate exercise and proper nutrition (b) —— a conscious effort; they do not happen by chance. Exercise (c) —— stress and fatigue, while too many unhealthy habits (d) —— energy and harm long-term health.

Options:

খ. Fill the blank (b) with the most suitable word from the box.
গ. Fill the blank (c) with the most suitable word from the box.
ঘ. Fill the blank (d) with the most suitable word from the box.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: promotes
খ উত্তর: demand (use 'demand' → but from box 'maintain' or 'demands' available; grammatically 'demand' should be 'demand' or 'requires')
গ উত্তর: alleviates
ঘ উত্তর: consumes

Explanation:
ক: 'A healthy lifestyle promotes well-being.' 'Promotes' is correct because it means 'encourages' or 'supports' well-being.

খ: 'Regular sleep... nutrition demand a conscious effort' — the proper verb is 'demand' or 'demands' depending on whether the subject is treated collectively. In the box we have 'demands' (plural/singular form as needed). Using 'demands' (or 'require(s)') expresses that healthy habits need deliberate action.

গ: 'Exercise alleviates stress and fatigue' — 'alleviates' means 'reduces', which is the intended meaning; exercise reduces stress and tiredness.

ঘ: 'while too many unhealthy habits consume energy and harm long-term health.' 'Consumes' fits because unhealthy habits 'use up' or drain physical and mental energy.

Overall reasoning: Chosen words fit common verb–noun collocations (e.g., 'promotes well-being', 'alleviates stress'). Ensure verb agreement and intended meaning: habits demand effort, exercise reduces stress, unhealthy habits consume energy.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

খ have wasted

গ train seriously

ঘ will lose out

Explanation:
ক: "It's high time you..." বাক্যাংশের পর প্রচলিত ইংরেজি রীতি অনুযায়ী past simple (subjunctive sense) ব্যবহার করা হয়; তাই 'prepared' সঠিক।

খ: মোট পরিস্থিতি অতীত থেকে এখন পর্যন্ত চলমান সময়ে সময় নষ্ট হওয়ার কথা বোঝাচ্ছে, তাই present perfect 'have wasted' উপযুক্ত (এটি পূর্বে এবং এখনও পর্যন্ত হওয়ার ক্রিয়াকে নির্দেশ করে)।

গ: 'expect you to + base verb' কাঠামো সাধারণ; কোচ ও পরিবার চাইবে আপনি কঠোরভাবে অনুশীলন করুন — 'train seriously'।

ঘ: ভবিষ্যতে যদি আপনি এখনই পরিবর্তন না আনেন, ফলাফল নেতিবাচক হবে; এখানকার সহজ ভবিষ্যৎ 'will lose out' (অবসর বা সুযোগ হারানো) ব্যবহার করা যুক্তিযুক্ত।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক revised

খ have spent

গ win

ঘ will miss the opportunity

Explanation:
ক: "It's high time you..." পরিকাঠামোতে past-simple বা past-subjunctive লাগে; এখানে 'revise' (পুনরাবৃত্তি করা) এর past form 'revised' সঠিক, অর্থাৎ এখনই আপনার পড়াশোনার পরিকল্পনা সংশোধন করা জরুরি।

খ: অতীত থেকে এখন পর্যন্ত কত সময় নষ্ট হয়েছে বোঝাতে present perfect 'have spent' ব্যবহার করা উপযুক্ত (‘‘have spent too many evenings playing video games'')।

গ: 'expect you to + base verb' কাঠামোতে সরাসরি ভিত্তির ক্রিয়া চলে; পরিবারের আশা হলো আপনি 'win the scholarship' — তাই 'win' ঠিক।

ঘ: ভবিষ্যতে যদি অবহেলা চলে, আপনি সুযোগ হারাবেন — 'will miss the opportunity' অ্যাকাডেমিক প্রসঙ্গে সঠিক ও স্বচ্ছ ব্যাখ্যা।

Solution:

খ have been wasting

গ produce

ঘ will miss the promotion

Explanation:
ক: again, "It's high time you..." পরবর্তী ক্রিয়ায় past-simple ব্যবহার হয়; কাজের উপযোগী 'focus' এর past/simple form 'focused' বা ব্রিটিশ ইংরেজিতে 'focus' কে 'focused' বলা যায় — তাই 'focused' (বা 'focusеd') দেওয়া হয়েছে।

খ: সাম্প্রতিক সময় ধরে আপনি সময় নষ্ট করছেন—এই ধারাবাহিক ক্রিয়া বোঝাতে present perfect continuous বা present perfect 'have been wasting' মানানসই।

গ: 'depends on you + to/ing' ধারায় এখানে 'produce tangible results' (প্রচলিত: 'produce results') ব্যবহার করা যায়; প্রতিষ্ঠান চাইবে আপনি স্পষ্ট ফলাফল 'produce' করেন।

ঘ: ফলস্বরূপ, যদি আপনি পরিবর্তন না করেন, আপনি পদোন্নতি হারাবেন — 'will miss the promotion' ভবিষ্যৎ ফলটি পরিষ্কারভাবে নির্দেশ করে।

Question:
In many school histories, the loudest pages describe battles and crowns; the people who (a) — (lead) armies are written about at length, while the individuals who quietly (b) — (invent) the tools and methods that improve daily life are seldom (c) — (recognize). Often we (d) — (record) the deeds of conquerors but not the steady labors of makers and thinkers.

Options:
ক. (a) — (lead)
খ. (b) — (invent)
গ. (c) — (recognize)
ঘ. (d) — (record)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক lead
খ invent
গ recognized
ঘ record

Explanation:
ক — lead: The sentence is a general statement about what appears in histories. For general truths or habitual actions we use the present simple: "those who lead armies".

খ — invent: Similarly this relative clause describes a habitual or typical action: "who invent the tools" uses present simple.

গ — recognized: The phrase "are seldom (c) — (recognize)" requires a past participle to form the passive voice after the auxiliary 'are': "are seldom recognized." In the passage the auxiliary 'are' is present, so the blank is filled with the past participle "recognized." Using passive emphasizes that these people do not receive acknowledgment.

ঘ — record: "We (d) — (record) the deeds of conquerors" is another general statement; with the adverb "often" omitted earlier, present simple "record" is correct: "We record the deeds of conquerors." If the sentence had an auxiliary or a passive structure, a different form might be needed, but here simple present fits the habitual sense.

Question:
When cities raise monuments, they (a) — (put) statues of kings and generals on high plinths, yet the craftsmen who (b) — (carve) those statues often remain unnamed. Their hands and techniques (c) — (preserve) local traditions across generations, but their own names are frequently (d) — (forget).

Options:
ক. (a) — (put)
খ. (b) — (carve)
গ. (c) — (preserve)
ঘ. (d) — (forget)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক put
খ carve
গ preserve
ঘ forgotten

Explanation:
ক — put: The clause "they (a) — (put) statues" states a habitual action by cities when they erect monuments, so the present simple "put" is correct.

খ — carve: "the craftsmen who (b) — (carve) those statues" describes the typical action of craftsmen; present simple "carve" fits a relative clause describing recurring or characteristic behavior.

গ — preserve: "Their hands and techniques (c) — (preserve) local traditions" speaks of an ongoing effect; present simple "preserve" indicates that this is a general, continuous truth.

ঘ — forgotten: The sentence contains the auxiliary phrase "are frequently (d) — (forget)." To complete the passive construction, the past participle "forgotten" is required: "are frequently forgotten." This emphasizes that their names are left out of historical memory.

Question:

Options:
ক. (a) — (praise)
খ. (b) — (develop)
গ. (c) — (improve)
ঘ. (d) — (praise)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক praise
খ develop
গ improve
ঘ praised

Explanation:
ক — praise: "Many chronicles (a) — (praise) the rulers" states a general tendency of historical records; present simple "praise" is used for habitual or typical actions.

খ — develop: The phrase "those who (b) — (develop) irrigation..." describes people who characteristically invent or build systems; present simple "develop" is appropriate for that ongoing/general sense.

গ — improve: "simple machines that (c) — (improve) health and productivity" expresses a general truth about the effect of those inventions; present simple "improve" is correct.

ঘ — praised: The clause "their contributions are sometimes (d) — (praise) only much later" requires the past participle to form the passive: "are sometimes praised." The passive highlights that recognition often comes to these contributors belatedly.

Rafiq sat nervously by the roadside. Karim (a) ——— to the market in the morning. When he did not come back, Rafiq (b) ——— the neighbours for help. They (c) ——— a young man from next door who (d) ——— Karim's wallet under the bench.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: had gone
খ উত্তর: called
গ উত্তর: fetched
ঘ উত্তর: found

Explanation:
ক (had gone): The sentence describes an action completed earlier than the moment of waiting, so the past perfect 'had gone' is appropriate: 'Karim had gone to the market in the morning.'

খ (called): To ask for assistance after Karim failed to return, Rafiq phoned or summoned neighbours, so 'called' fits: 'Rafiq called the neighbours for help.'

গ (fetched): The neighbours would go and bring someone over; 'fetched' means they brought the young man from next door to assist: 'They fetched a young man from next door.'

ঘ (found): The young man located the wallet under the bench, so 'found' completes the idea: 'who found Karim's wallet under the bench.'

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: has stayed
খ উত্তর: called
গ উত্তর: brought
ঘ উত্তর: felt

Explanation:
ক (has stayed): The action extends from early morning up to now, so present perfect 'has stayed' correctly expresses that Dr. Selim remained at the clinic.

খ (called): To alert emergency services when the patient collapsed, Nurse Amina 'called' the ambulance — simple past fits the narrative sequence.

গ (brought): The attendants moved the stretcher into the emergency room; 'brought' (past tense) indicates they transported it there quickly.

ঘ (felt): After receiving treatment, the patient experienced improvement; 'felt' expresses the patient's state change: 'felt much better.'

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

খ উত্তর: searched
গ উত্তর: looked
ঘ উত্তর: returned

Explanation:
ক (handed): At the end of an exam students 'handed' their answer sheets to the invigilator — past tense fits the completed action.

খ (searched): Realizing a page was missing, Rima 'searched' through her bag to find it; 'searched' implies a deliberate rummage.

গ (looked): She also 'looked' under the desk; 'looked' is natural for scanning a nearby area for the sheet.

ঘ (returned): Once the sheet was recovered, the invigilator 'returned' it to the head of department — 'returned' indicates giving it back to the appropriate authority.

All selected words are taken from the boxed list and agree with the narrative sequence and tenses.

Question:
Word bank: criticize, fail, introspect, blame

People often (a) ——– others for their faults, yet they (b) ——– to see their own mistakes. True improvement comes when someone is willing to (c) ——– honestly and (d) ——– others less readily.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক criticize খ fail গ introspect ঘ blame

Explanation:
ক (criticize): The sentence "People often (a) ——– others for their faults" requires a verb that means pointing out or finding fault with others — "criticize" fits naturally.

খ (fail): The clause "yet they (b) ——– to see their own mistakes" needs a verb phrase meaning 'do not manage to' or 'are unable to', so "fail" (i.e., "fail to see") completes the idea.

গ (introspect): "True improvement comes when someone is willing to (c) ——– honestly" calls for a verb meaning self-examination; "introspect" (to look inward) is the correct choice.

ঘ (blame): The final phrase "and (d) ——– others less readily" contrasts with introspection: instead of placing responsibility outward, one should blame others less. "Blame" is the appropriate verb here. Grammatically each chosen word fits the sentence structure and preserves the intended contrast between criticizing others and self-examination.

Options:

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক procrastinate খ prioritize গ overcome ঘ persist

Explanation:
ক (procrastinate): "Putting important tasks off" directly describes procrastination, so "procrastinate" fills blank (a).

খ (prioritize): The sentence says they "seldom (b) ——– their duties effectively" — to manage duties well one must set priorities, so "prioritize" is the correct verb.

গ (overcome): "To accomplish goals one must (c) ——– challenges" requires a verb meaning to get past obstacles; "overcome" fits perfectly.

ঘ (persist): The final idea stresses steady effort over time; "persist" (to continue resolutely) conveys that meaning. Each selection aligns semantically with the actions described and the cause–effect flow of the paragraph.

Options:

খ. Fill blank (b)

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক appreciate খ boast গ acknowledge ঘ credit

Explanation:
ক (appreciate): The phrase "When people (a) ——– the support they received" expects a verb meaning to be grateful for or value help — "appreciate" is correct.

খ (boast): Being appreciative makes one "less likely to (b) ——– about accomplishments". "Boast" (to speak with excessive pride) contrasts with humility.

গ (acknowledge): "A mature character will (c) ——– help when it's due" requires a verb meaning to recognize or admit receiving assistance; "acknowledge" fits well.

ঘ (credit): "(d) ——– collaborators for shared success" needs a verb meaning to attribute or give recognition; "credit" is the appropriate choice. Together these words produce a coherent message about gratitude, humility, and fair recognition.

Question:
In the weeks leading up to major school board examinations, tension rises in many households. Small rituals and careful routines become part of daily life. Special prayers (a) ———— in living rooms and courtyards. Parents (b) ———— closer watch over sleep, diet and study hours. Many families (c) ———— to nearby shrines or temples to seek blessings for their children. Even after the exams are over, family members (d) ———— until the official results are released.

Options:
ক. ফাঁকা (a) পূরণ কর: কোন ক্রিয়া সবচেয়ে যুক্তিসঙ্গত?
খ. ফাঁকা (b) পূরণ কর: প্রাসঙ্গিক ক্রিয়া নির্বাচন কর
গ. ফাঁকা (c) পূরণ কর: কোন ক্রিয়াটি উপযুক্ত হবে?
ঘ. ফাঁকা (d) পূরণ কর: বাক্যটি সম্পূর্ণ করো


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক are offered
খ take
গ visit
ঘ remain anxious

Explanation:
ক (are offered): The sentence describes 'Special prayers' as the subject. In English, we commonly say 'prayers are offered' (passive form) to indicate that people perform prayers for candidates. Hence 'are offered' fits grammatically and idiomatically.

খ (take): 'Parents take closer watch' is a standard collocation: one 'takes care' or 'takes watch' — here 'take closer watch' communicates that parents increase their vigilance over sleep, diet and study hours.

গ (visit): 'Many families visit shrines or temples' is the natural verb to express going to a religious place to seek blessings. 'Visit' is direct and idiomatic.

ঘ (remain anxious): After the exams, family members typically 'remain anxious' until official results arrive. 'Remain anxious' correctly expresses ongoing worry; alternatives like 'stay nervous' would also work, but 'remain anxious' is most formal and fits the tone.

Question:
During the final admission season, households get unusually involved in rituals and preparations. Relatives sometimes (a) ———— brief pujas at home to invoke luck. Students' guardians (b) ———— their hopes on divine favor while also monitoring applications. Many people (c) ———— food or money at places of worship as an offering for success. Until acceptance letters come, families often (d) ———— with anticipation.

Options:
ক. ফাঁকা (a) পূরণ কর: সঠিক ক্রিয়া কোনটি?
খ. ফাঁকা (b) পূরণ কর: উপযুক্ত ক্রিয়া লিখো
গ. ফাঁকা (c) পূরণ কর: কোন শব্দটি বেশি মানানসই?
ঘ. ফাঁকা (d) পূরণ কর: বাক্যটি শেষ করো


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক perform
খ pin
গ donate
ঘ stay on edge

Explanation:
ক (perform): 'Perform brief pujas' is an appropriate collocation; 'perform' is commonly used with rituals and ceremonies.

খ (pin): The phrase 'pin their hopes on' means to rely on or place one's hopes in something (here, divine favor). Using 'pin' captures that idiomatic meaning succinctly.

গ (donate): 'Donate food or money at places of worship' accurately describes giving offerings for someone’s success. 'Offer' would also work, but 'donate' emphasizes the giving aspect.

ঘ (stay on edge): 'Stay on edge' (or 'remain on edge') conveys sustained anxiety and anticipation while waiting for acceptance letters. It's idiomatic and suits the context better than a neutral word like 'wait.'

Question:
When young athletes prepare for trials or selections, families and fans often combine practical training with hopeful rituals. On the morning of trials supporters (a) ———— small ceremonies or shout blessings at the doorstep. Some relatives (b) ———— fasting or wear specific amulets, believing it helps performance. A number of families (c) ———— to sacred sites before a big event, seeking a positive outcome. Even with careful preparation, everyone (d) ———— until the final scoreboards are posted.

Options:

খ. ফাঁকা (b) পূরণ কর: প্রাসঙ্গিক ক্রিয়া বেছে নাও
গ. ফাঁকা (c) পূরণ কর: উপযুক্ত ক্রিয়া কোনটি?
ঘ. ফাঁকা (d) পূরণ কর: বাক্যটি সম্পন্ন করো


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক perform
খ observe
গ go
ঘ remain tense

Explanation:
ক (perform): 'Perform small ceremonies' matches the action of doing brief ritual acts. 'Perform' is idiomatic when referring to carrying out rituals.

খ (observe): 'Observe fasting' or 'observe rituals' is a conventional phrasing. 'Observe' conveys following or carrying out a customary practice.

গ (go): 'Go to sacred sites' is the natural verb for visiting religious places. 'Visit' could be used, but 'go' keeps the sentence direct and simple.

ঘ (remain tense): 'Remain tense' describes the ongoing nervousness until results appear. It fits naturally in the sporting/trials context where anticipation is high.

Question:
Digital skills are increasingly important in modern education and employment. Across schools, students need opportunities to practice with digital tools, and curricula must respond to technological change. Fill the blanks in the paragraph below with appropriate words or phrases.

It is (a) —— for students to (b) —— current software and to (c) —— new tools. School curricula (d) —— to include more practical computing lessons.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক essential

খ learn

গ experiment with

ঘ should be revised

Explanation:
Detailed reasoning:

ক — "It is essential for students..." is a standard impersonal construction: "It is + adjective + for + noun + to + verb". "Essential" fits the intended meaning better than alternatives like "necessary" or "important" because it emphasizes urgency and core requirement.

খ — After "for students to" we need the base form (infinitive without to is not used here because the construction includes "to" already), so "learn" is correct: "for students to learn current software."

গ — The sentence continues with "and to (c) —— new tools." Using the infinitive "to experiment with" matches the parallel structure ("to learn" / "to experiment with"). "Experiment with" conveys trying out new tools practically.

ঘ — "School curricula (d) —— to include..." calls for a passive modal phrase indicating recommendation: "should be revised". This expresses that curricula ought to be changed (passive voice appropriate because curricula, not agents, are the focus). Other possible forms like "must be revised" would be stronger; "should be revised" is a balanced recommendation.

Community outreach plays a vital role in building public understanding of environmental issues. The following paragraph describes actions taken by different groups. Complete the blanks with suitable words or phrases.

Community workshops are (a) —— to raise awareness. Scientists must (b) —— complex data into clear messages, and schools should encourage students (c) —— community-led climate initiatives. Educational materials (d) —— regularly to reflect the latest research.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক organized

খ translate

গ to participate in

ঘ should be updated

Explanation:
Detailed reasoning:

ক — "Community workshops are organized to raise awareness." The passive "are organized" describes a typical/state action: workshops are arranged for the stated purpose. "Are being organized" would imply an ongoing process; "are organized" is neutral and appropriate here.

খ — "Scientists must translate complex data into clear messages." "Translate" is the correct verb meaning to render technical information into understandable language. The structure "must + base verb" expresses obligation or necessity.

গ — "Schools should encourage students to participate in community-led climate initiatives." The pattern "encourage someone to + verb" requires the infinitive with "to", so "to participate in" is correct and conveys active student involvement.

ঘ — "Educational materials should be updated regularly..." uses the passive modal "should be updated" to indicate that materials ought to be revised periodically to reflect new findings. "Should be updated" is a common phrasing for curriculum or resource maintenance.

Teachers (b) —— professional development so they can design meaningful assessments, and students are encouraged (c) —— hands-on projects rather than memorizing facts. Assessment rubrics (d) —— to ensure transparency and fairness.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক should shift

খ need

গ to undertake

ঘ should be revised

Explanation:
Detailed reasoning:

ক — "The examination system should shift from rote recall to application-based tasks." "Should shift" expresses a recommendation for change in emphasis. Other options like "must shift" would be stronger; "should" is appropriate for a policy suggestion.

খ — "Teachers need professional development..." "Need" indicates necessity: teachers require training to develop and implement new assessments. The construction "Teachers need + noun" or "Teachers need to + verb" both work; here the noun phrase "professional development" follows naturally.

গ — "Students are encouraged to undertake hands-on projects..." The verb pattern "encouraged to + verb" requires the infinitive with "to"; "to undertake" fits well and implies engaging in substantive project work.

ঘ — "Assessment rubrics should be revised to ensure transparency and fairness." "Should be revised" is a passive recommendation indicating that rubrics (rather than people) are the focus of the change. It communicates the need for periodic review and improvement.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)

গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: confined
খ উত্তর: are
গ উত্তর: confined
ঘ উত্তর: stepped out

Explanation:
ক (confined): অনুচ্ছেদে বলা হয়েছে যে অতীতে নারীরা কড়া ঐতিহ্য দ্বারা সীমাবদ্ধ ছিল — ইংরেজিতে 'confined' শব্দটি এই ধারণা বহন করে।

খ (are): বর্তমান সম্পর্কে বলার সময় বর্ণনাটি 'They are no longer ...' যেমন গঠনে আসে; তাই সহায়ক ক্রিয়া 'are' দরকার।

গ (confined): বাক্য গঠন অনুযায়ী 'no longer confined to purely domestic roles' হলো স্বাভাবিক এবং অর্থগতভাবে সঠিক। এখানে 'confined' আবারও ব্যবহার করা হচ্ছে কারণ একই রকম সীমাবদ্ধতার কথা দ্বিতীয়বার বলা হচ্ছে।

ঘ (stepped out): 'have stepped out into public life and leadership' একটি প্রচলিত প্রকাশ; এটি বোঝায় যে নারীরা রান্নাঘর/গৃহকালীন সীমা ছাড়িয়ে বাইরে গিয়ে নেতৃত্ব দিচ্ছেন। 'stepped out' এখানে প্রাসঙ্গিক এবং প্রয়োগযোগ্য।

Options:

গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: kept away
খ উত্তর: have
গ উত্তর: now
ঘ উত্তর: regularly

Explanation:
ক (kept away): অতীতে মেয়েদের উচ্চশিক্ষা থেকে বিচ্ছিন্ন করা হতো; 'kept away' এই বিচ্ছিন্নতার ভাব প্রকাশ করে।

খ (have): 'Nowadays they have far greater opportunities'—এখানে বর্তমান কালের জন্য 'have' (auxiliary for present perfect/simple present context) সঠিক।

গ (now): 'now enroll in universities'—এখানে সময়সূচক শব্দ 'now' ব্যবহার করে বর্তমান অবস্থা নির্দেশ করা হয়েছে; বিকল্পভাবে 'are able to' ব্যবহার করা যেতো, কিন্তু সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে 'now' উপযুক্ত।

ঘ (regularly): বাক্যটির ধারায় 'regularly excel' বা 'often excel' উভয়ই মানানসই; এখানে 'regularly' দিয়ে বোঝানো হয়েছে যে মেয়েরা নিয়মিতভাবে বিজ্ঞান ও ক্রীড়ায় অসাধারণ করতে পারে।

Options:

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: set
খ উত্তর: have grown
গ উত্তর: contributed
ঘ উত্তর: gained

Explanation:
ক (set): 'set up small enterprises' হলো সাধারণ এবং সঠিক collocation — অর্থাৎ ব্যবসা/উদ্যোগ শুরু করা।

খ (have grown): 'have grown them into sustainable businesses' — এখানে present perfect 'have grown' ব্যবহার করে দেখায় যে প্রক্রিয়াটি অতীতে শুরু হয়ে বর্তমানে ফলাফল নিয়ে এসেছে।

গ (contributed): 'contributed to local and national economies' — নারীরা অর্থনীতিতে অবদান রাখছে, তাই 'contributed' সঠিক ক্রিয়া।

ঘ (gained): 'gained recognition at home and abroad' — অর্জন বোঝাতে 'gained recognition' লজিক্যাল; এটি ব্যক্তিগত/প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক সুনামের দুপক্ষকে নির্দেশ করে।

Question:
Rivers and streams supply water for drinking, agriculture and wildlife, yet human actions have harmed them. Complete the verbs in brackets to make the sentences grammatically correct and meaningful.

Options:
ক. River water (a) — (be) essential for life, but it (b) — (pollute) by nearby factories that (c) — (discharge) untreated waste into it.
খ. Farm runoff (d) — (contain) fertilizers which (e) — (cause) algal blooms. People (f) — (throw) domestic sewage and garbage into canals which (g) — (lead) to fish deaths.
গ. If strong measures (h) — (not/take) soon, more species (i) — (lose) their habitats and local communities (j) — (face) water shortages.
ঘ. It is high time we (k) — (clean) the rivers; neighbourhood groups (l) — (come) together to organise clean-ups and prevent further harm.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক River water is essential for life, but it is polluted by nearby factories that discharge untreated waste into it.
খ Farm runoff contains fertilizers which cause algal blooms. People throw domestic sewage and garbage into canals which lead to fish deaths.
গ If strong measures are not taken soon, more species will lose their habitats and local communities will face water shortages.
ঘ It is high time we cleaned the rivers; neighbourhood groups come together to organise clean-ups and prevent further harm.

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'is' — 'River water' is a singular noun, so present simple 'is' is correct. (b) 'is polluted' — passive present simple shows the ongoing state caused by factories. (c) 'discharge' — present simple active for the factories' regular action.

খ: (d) 'contains' — third-person singular present simple. (e) 'cause' — plural noun 'fertilizers' take plural verb. (f) 'throw' — present simple describing habitual improper action. (g) 'lead' — plural 'canals' or the plural action 'which' refers to the preceding clause; 'lead' matches plural subject 'sewage and garbage' as a compound subject.

গ: (h) 'are not taken' — passive voice required because 'measures' are something done (or not done); present simple passive fits the conditional. (i) 'will lose' and (j) 'will face' — future simple because the conditional consequence depends on the measures not being taken.

ঘ: (k) 'cleaned' — after 'It is high time' English uses a past-subjunctive form, so 'cleaned' (not 'clean') is idiomatic. (l) 'come' — present subjunctive/imperative sense (or simple present) works: 'come together' expresses the intended collective action. The choices reflect correct subject-verb agreement, passive vs active voice, tense for conditionals, and idiomatic structures (e.g., 'It is high time').

Question:
Forests provide habitat, regulate climate and protect soil. Humans have been felling trees; complete the verbs in brackets to show the correct tense and voice.

Options:
ক. Huge areas of forest (a) — (cut down) every year to make way for farms. The soil (b) — (become) less fertile after trees (c) — (remove).
খ. Many bird species (d) — (migrate) or (e) — (die) when nesting trees (f) — (destroy) by chainsaws and fires.
গ. If deforestation (g) — (continue), climate patterns (h) — (change) and flood frequency (i) — (increase).
ঘ. To stop this trend, strict laws must (j) — (enforce) and citizens (k) — (plant) more native trees.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Huge areas of forest are cut down every year to make way for farms. The soil becomes less fertile after trees are removed.
খ Many bird species migrate or die when nesting trees are destroyed by chainsaws and fires.
গ If deforestation continues, climate patterns will change and flood frequency will increase.
ঘ To stop this trend, strict laws must be enforced and citizens plant more native trees.

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'are cut down' — passive present simple for a repeated action affecting 'areas of forest'. (b) 'becomes' — singular 'soil' takes singular verb. (c) 'are removed' — passive, since the soil condition follows removal of trees.

খ: (d) 'migrate' and (e) 'die' — present simple for general consequences; plural 'bird species' fit these verbs. (f) 'are destroyed' — passive voice describes what happens to the nesting trees.

গ: (g) 'continues' — present simple for the ongoing action in the 'if' clause. (h) 'will change' and (i) 'will increase' — future simple for consequences in the main clause of a real conditional.

ঘ: (j) 'be enforced' — passive infinitive is required after 'must' when indicating that laws should be enforced by authorities. (k) 'plant' — after 'must' or as part of the proposed action citizens can 'plant' (simple present is used imperatively/obligatory here). The explanation highlights correct use of passive constructions, subject-verb agreement, and the real conditional structure.

খ. This litter (c) — (be) washed into rivers and then the sea, where turtles (d) — (mistake) it for jellyfish.
গ. Municipalities (e) — (collect) recyclables, but a large portion of waste (f) — (not/sort) properly and (g) — (end) up in landfills.
ঘ. If citizens (h) — (take) responsibility and manufacturers (i) — (use) biodegradable materials, plastic pollution (j) — (reduce).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Plastic bags and bottles accumulate in streets and drains after people discard them carelessly.
খ This litter is washed into rivers and then the sea, where turtles mistake it for jellyfish.
গ Municipalities collect recyclables, but a large portion of waste is not sorted properly and ends up in landfills.
ঘ If citizens take responsibility and manufacturers use biodegradable materials, plastic pollution will be reduced.

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'accumulate' — present simple describes an ongoing build-up. (b) 'discard' — present simple for habitual careless action.

খ: (c) 'is washed' — passive present simple to indicate litter being carried by water. (d) 'mistake' — present simple; animals routinely confuse plastic for food.

গ: (e) 'collect' — present simple for municipal action. (f) 'is not sorted' — passive negative; the waste does not undergo proper sorting. (g) 'ends' — present simple describing the eventual result; 'ends up' is a fixed phrase meaning 'to finish in'.

ঘ: (h) 'take' and (i) 'use' — present simple in the 'if' clause for real conditional actions. (j) 'will be reduced' — passive future simple expresses the expected outcome if the conditions are met. The explanations emphasise voice (active vs passive), habitual actions in present simple, and the structure of real conditionals where present tense in the 'if' clause leads to 'will' in the result clause.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক have been living

খ couldn't get used to

গ grew to like

ঘ am settling

Explanation:
ক (have been living): The sentence describes an action that started in the past and continues up to now (three weeks so far). The present perfect continuous 'have been living' correctly expresses this ongoing stay.

খ (couldn't get used to): This refers to the initial difficulty when arriving; a past inability to adjust is best expressed by 'couldn't get used to' or 'wasn't used to'. 'Couldn't get used to' emphasizes the struggle at that time.

গ (grew to like): The writer describes a gradual change in feeling toward shops and neighbours. 'Grew to like' (past tense) conveys that over time she began to like them.

ঘ (am settling): This present progressive indicates the ongoing process of becoming settled. 'Am settling' matches 'these days' and shows she is in the process of adapting to life there.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

খ didn't know

গ learned how

ঘ can see

Explanation:
ক (have been working): 'Since early June' indicates an action that started in the past and continues to the present. The present perfect continuous 'have been working' is appropriate for ongoing volunteer work.

খ (didn't know): Refers to initial uncertainty—'I didn't know how to keep so many little ones engaged' correctly shows past lack of knowledge/skill.

গ (learned how): After some experience she acquired the skill. 'Learned how' (past tense) fits the sequence: first she didn't know, then she learned.

ঘ (can see): The sentence states an observable result in the present—'you can see the difference you make' indicates that the positive impact is noticeable now. 'Can see' is natural and idiomatic here.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক have been staying

খ took

গ wasn't used to

ঘ hope

Explanation:
ক (have been staying): 'Nearly a month' suggests an action that began in the past and continues; 'have been staying' (present perfect continuous) fits well for temporary residence during research.

খ (took): The phrase 'the humidity ... took me by surprise' is an idiomatic way to say it was unexpected. 'Took' (past tense) matches the narrative about initial reactions.

গ (wasn't used to): Describes inability to tolerate or be familiar with sudden heavy rains in the past. 'Wasn't used to' properly conveys that she hadn't experienced such conditions before.

ঘ (hope): Expressing a future desire or plan, 'hope to return' is the natural, concise choice here. Alternatives could be 'plan to return' or 'would like to return,' but 'hope' conveys the writer's wish combined with intention.

A young biochemist (a) ——— that a particular enzyme accelerates cellular repair. She (b) ——— the claim with controlled experiments. Some initial trials (c) ———, but she chose to (d) ——— her methods and finally (e) ——— the positive results in a journal.

Options:
ক. Which verb best fills blank (a)?
খ. Which verb best fills blank (b)?
গ. Which verb best fills blank (c)?
ঘ. Which verb best fills blank (d)?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক hypothesized

খ tested

গ failed

ঘ repeat

Explanation:
বিবেচনা: 
- (a) 'hypothesized' উপযুক্ত কারণ তিনি একটি বৈজ্ঞানিক অনুমান করেছেন — তালিকার 'hypothesize'। 
- (b) 'tested' অর্থ তিনি তার অনুমান যাচাই করার জন্য পরীক্ষাগুলো সম্পন্ন করেছেন — তালিকার 'test'। 
- (c) 'failed' মানানসই কারণ প্রথম কিছু ট্রায়াল ব্যর্থ হয়েছে; তালিকার 'fail' এইটি বোঝায়। 
- (d) 'repeat' সঠিক কারণ ব্যর্থতার পর তিনি পদ্ধতিগুলো পুনরায় চালিয়ে বা সংশোধন করে পরীক্ষাসমূহ পুনরাবৃত্তি করেছেন; তালিকার 'repeat' এখানে প্রযোজ্য।

Question:
Choose appropriate verbs from the box to complete the passage meaningfully.

[try   resist   heed   indulge   realize   repair   boast   derail]

Many graduates (a)_____ in expensive lifestyles soon after getting their first jobs. They (b)_____ the warnings of experienced colleagues and often (c)_____ the long-term costs. Such extravagance (d)_____ their future savings and career plans. When they finally (e)_____ the financial harm, it becomes hard to (f)_____ the lost opportunities.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blanks (d), (e), (f)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক indulge

Explanation: "Indulge in" is the correct collocation to indicate giving in to pleasures or luxury. Here graduates give themselves over to expensive lifestyles.

খ ignore (i.e., do NOT heed)

Explanation: From the box the closest intended meaning is that they do not follow advice. "Heed" means to pay attention; the sentence says they fail to follow warnings, so grammatically we place "ignore" (the negative of heed). If constrained to box words, use "heed" with a negative: "do not heed".

গ realize

Explanation: "Realize" fits because it means to become aware of the long-term costs. It is the natural verb to express sudden awareness.

ঘ derail / realize / repair

Explanation: (d) "derail" — their extravagance derails (disrupts) future savings and plans. (e) "realize" — when they come to understand the harm (if not already used at (c), use "come to realize"). (f) "repair" — to fix or mend the damage; "repair" or "mend" from the box conveys restoring what's broken. Note: If (c) already uses "realize", (e) can be phrased "recognize later" or "come to see"; the key verbs are derail (d) and repair/mend (f).

Explanation:
Overall reasoning: Choose verbs that match collocations and intended meanings. "Indulge in" pairs with "lifestyles". Advice is "heeded" or "ignored"; context indicates they do not follow advice, so use a negative construction if using "heed." "Realize" is the typical verb for becoming aware of consequences. "Derail" conveys gradual disruption of plans or savings. Finally, "repair/mend" is the natural verb for restoring damage. Ensure grammatical fits (e.g., use "do not heed" rather than bare "heed" when sentence requires negation).

Question:
Complete the workplace scenario using suitable verbs from the box.

[prioritize   procrastinate   undermine   salvage   adhere   embrace   overlook   escalate]

In a busy office, some employees (a)_____ routine tasks until deadlines loom. Managers urge them to (b)_____ critical work and (c)_____ healthy time-management habits. If small issues are (d)_____ repeatedly, they can (e)_____ into crises that (f)_____ team morale. Later the team tries to (g)_____ what remains salvageable.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blanks (d), (e), (f), (g)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক procrastinate

Explanation: "Procrastinate" means to delay or postpone tasks, fitting employees who put off routine work.

খ prioritize

Explanation: Managers ask them to "prioritize"—give precedence to critical work—this contrasts with procrastination.

গ embrace / adhere to

Explanation: Two possible verbs fit: "embrace" healthy habits (accept and adopt them) or "adhere to" time-management habits (follow them consistently). Both capture encouragement to adopt better practices.

ঘ overlook / escalate / undermine / salvage

Explanation: (d) "overlook" — small issues are often overlooked or ignored. (e) "escalate" — if repeated, small problems can escalate (grow worse). (f) "undermine" — escalating problems can undermine team morale. (g) "salvage" — the team later attempts to salvage whatever is left, i.e., recover or save remaining work. These verbs connect cause and effect in workplace dynamics.

Explanation:
Explanation:
ক procrastinate, খ prioritize, গ adhere; ঘ overlooked, escalate, undermine, salvage. These choices fit both meaning and grammar: employees "procrastinate" (delay), managers tell them to "prioritize" important work and "adhere" to time-management habits, and if issues are "overlooked" they can "escalate" into crises that "undermine" morale, after which the team tries to "salvage" what remains.

Question:
Fill the blanks in the community/environment passage using verbs from the box.

[neglect   acknowledge   adopt   contribute   exacerbate   mitigate   eradicate   celebrate]

When residents (a)_____ small acts of pollution, the community's environment slowly (b)_____. Civic groups encourage people to (c)_____ simple habits—recycling, reducing waste—that (d)_____ harm over time. If everyone (e)_____ even minor responsibilities, collective effort can (f)_____ the problem rather than (g)_____ it. When improvements occur, neighbors should (h)_____ the progress.

Options:
ক. Fill blanks (a) and (b)
খ. Fill blanks (c) and (d)
গ. Fill blanks (e) and (f)
ঘ. Fill blank (g) and (h)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক neglect / deteriorate (or exacerbate)

Explanation: (a) "neglect" fits: residents neglect small acts of pollution. (b) The environment then "deteriorates" or "suffers"; from the box, "exacerbate" means to make worse—so "the community's environment slowly deteriorates, and neglect exacerbates the decline." Use "deteriorate" for the direct verb; "exacerbate" can describe the effect of neglect.

খ adopt / mitigate

Explanation: (c) "adopt" simple habits means to start practicing them. (d) Those habits "mitigate" harm—reduce or alleviate environmental damage.

গ acknowledge / eradicate

Explanation: (e) "acknowledge" that minor responsibilities matter; recognizing the role of each person is essential. Alternatively, (e) could be "contribute" in a positive sense: "If everyone contributes even minor efforts..." (f) "eradicate" is strong—collective effort can help eradicate some problems entirely; more modestly, collective effort can "mitigate" or "reduce" the problem. Choose "contribute" for (e) and "mitigate" for (f) for natural flow.

ঘ exacerbate / celebrate

Explanation: (g) If people do not act, they "exacerbate" the issue (make it worse). (h) When improvements occur, neighbors should "celebrate" the progress. Together: failure to act exacerbates problems; positive action warrants celebration.

Explanation:
Reasoning: Match verbs to collocations and intended nuance. "Neglect" pairs with small harmful acts that are ignored. Environmental conditions "deteriorate" or problems "exacerbate" under neglect. Communities are encouraged to "adopt" habits that "mitigate" damage. Individual actions should "contribute" to solutions; collective action can "mitigate" or even "eradicate" problems depending on scale. Failure to act "exacerbates" issues, while successful outcomes deserve to be "celebrated." Choose the precise verb based on desired strength (e.g., mitigate vs eradicate).

Question:
It was a sunny Saturday. My friends and I went to the beach. We (ক) ____ the shore before noon. Then we (খ) ____ our mats, (গ) ____ into the sea, and later (ঘ) ____ some cold drinks from a nearby stall.

Options:
ক. Fill (ক): We ____ the shore before noon.
খ. Fill (খ): Then we ____ our mats.
গ. Fill (গ): Then we ____ into the sea.
ঘ. Fill (ঘ): Later we ____ some cold drinks from a nearby stall.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক arrived
খ spread
গ waded
ঘ bought

Explanation:
ক — 'arrived' is the correct past-tense verb to indicate reaching the shore (we arrived at/ to the shore/the beach). খ — 'spread' collocates with 'mats' (we spread our mats). গ — 'waded' (or 'went') into the sea describes entering the water gradually; 'swam' would be possible later but 'waded' fits the immediate action of going into shallow water. ঘ — 'bought' is the past form meaning we purchased cold drinks from the stall. All verbs are in past tense to match the narrative.

Options:
ক. Fill (ক): We ____ at the main gate.

গ. Fill (গ): We ____ the interactive exhibits.
ঘ. Fill (ঘ): Suddenly, my brother ____ a robot demonstration.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক queued
খ purchased
গ explored
ঘ spotted

Explanation:
ক — 'queued' (or 'waited') indicates standing in line at the gate; it fits a museum entrance scenario. খ — 'purchased' correctly expresses buying tickets (past tense). গ — 'explored' suits moving around and looking at interactive exhibits. ঘ — 'spotted' means he noticed/seen the robot demonstration and then called the family; alternatives like 'saw' are possible but 'spotted' emphasizes he noticed it from a distance. All choices are in past tense to match the rest of the story.

গ. Fill (গ): We ____ snacks for the trip.
ঘ. Fill (ঘ): Finally we ____ at the checkout counter.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক grabbed
খ chose
গ picked
ঘ paid

Explanation:
ক — 'grabbed' (or 'picked up') describes taking hold of a trolley at the start of shopping. খ — 'chose' describes selecting items from the fresh produce section (past tense). গ — 'picked' is used for selecting snacks (fits with 'picked some snacks'). ঘ — 'paid' is the action at the checkout counter when completing the purchase. Each verb is in past tense to be consistent with the narrative timeframe.

Question:
A travelling minstrel arrived at the royal city. There (a) — a king who loved music, and he (b) — the minstrel to play at his court. During the performance the minstrel (c) — something true about the court that made the king uneasy. Enraged, the king (d) — the minstrel away from the palace.

Options:
ক. Fill in (a): Which verb form correctly completes the sentence?
খ. Fill in (b): Which verb best fits the context?
গ. Fill in (c): Choose the appropriate reporting verb.
ঘ. Fill in (d): Which verb expresses the king's action after he was angered?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক was
খ summoned/called on
গ revealed/told
ঘ drove/expelled

Explanation:
ক: 'There was a king' is the natural past simple statement establishing existence in the past. 'There lived a king' would also be possible, but 'was' is the simplest and most direct.

খ: 'Summoned' or 'called on' fits because a king typically invites or orders someone to perform at court. 'Asked' could work informally, but 'summoned' shows the king's authority.

গ: 'Revealed' or 'told' fits the meaning: the minstrel 'told' something unpleasant (reported a truth). 'Said' is possible but less precise about reporting facts.

ঘ: After becoming angry the king 'drove' the minstrel away or 'expelled' him from the palace. 'Put to death' would be much stronger and must match the story's tone; here 'drove/expelled' conveys removal.

Notes on grammar: Past simple is used throughout to describe a sequence of past events. Reported actions typically use verbs like 'told' or 'revealed'; commands or orders from royalty are often expressed with 'summoned'/'called on.'

Question:
In a border town there (a) — an old merchant who (b) — a rumor about a drought. Worried, the villagers (c) — him to advise them. The merchant (d) — them to store grain and mend the wells.

Options:
ক. Fill in (a): Choose the verb to introduce the merchant.
খ. Fill in (b): Which verb expresses that the merchant spread a rumor?
গ. Fill in (c): Which verb shows the villagers’ action to seek help?
ঘ. Fill in (d): Which verb correctly indicates the merchant's recommendation?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক lived
খ had heard/spread
গ called on/sought out
ঘ advised/urged

Explanation:
ক: 'There lived an old merchant' is idiomatic for describing a person residing in the town. 'There was' is also correct; 'lived' emphasizes residence.

খ: 'Had heard' suggests he possessed the information; 'spread' indicates he circulated the rumor. Use 'had heard' if you mean he came to know the rumor earlier; use 'spread' if he actively told others.

গ: The villagers 'called on' or 'sought out' the merchant to ask for advice—these phrases imply approaching someone intentionally for help.

ঘ: 'Advised' or 'urged' properly describes the merchant recommending precautionary measures. 'Told' is possible but less formal; 'advised' conveys counsel.

Notes: Be consistent with past tense: past perfect ('had heard') can show an event that occurred before the main past events; simple past ('spread') indicates it happened as part of the narrative sequence.

Options:
ক. Fill in (a): Which past-tense verb completes the movement verb?
খ. Fill in (b): Choose the correct verb to describe the prophet's residence.
গ. Fill in (c): Which verb shows the shepherd's request?
ঘ. Fill in (d): Which verb fits the prophet's act of imparting a warning?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক walked/travelled
খ was living/lived
গ went to/approached
ঘ gave/told

Explanation:
ক: 'Walked' or 'travelled' in the past simple describes the shepherd's movement across the moor. Either verb is natural depending on tone.

খ: 'Was living' emphasizes continuous habitation at that time; 'lived' is also fine for simple past description.

গ: 'Went to' or 'approached' indicates the shepherd moved toward the prophet with intent to request something. 'Called on' could also be used but 'went to' is straightforward.

ঘ: 'Gave' (a warning) or 'told' him a warning both work: 'gave' collocates with nouns like 'a warning,' while 'told' collocates with 'a warning' or 'him a warning.'

Grammar note: Use past simple for sequential actions. Use continuous past ('was living') to stress ongoing states in the past. Collocations matter: 'gave a warning' vs. 'told him a warning'—both acceptable, though 'gave a warning' is slightly more idiomatic.

Word bank: (piled, educated, enforce, improve)

The city has launched a cleanliness drive. Most street corners (a) — with discarded packaging and leaves because public bins are few. If citizens are (b) — about the environmental and health effects they might stop littering. The municipality should (c) — the penalties for dumping waste illegally. With sustained effort habits will (d) — over time.

Options:
ক. (a) —
খ. (b) —
গ. (c) —
ঘ. (d) —


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক are piled
খ educated
গ enforce
ঘ improve

Explanation:
ক (are piled): The sentence describes a present situation at many street corners. The passive present simple 'are piled' correctly indicates that rubbish accumulates there (subject receives the action).

খ (educated): 'If citizens are educated about…' uses the past participle 'educated' as part of a passive construction meaning 'made aware' or 'informed'.

গ (enforce): After 'should' or when giving a recommendation, the base form 'enforce' is used: 'The municipality should enforce the penalties...'.

ঘ (improve): 'Will' is followed by the base verb, so 'will improve' correctly expresses future gradual change in habits.

Vaccines must (c) — by trained health workers at designated centres. Meanwhile, public confidence and awareness should (d) — so people accept the programme.

Options:
ক. (a) —
খ. (b) —
গ. (c) —
ঘ. (d) —


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক are rolled out
খ fall
গ be administered
ঘ be built

Explanation:
ক (are rolled out): 'Are rolled out' is present passive to indicate programmes being launched across areas.

খ (fall): In the clause 'infection rates (b) —' the correct verb is 'fall' (present simple) to state the general effect of high immunization coverage.

গ (be administered): 'Must' + passive infinitive is required because the sentence emphasizes that vaccines should receive proper handling: 'must be administered by trained health workers.'

ঘ (be built): 'Public confidence and awareness should be built' uses passive infinitive 'be built' after 'should' to express that trust needs to be developed/strengthened.

Correct Answer:

ক occur
খ be reported
গ prevent

Explanation:
ক (occur): 'Most accidents occur when...' uses the simple present to state a general truth or regular observation.

খ (be reported): 'Must' + passive infinitive 'be reported' is appropriate because near misses should be reported (the action is done to the incident, not by it).

গ (prevent): 'Help' or 'regular training ... help prevent such incidents' takes the base verb 'prevent' after 'help' or as the object of 'help'.

ঘ (take): 'Management should take responsibility' uses 'should' + base verb 'take' to recommend that management accept and act on their obligations.

On a cool autumn morning I (a) — at the dew on the grass. I (b) — through the slightly fogged window to watch the old elm. The distant bell tower (c) — like a memory from a postcard. Down the lane the neighbors (d) — in twos and threes, exchanging cheerful greetings.

খ. Fill blank (b) with the correct verb form from the bank.
গ. Fill blank (c) with the correct verb form from the bank.
ঘ. Fill blank (d) with the correct verb form from the bank.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: gazed ("I gazed at the dew on the grass.")

খ Answer: peered ("I peered through the slightly fogged window.")

গ Answer: seemed ("The distant bell tower seemed like a memory from a postcard.")

ঘ Answer: gathered ("The neighbors gathered in twos and threes.")

Explanation:
ক: "gazed" is the correct past-tense verb for looking steadily at something nearby ("gaze at"). It fits the reflective mood of observing dew.

খ: "peered" (past of "peer") means to look closely or with difficulty, appropriate for looking through a fogged window; "peered through" is idiomatic.

গ: "seemed" expresses appearance or impression; "the bell tower seemed like..." is the natural collocation to describe how it looked to the narrator.

ঘ: "gathered" (past of "gather") indicates people coming together in small groups; it matches the plural subject "the neighbors" and the sense of assembling in twos and threes. Other forms like "gather" (base) would be grammatically incorrect in this past-tense narrative context.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: hurried (past tense of "hurry")

খ Answer: glowed (past tense of "glow")

গ Answer: loitered (past tense of "loiter")

ঘ Answer: murmured (past tense of "murmur")

Explanation:
ক: The narrator describes movement after a day, so the past tense "hurried" matches the narrative time and the sense of going home briskly.

খ: "Glowed" conveys the steady warm light emitted by shop windows; "the shop windows glowed" is idiomatic and fits the sensory image.

গ: "Loitered" means to linger aimlessly or hang around; it fits teenagers hanging near the bakery and being "reluctant to go inside."

ঘ: "Murmured" is appropriate for quietly singing or speaking under one's breath; it matches "a line from a song under my breath." Using past-tense forms throughout maintains consistent narrative tense.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: sat (past tense of "sit")

খ Answer: glimmered (past tense of "glimmer")

গ Answer: rested (past tense of "rest")

ঘ Answer: rolled (past tense of "roll")

Explanation:
ক: "Sat" is the simple past of "sit" and fits the past-tense narration: "I sat on the porch steps."

খ: "Glimmered" describes small, intermittent light like that of fireflies; it is the apt past-tense choice to match the scene.

গ: "Rested" indicates the dog was lying quietly and contentedly. Although "lie" could become "lay," "rested" is clearer and unambiguous here and matches the calm mood.

ঘ: "Rolled" conveys the slow movement of a cart along the lane; it matches the auditory image and keeps tense consistent. "Passed" would also be possible, but given the bank includes "roll," "rolled" is the best fit.

[math]\boxed{\rm{pray\qquad prepare\qquad donate\qquad guide\qquad hope\qquad calm\qquad support}}[/math]

During university entrance season many households feel tense. Parents (a) ———— to seek blessings and better outcomes. They (b) ———— by arranging special meals, study schedules and quiet spaces at home. At times they (c) ———— a little money or offerings to nearby shrines for good luck. Family elders also (d) ———— the candidate with advice and supervision until the final list is published.

Options:
ক. (a) পূরণ করুন
খ. (b) পূরণ করুন
গ. (c) পূরণ করুন
ঘ. (d) পূরণ করুন


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: pray

খ উত্তর: prepare

গ উত্তর: donate

ঘ উত্তর: guide

Explanation:
ক (pray): Families often resort to prayer to seek blessings before important exams, so "pray" fits the blank.

খ (prepare): Organizing meals, schedules and quiet study environments are activities of preparation, therefore "prepare" matches here.

গ (donate): The sentence mentions giving money or offerings to shrines, which corresponds to "donate".

ঘ (guide): Elders giving advice and supervision is best described by "guide". Each chosen verb fits semantically with its clause and the overall context of pre-exam family behavior.

Question:
Words in the box: {shape, define, guarantee, bring, ensure, foster}. Success (a) —— our sense of purpose. How we (b) —— success often varies with upbringing and values. To think that wealth (c) —— happiness is a common mistake. What (d) —— lasting contentment is deeper relationships and inner growth.

Options:
ক. ফাঁক (a) পূরণ করুন
খ. ফাঁক (b) পূরণ করুন
গ. ফাঁক (c) পূরণ করুন
ঘ. ফাঁক (d) পূরণ করুন


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: shape (Success shapes our sense of purpose.)
খ উত্তর: define (How we define success often varies with upbringing and values.)
গ উত্তর: guarantee (To think that wealth guarantees happiness is a common mistake.)
ঘ উত্তর: foster (What fosters lasting contentment is deeper relationships and inner growth.)

Explanation:
ক — 'shape' fits because the sentence means success influences or molds our sense of purpose; 'shape' conveys that influence. খ — 'define' is appropriate since different backgrounds cause people to give different definitions to success. গ — 'guarantee' completes the negative observation: believing wealth guarantees happiness is mistaken; 'guarantee' is the verb usually used in this phrase. ঘ — 'foster' (or 'bring about' / 'ensure') is best here: lasting contentment is promoted or fostered by relationships and inner growth. Each chosen verb matches the intended meaning and grammatical structure of the sentence.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: fuels (Education fuels progress in society.)
খ উত্তর: guarantee (But knowledge alone does not guarantee success; effort and application are needed.)
গ উত্তর: translate (We must translate theory into practice to see real results.)
ঘ উত্তর: nurture (A good mentor will nurture a student's curiosity and confidence.)

Explanation:
ক — 'fuels' conveys that education provides the energy or impetus for societal progress. খ — 'guarantee' is correct because the sentence warns that mere knowledge isn't a sure promise of success. গ — 'translate' is the verb commonly used for converting theory into practical application. ঘ — 'nurture' matches the idea that mentors cultivate and encourage a student's inner qualities. All verbs were chosen to match collocations and the intended meanings in context.

Words in the box: {rests, cement, demand, sustain, require, strengthen}. True friendship (a) —— on mutual trust and respect. Shared hardships and laughter (b) —— the bonds between people.

গ উত্তর: require (To keep ties strong, relationships require small acts of kindness and patience.)
ঘ উত্তর: sustain (Over time, honesty and care sustain loyalty.)

Explanation:
ক — 'rests on' is the standard phrase meaning 'is based on'; it properly expresses the foundation of friendship. খ — 'cement' metaphorically means to make bonds firm or solid; shared experiences often cement relationships. গ — 'require' fits because maintaining relationships needs continual effort such as kindness and patience. ঘ — 'sustain' is appropriate as it indicates honesty and care preserve or uphold loyalty over time. Each word was chosen for natural collocation and precise semantic fit with the sentence.

Question:
Over the last fifty years several global changes have occurred that affected health, biodiversity and communication. Many new viruses and bacterial strains (a) — (discover) by epidemiologists. Vaccines and treatments (b) — (develop) in response. Conservation projects (c) — (launch) to protect threatened species. Meanwhile, the rise of the internet (d) — (alter) how communities interact. Low-lying islands (e) — (threaten) by rising seas.

Options:
ক. Fill the blanks (a) and (b) with correct verb forms.
খ. Fill the blank (c) with the correct verb form.
গ. Fill the blank (d) with the correct verb form.
ঘ. Fill the blank (e) with the correct verb form.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) have been discovered; (b) have been developed.

খ (c) have been launched.

গ (d) has altered.

ঘ (e) have been threatened.

Explanation:
General reasoning:
- The paragraph describes changes over the past fifty years leading up to the present, so present perfect is the best choice to show actions that occurred over a period up to now.
- (a) "have been discovered": discoveries of new viruses/strains are events affecting the present; passive is appropriate because the agent (scientists) is not the focus.
- (b) "have been developed": vaccines/treatments are typically described in the passive when the emphasis is on the treatments rather than the developers.
- (c) "have been launched": conservation projects started during this period and the passive is natural here.
- (d) "has altered": "the rise of the internet" is a singular phenomenon; present perfect or present perfect simple could be used, but "has altered" (present perfect) emphasizes change up to now. One could also accept "has transformed".
- (e) "have been threatened": "low-lying islands" is plural; using the present perfect passive emphasizes the ongoing state produced by sea-level rise. Simple present passive ("are threatened") would stress current state, while present perfect passive stresses the development of that threat over time.

Question:
The twentieth century witnessed dramatic political and cultural shifts. Entire cities (a) — (grow) rapidly as people moved in from rural areas. Radical ideas (b) — (spread) through pamphlets, radio and later television. Several unjust governments (c) — (topple) after mass protests. Economic gaps between classes (d) — (widen). Many celebrated novels (e) — (write) in regional languages and (f) — (translate) for international readers. New art movements (g) — (inspire) generations of creators.

Options:
ক. Fill the blanks (a) and (b) with correct verb forms.
খ. Fill the blanks (c) and (d) with correct verb forms.
গ. Fill the blanks (e) and (f) with correct verb forms.
ঘ. Fill the blank (g) with the correct verb form.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) grew; (b) spread.

খ (c) were toppled; (d) widened.

গ (e) were written; (f) were translated.

ঘ (g) inspired.

Explanation:
General reasoning:
- The paragraph situates events in a past century using past-time framing words (e.g., "witnessed"), so simple past or past passive is appropriate.
- (a) "grew": cities increased in size; active simple past fits because the sentence describes what happened.
- (b) "spread": ideas moved quickly; simple past active is natural.
- (c) "were toppled": governments being removed is better in the passive when the agents are unspecified and the result is emphasized.
- (d) "widened": economic gaps increased over that historical period → simple past.
- (e) "were written" and (f) "were translated": literary works being produced and later translated are often described in the past passive, focusing on the works rather than the authors/translators.
- (g) "inspired": new movements acted on later creators; simple past is consistent with the historical narrative.

Question:
Planners and scientists look toward mid-century scenarios. By 2050, comprehensive climate policies (a) — (implement) in many countries, and renewable energy capacity (b) — (expand) dramatically. City authorities predict that subway and bus systems (c) — (upgrade) to handle larger populations. Nevertheless, social inequalities (d) — (remain) a concern and some regions (e) — (suffer) more frequent heatwaves.

Options:
ক. Fill the blanks (a) and (b) with correct verb forms (consider the time marker 'By 2050').
খ. Fill the blank (c) with the correct verb form.
গ. Fill the blank (d) with the correct verb form.
ঘ. Fill the blank (e) with the correct verb form.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) will have been implemented; (b) will have expanded.

খ (c) will be upgraded.

গ (d) will remain.

ঘ (e) will suffer.

Explanation:
General reasoning:
- The presence of a future time marker "By 2050" signals the use of future perfect (to indicate actions completed before that future time) or future simple for states/events at that future time.
- (a) "will have been implemented": passive future perfect indicates that the implementation is expected to be completed by 2050.
- (b) "will have expanded": future perfect (active) shows the growth completed by that time.
- (c) "will be upgraded": future simple passive describes scheduled/planned upgrades at or before that time.
- (d) "will remain": future simple for an expected ongoing state.
- (e) "will suffer": future simple for predicted adverse events.
- Choice between "will have been implemented" and a simpler "will be implemented" depends on emphasis: the future perfect stresses completion by 2050; the future simple stresses the planned action without focusing on completion timing.

Explanation:
ক (departed): The paragraph refers to scheduled historical departures, so the past tense 'departed' is correct.\nখ (carried): To indicate transporting people in the past, 'carried' (past tense) is appropriate.\nগ (connected): The train linked major capitals; 'connected' in past tense expresses that service.\nঘ (ran): Describing its longstanding operation and reputation, 'ran' (past tense) is the suitable choice. All blanks use past-tense verbs to match the historical narration.

গ. (c) ———
ঘ. (d) ———


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক launched
খ carried
গ landed
ঘ returned

Explanation:
ক (launched): The rocket was sent into space in the past, so 'launched' is the correct past-tense verb.\nখ (carried): The spacecraft transported the astronauts; 'carried' matches the past action.\nগ (landed): The lunar module touched down on the Moon — 'landed' accurately describes that event.\nঘ (returned): After the mission the crew came back to Earth; 'returned' in past tense completes the historical sequence. The context is historical, so all verbs are in the past tense to reflect completed actions.

Boxed words: { beheld    barred    vanished    retained }

Emily Dickinson (a)____ the small, startling events of the day. Even when the cottage shutter (b)____ at dusk and the maple (c)____ from the lane, she (d)____ a delicate outline of its branches in memory.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a).
খ. Fill blank (b).
গ. Fill blank (c).
ঘ. Fill blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক beheld

খ barred

গ vanished

ঘ retained

Explanation:
ক — 'beheld' is the past form of 'behold' and fits the past-tense context: Emily observed or "beheld" small events. খ — 'barred' describes the shutter being closed/fastened at dusk; 'barred' is appropriate and past-tense. গ — 'vanished' correctly expresses that the maple disappeared from view. ঘ — 'retained' means she kept or held the memory; it explains that although the tree had vanished, an outline was still kept in her mind. Grammatically each chosen past-participial/past-tense verb matches the sequence of events and preserves parallel tense.

The verbs are chosen to maintain consistent past narration and to reflect sensory perception followed by imaginative response.

All choices maintain past-tense consistency and clear semantic roles (possession of memory, physical state, visual effect, and emotional response).

After the coastal storm of 1952 the small harbour town (a) ——–. Many families (b) ——– their houses and sought shelter inland. Several fishermen (c) ——– badly by flying debris. For years the residents (d) ——– to restore the pier and basic services.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a): choose the correct form of a word from the box.
খ. Fill blank (b): choose the correct form of a word from the box.
গ. Fill blank (c): choose the correct form of a word from the box.
ঘ. Fill blank (d): choose the correct form of a word from the box.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক was devastated

খ abandoned

গ were injured

ঘ struggled

Explanation:
ক: The passive past tense "was devastated" fits because the town was affected by an external force (the storm); "devastate" in passive describes widespread damage.

খ: "Abandoned" (past tense) correctly describes families leaving their houses; it is a transitive verb here and matches the subject "Many families".

গ: "Were injured" uses the passive to show that the fishermen suffered injuries inflicted by the event (flying debris). "Injured" from the box fits naturally in passive form.

ঘ: "Struggled" (past tense of "struggle") conveys prolonged difficulty in restoring infrastructure. Other words like "rebuild" could appear, but "struggled to rebuild" is the natural phrasing given the blank and context; using "struggled" followed by "to restore" emphasizes ongoing effort.

খ. Fill blank (b): choose the correct form of a word from the box.
গ. Fill blank (c): choose the correct form of a word from the box.
ঘ. Fill blank (d): choose the correct form of a word from the box.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক migrated

খ encountered

গ adapted

ঘ provide

Explanation:
ক: "Migrated" (past tense) correctly describes people moving from rural to urban areas.

খ: "Encountered" fits the context of facing problems: newcomers encountered cramped housing and poor sanitation.

গ: "Adapted" indicates that some migrants adjusted to urban life by learning new skills and routines; the past tense matches the narrative.

ঘ: "Provide" is used in the infinitive phrase "aimed to provide basic services"; grammatically the structure "aimed to + verb" requires the base form, so "provide" (not "provided") is correct here. The government reforms aimed to provide services, hence the base verb form.

খ. Fill blank (b): choose the correct form of a word from the box.
গ. Fill blank (c): choose the correct form of a word from the box.
ঘ. Fill blank (d): choose the correct form of a word from the box.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক contain

খ overwhelm

গ isolate

ঘ vaccinate

Explanation:
ক: "Contain" is the appropriate present infinitive after "moved quickly to" (moved quickly to contain cases and trace contacts) — it conveys limiting further transmission.

খ: "Overwhelm" fits because the phrase describes a threat to hospitals; "threatened to overwhelm local hospitals" is an idiomatic and grammatical construction.

গ: "Isolate" (base form after "advised people to") is correct: authorities advised people to isolate at home when symptomatic.

ঘ: "Vaccinate" in the infinitive is used with "launched campaigns to"; campaigns were launched to vaccinate high-risk groups. Each verb choice matches tense and grammatical structure required by the surrounding verbs and connectors.

Question:
In a remote hamlet there (a) — (run) a tiny tea shop. The owner (b) — (serve) travelers every morning and soon the little place (c) — (become) the villagers' favourite. One autumn, a renowned food critic (d) — (visit) the shop unexpectedly.

Options:
ক. (a) — (run) a tiny tea shop.
খ. (b) — (serve) travelers every morning.
গ. (c) — (become) the villagers' favourite.
ঘ. (d) — (visit) the shop unexpectedly.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: ran. খ Answer: served. গ Answer: became. ঘ Answer: visited.

Explanation:
ক (a) — 'ran': The context is a past-tense narrative describing a situation in the hamlet. 'There ran a tiny tea shop' or 'a tiny tea shop ran there' uses past simple to state its existence in the past.খ (b) — 'served': The phrase 'served travelers every morning' describes a habitual past activity of the owner, so past simple 'served' is appropriate.গ (c) — 'became': The change of status ('soon the little place became the villagers' favourite') is a completed event in the past; past simple 'became' fits.ঘ (d) — 'visited': The critic's unexpected arrival is a single past event during the narrated period; past simple 'visited' is the correct choice. Overall, the passage is told in simple past, so past simple verbs are used for the sequential events and habitual actions.

Options:
ক. (a) — (build) a peculiar clock in his tiny workshop.
খ. (b) — (not/test) it fully before the village fair.
গ. (c) — (stop) moving during his demonstration.
ঘ. (d) — (repair) it on the spot.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: had built. খ Answer: had not tested. গ Answer: stopped. ঘ Answer: repaired.

Explanation:
ক (a) — 'had built': The building of the clock occurred before the fair/demonstration. Using past perfect ('had built') indicates this earlier completed action relative to the later events.খ (b) — 'had not tested': Similarly, the failure to fully test the clock happened prior to the demonstration; past perfect negative ('had not tested') shows that omission happened earlier and had consequences.গ (c) — 'stopped': The clock's stopping is the main event during the demonstration; simple past 'stopped' describes that single event.ঘ (d) — 'repaired': The inventor's immediate action during the show is also a past single event — simple past 'repaired' is appropriate. Using past perfect for the preparatory actions (building, not testing) and simple past for events at the demonstration clarifies the sequence of events.

খ. (b) — (realize) that he ...
গ. (c) — (leave) his revision notes at home.
ঘ. (d) — (remain) composed and completed the paper confidently.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: had been studying. খ Answer: realized. গ Answer: had left. ঘ Answer: remained.

Explanation:
ক (a) — 'had been studying': The past perfect continuous ('had been studying') emphasizes the ongoing action that continued up to the period just before the exam (weeks of late-night study). It sets the background.খ (b) — 'realized': The moment of realization is a single past event that occurred on the morning of the exam; simple past 'realized' is correct for that instantaneous event.গ (c) — 'had left': Leaving the notes at home happened before the moment he realized it; past perfect 'had left' places that action earlier than 'realized.' ঘ (d) — 'remained': His composed state during and after the realization is described as a reaction in the past; simple past 'remained' suits this. The mix of past perfect continuous (background), past perfect (earlier completed action), and simple past (events and reactions) clarifies the chronology and duration of actions.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

ঘ supported

Explanation:
ক: 'had planned' is correct because the engineers first made a plan for the satellite; past simple 'planned' fits the narrative of completed action.\nখ: 'built' is the past form of 'build' and suits 'they ... last summer' (completed action in the past).\nগ: 'took' is the past form of 'take' and is commonly used in the phrase 'took many months' to indicate the duration required for testing.\nঘ: 'supported' (past of 'support') correctly shows that volunteers provided assistance during assembly and checks. All verbs are in the past simple to maintain a consistent past-tense timeline.

Options:
ক. (a) তে কোন শব্দটি ব্যবহার করবেন?
খ. (b) তে কোন শব্দটি ব্যবহার করবেন?
গ. (c) তে কোন শব্দটি ব্যবহার করবেন?
ঘ. (d) তে কোন শব্দটি ব্যবহার করবেন?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক experimented
খ created
গ required
ঘ published

Explanation:
ক: 'experimented' (past of 'experiment') shows they tried different combinations over time.\nখ: 'created' (past of 'create') indicates the chef made the signature sauce last month — a completed past action.\nগ: 'required' (past of 'require') fits the structure 'It required numerous adjustments' to describe how many steps were necessary.\nঘ: 'published' (past of 'publish') is appropriate because the action of putting the recipe in a magazine is a completed event. The past tense is used throughout to narrate a sequence of finished events.

Question:
{\boxed{ponder\qquad discover\qquad take\qquad develop\qquad perform}}

A researcher (a) ———— a new hypothesis about immune response after observing unusual data. Months later the team (b) ———— a small but crucial pattern. It (c) ———— several years to fully develop the vaccine. During the final phase volunteers (d) ———— clinical trials.

Options:
ক. (a) তে কোন শব্দটি ব্যবহার করবেন?
খ. (b) তে কোন শব্দটি ব্যবহার করবেন?
গ. (c) তে কোন শব্দটি ব্যবহার করবেন?
ঘ. (d) তে কোন শব্দটি ব্যবহার করবেন?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক pondered
খ discovered
গ took
ঘ performed

Explanation:
ক: 'pondered' (past of 'ponder') conveys thoughtful consideration of the data that led to a hypothesis.\nখ: 'discovered' (past of 'discover') indicates the team found a crucial pattern — a discrete past event.\nগ: 'took' (past of 'take') fits the idiom 'took several years' to indicate the duration required to develop the vaccine.\nঘ: 'performed' (past of 'perform') is used for conducting clinical trials (performed the trials). The narrative is in past tense to describe a completed research timeline, so past forms of the verbs are correct.

Question:
Boxed verbs: {build\t\tmake\t\tlast\t\tmark\t\timprove}

At Kitty Hawk in December 1903 the Wright brothers (a)——— the first successful powered airplane. That first short flight (b)——— only a few seconds, but it (c)——— the beginning of modern powered flight. Over the next years they (d)——— the design and control systems of their machines.

Options:
ক. (a) ———
খ. (b) ———
গ. (c) ———
ঘ. (d) ———


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক built
খ lasted
গ marked
ঘ improved

Explanation:
ক (built): The event happened in the past, so the past tense 'built' is appropriate for constructing the first powered airplane.\nখ (lasted): The flight continued for a short duration, so 'lasted' (past tense) correctly describes how long it continued.\nগ (marked): The flight signified or established a milestone; 'marked' in past tense fits this sense.\nঘ (improved): Over subsequent years they made enhancements, so 'improved' (past tense) correctly describes their continued work. Each blank requires a past-tense verb because the paragraph describes historical events.

Question:
Many students today (a) — (not sleep) enough during examination periods. They (b) — (feel) exhausted in class and (c) — (find) it difficult to remember what they studied. A regular sleep schedule (d) — (improve) both attention and memory.

Options:
ক. (a) — (not sleep)
খ. (b) — (feel)
গ. (c) — (find)
ঘ. (d) — (improve)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক do not sleep;

খ feel;

গ find;

ঘ improves.

Explanation:
ক: "Many students" is a plural subject, so we use the simple present negative "do not sleep" to state a habitual action.

খ: With a plural subject we use the simple present affirmative "feel" to describe their current/general state.

গ: Again simple present "find" matches the plural subject and describes a recurring difficulty.

ঘ: "A regular sleep schedule" is a singular noun phrase, so the verb takes an -s in the simple present: "improves." This expresses a general truth about the effect of regular sleep.

Question:
A balanced diet (a) — (include) whole grains, proteins and fresh produce. Yet many people (b) — (ignore) nutritional advice and (c) — (eat) too many processed foods. Over weeks and months their immune systems (d) — (become) weaker.

Options:
ক. (a) — (include)
খ. (b) — (ignore)
গ. (c) — (eat)
ঘ. (d) — (become)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক includes;

খ ignore;

গ eat;

ঘ becomes.

Explanation:
ক: "A balanced diet" is singular, so the verb is "includes" in the simple present to state a general fact.

খ: "Many people" is plural; the simple present plural form is "ignore," indicating a habitual action.

গ: With the plural subject we use the simple present "eat" to describe their typical food choices.

ঘ: "Their immune systems" is plural in meaning but treated as a collective result for each person; however the clause refers to "their immune systems" becoming weaker over time — grammatically you can say "become" if you read it strictly plural, but here the intended singular effect phrased with a singular verb for each person's system yields "becomes." In standard usage describing a general result we say "becomes weaker."

Question:
Many city parks (a) — (be) neglected these days. Local residents (b) — (dump) garbage there and municipal services (c) — (not maintain) the grounds regularly. As a consequence, children (d) — (lose) safe places to play.

Options:
ক. (a) — (be)
খ. (b) — (dump)
গ. (c) — (not maintain)
ঘ. (d) — (lose)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক are neglected;

খ dump;

গ do not maintain;

ঘ lose.

Explanation:
ক: "Many city parks" is plural, so we use the passive plural form "are neglected" to express their current condition.

খ: With the plural subject "local residents" the simple present "dump" describes the recurring action of littering.

গ: "Municipal services" (plural) requires the negative simple present plural: "do not maintain." This shows a habitual lack of upkeep.

ঘ: "Children" (plural) use the simple present "lose" to state the resulting general consequence: they lose safe play areas when parks are neglected.

Solution:
ক সময়মতো পালন
খ নিয়মিততা/নিষ্ঠা
গ কমে যায়/প্রভাবিত হয়
ঘ অনিশ্চয়তা/বাধা সৃষ্টি করে

Explanation:
ক: বাক্যে বলা হয়েছে ‘অনেকে দিনের সূচি ঠিকভাবে পালন করে (a) _____ তাঁদের দায়িত্ব’। এখানে ক্রিয়া হিসেবে 'পালন করে' এর পরে যে নাম বা অবস্থা বসবে তা হবে 'তাঁদের দায়িত্ব' কাকে বোঝায়—এখানে প্রাসঙ্গিক শব্দ হলো 'সময়মতো পালন' বা সংক্ষেপে 'পালন'—তাই উপযুক্ত পূরণ 'সময়মতো পালন' বা কেবল 'পালন'।

খ: 'কর্মক্ষেত্রে সফল হতে হলে (b) _____ অত্যন্ত জরুরি' — সফলতার জন্য ধারাবাহিকতা ও অনুশাসন দরকার; তাই 'নিয়মিততা' বা 'নিষ্ঠা' (পাংক্তিতে উভয়ই গ্রহণযোগ্য) সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত।

গ: 'বিলম্ব করলে কাজের মান (c) _____' — বিলম্ব হলে কাজের মান পড়ে যায় বা প্রভাবিত হয়; তাই 'কমে যায়' বা 'প্রভাবিত হয়' অর্থগতভাবে সঠিক।

ঘ: 'দলগত কার্যক্রমে (d) _____ সমস্যা সৃষ্টি হয়' — দলগত কাজে সময়ানুবর্তিতার অভাব এলে অনিশ্চয়তা বা বাধা দেখা দেয়; তাই 'অনিশ্চয়তা' বা 'বাধা সৃষ্টি করে' উপযুক্ত।

সামগ্রিকভাবে প্রতিটি পূরণ বাক্যের সঙ্গত প্রেক্ষাপট ও ভাষাগত বাহ্যিকতা বিবেচনা করে নির্বাচিত।

ক. Blank (a) পূরণ করুন
খ. Blank (b) পূরণ করুন
গ. Blank (c) পূরণ করুন
ঘ. Blank (d) পূরণ করুন


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: represent
খ উত্তর: begin
গ উত্তর: embody
ঘ উত্তর: experiment

Explanation:
বিবরণ ও ব্যাখ্যা:
- ক (represent): এখানে বলা হচ্ছে তরুণ আহমেদ একটি স্মৃতি কেন্দ্রে জাতীয় সাহিত্যের সংগ্রামী চেতনা ও কারিগরির ঐতিহ্যকে একত্রিত করেছেন; অর্থাৎ তিনি ঐতিহ্য ও চেতনার 'প্রতিনিধিত্ব' করেছেন — তাই represent বেশি উপযুক্ত।
- খ (begin): বাক্যে 'যখন তিনি (b) — তার পরিকল্পনা নিয়ে কাজ করা শুরু করেন' অংশে 'শুরু করা' বোঝাতে ইংরেজিতে 'begin' বা 'start' ব্যবহার করা যায়; প্রদত্ত তালিকায় begin আছে, তাই এটি উপযুক্ত।
- গ (embody): বাক্যটি বলছে এটি কেবল একটি স্থাপনা নয় বরং মানুষের আবেগ ও ইতিহাসকে — (c) — ; এখানে 'অভিব্যক্ত করা/প্রতিফলিত করা'য়ের অর্থে 'embody' (সমাহিত করা, বহন করা) সবচেয়ে মানানসই।
- ঘ (experiment): বাক্যের শেষ অংশে 'তিনি (d) — বিভিন্ন পন্থা ব্যবহার করে...' — এখানে বিভিন্ন পন্থা 'পরীক্ষা করা/নতুন পদ্ধতি প্রয়োগ করা' বোঝাতে 'experiment' ব্যবহার ভালো করে; অন্য বিকল্পগুলো (employ, explore ইত্যাদি) থাকলেও প্রদত্ত তালিকায় experiment প্রাসঙ্গিক কারণ তিনি নতুন উপায়ে কাঁচামাল ও আকার পরীক্ষা করে দেখছেন।

Options:
ক. Blank (a) পূরণ করুন
খ. Blank (b) পূরণ করুন
গ. Blank (c) পূরণ করুন
ঘ. Blank (d) পূরণ করুন


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: synthesize
খ উত্তর: pursue
গ উত্তর: anchor
ঘ উত্তর: illuminate

Explanation:
বিস্তারিত কারণ:
- ক (synthesize): বাক্যে 'গ্রামীণ জীবনের সংগ্রাম ও আনন্দকে একত্র করে আধুনিক ভাষায় প্রকাশ' - একাধিক উপাদান মিশিয়ে নতুন whole বানানোর ধারণায় 'synthesize' (সংশ্লেষ করা) সঠিক।
- খ (pursue): তিনি 'এই কাজকে ... একটি পদ্ধতি হিসেবে' হিসেবে চালিয়ে যেতে চান—'পালন/অনুসরণ করা' বোঝাতে pursue উপযুক্ত।
- গ (anchor): বাক্যে 'স্থানীয় কাহিনীগুলোকে ... সামগ্রিক ঐতিহ্যের সঙ্গে (c) — করার জন্য' — 'আশ্রয়/নির্ভরতা' না, বরং 'বন্দী করা/স্থায়ীকরণ করা' অর্থে 'anchor' (নির্ধারণ করা, ভিত্তি স্থাপন করা) মানায়।
- ঘ (illuminate): 'প্রতিটি ভাসকে তিনি ... একটি কেন্দ্রীয় ভাবকে (d) — করেন' — এখানে 'উজ্জ্বল করা/প্রকাশ করা' অর্থে 'illuminate' (স্পষ্টতর করে তোলা) যথাযথ; দর্শকরা তাৎক্ষণিকভাবে কাহিনী অনুভব করবে এমনভাবে তিনি ভাবটি প্রকাশিত করেন।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: propose
খ উত্তর: integrate
গ উত্তর: convey
ঘ উত্তর: utilize

Explanation:
কারণ ব্যাখ্যা:
- ক (propose): 'নাগরিক দলটি একটি ঐতিহাসিক প্রজেক্ট (a) — করেছিল' — প্রজেক্ট 'প্রস্তাব করা' প্রেক্ষিতে 'propose' সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত; তারা পরিকল্পনা প্রস্তাব করেছিল।
- খ (integrate): 'প্রকল্পের পরিকল্পনাকারীরা (b) — যে পার্কটি স্থানটিকে পুনরুজ্জীবিত করবে, একই সঙ্গে ঐতিহাসিক কাহিনীকে (c) —' — এখানে পার্কটি বিভিন্ন উপাদান একত্রিত করে পুনরুজ্জীবিত করবে বোঝাতে 'integrate' মানায়।
- গ (convey): ইতিহাসকে 'প্রকাশ করা/প্রেরণ করা' অর্থে 'convey' (বক্তব্য/ভাব পৌঁছে দেওয়া) সঠিক।
- ঘ (utilize): 'তারা সিদ্ধান্ত নেয় ... ডিজাইনটি (d) — করার জন্য' — স্থানীয় শিল্পকর্ম ও বয়োজ্যেষ্ঠদের কথা রেখে ডিজাইনকে বাস্তবায়ন বা কাজে লাগাতে 'utilize' (ব্যবহার করা) উপযুক্ত; বিকল্প হিসেবে 'employ' থাকলে তা হতেও পারে, কিন্তু প্রদত্ত তালিকায় utilize দেয়া আছে।

Question:
A small-town music festival brings the community together every year. Volunteers prepare food stalls, craft booths and a programme of performances. In the festival brochure the organizers gave the following notes: (ক) the festival (ক) — (organize) by local volunteers every summer; (খ) small bands and solo artists (খ) — (perform) on two outdoor stages; (গ) the relaxed atmosphere (গ) — (enjoy) by families and visitors alike; (ঘ) the event (ঘ) — (last) from mid-morning until late evening with short breaks between acts.

Options:
ক. the festival — (organize) by local volunteers every summer.
খ. small bands and solo artists — (perform) on two outdoor stages.
গ. the relaxed atmosphere — (enjoy) by families and visitors alike.
ঘ. the event — (last) from mid-morning until late evening with short breaks between acts.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক is organized. খ perform. গ is enjoyed. ঘ lasts.

Explanation:
ক — 'is organized' (passive voice, present simple) is correct because the festival is a recurring event arranged by volunteers; passive highlights the action being done to the festival. খ — 'perform' (present simple) is suitable for regular scheduled actions by bands and artists. গ — 'is enjoyed' (passive, present simple) fits because the atmosphere is something experienced by people; passive focuses on the atmosphere being enjoyed. ঘ — 'lasts' (present simple) describes the regular duration of the event; use 'lasts' for a habitual/time-table type statement.

Options:
ক. this exhibition — (arrange) by the science department every November.
খ. students' projects and demonstrations — (show) in the main hall and classrooms.
গ. the fair — (attract) parents, alumni and local scientists.
ঘ. judges — (judge) the projects on creativity, scientific method and presentation.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক is arranged. খ are shown. গ attracts. ঘ judge.

Explanation:
ক — 'is arranged' (passive, present simple) indicates the school department regularly organizes the exhibition. খ — 'are shown' (passive, present simple plural) is appropriate because 'projects and demonstrations' (plural) are displayed to visitors. গ — 'attracts' (present simple singular) agrees with the singular noun 'fair' and describes a habitual effect. ঘ — 'judge' (present simple plural) matches the plural subject 'judges' and states their routine action; alternatively 'are judged' would change focus to the projects rather than the judges, but here the sentence focuses on the judges' activity.

Options:
ক. tomorrow's friendly match — (be) scheduled to start at ten o'clock.
খ. the visiting team — (bat) first according to the toss result.
গ. fast bowlers — (take) early wickets on the grassy pitch.
ঘ. if rain interrupts play the match — (end) earlier than planned or be continued on a reserve day.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক is scheduled. খ will bat. গ take. ঘ may end / might end (or 'will end' in certain contexts).

Explanation:
ক — 'is scheduled' (present simple passive) fits typical fixture language: the match is set to start at a specific time. খ — 'will bat' (future simple) is appropriate because 'according to the toss result' refers to a future plan determined by an event; 'will bat' expresses the expected action after the toss. Alternatively, 'are to bat' could be used in formal timetables. গ — 'take' (present simple) describes a common/likely outcome on that pitch; present simple is used for regular truths or general statements. ঘ — 'may end' or 'might end' expresses possibility when rain interrupts; 'will end' states a definite outcome but is less cautious. Use modal verbs to convey uncertainty about weather disruptions.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক increase

খ aggravate

গ result in

ঘ reduce

Explanation:
ক (increase): The context asks for a verb that means to make the concentration higher; 'increase' fits naturally: 'increase the concentration of airborne particles.'

খ (aggravate): Pollution makes respiratory symptoms worse. 'Aggravate' means to worsen, so 'aggravate coughing and wheezing' is appropriate.

গ (result in): Frequent clinic visits are a consequence of worsened symptoms. 'Result in' expresses that consequence: 'aggravate ... and sometimes result in frequent visits.'

ঘ (reduce): Public measures aim to lower exposure. 'Reduce' correctly conveys the intended decrease in exposure to pollutants. Each chosen word matches both meaning and grammatical fit in the sentence.

গ (lead to): 'Lead to cirrhosis' indicates a causal progression over time — drinking can result in cirrhosis.

ঘ (cause): In the last clause, 'may even cause organ failure or death' uses 'cause' to express the direct harmful outcome. Each selection fits semantically and syntactically into the sentence.

ক. Fill (a)
খ. Fill (b)
গ. Fill (c)
ঘ. Fill (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: arrive

খ Answer: cope

গ Answer: settling

ঘ Answer: explore

Explanation:
ক (a) 'arrive' is the correct choice because the sentence indicates a past event that happened two weeks ago: "I (a)——— two weeks ago." The simple past 'arrived' would also fit in normal speech, but with the given base-form choices, 'arrive' is intended. (If the test required a past form, 'arrived' would be used.)

খ (b) The verb 'cope' (to manage or deal with) correctly completes "I couldn't (b)——— with the weather..." meaning inability to deal with it. Other verbs in the list like 'get' or 'settle' don't convey the immediate difficulty as well.

গ (c) 'settling' (present participle) fits: "I'm slowly settling in." This is the natural progressive form to show an ongoing process of becoming comfortable. Using 'settle' without '-ing' would be ungrammatical here.

ঘ (d) 'explore' fits "There is so much to explore around the town" — the infinitive after 'to' expresses purpose/possibility. Other verbs like 'admire' or 'miss' would change the meaning; 'explore' best matches discovering streets and stories.

Question:
Hi Samir,

Choose words from the box: {start, manage, learn, enjoy, meet, feel}

I began my internship last month and it's quite different from university life. I (a)——— on my first day with a brief orientation. After a few weeks I had to (b)——— several tasks at once, but my supervisor helped me. I'm hoping to (c)——— as much as possible from each project. Surprisingly, I (d)——— the fast pace; it keeps me motivated. I also got to (e)——— professionals from other departments, which was exciting.


Options:
ক. Fill (a)
খ. Fill (b)
গ. Fill (c)
ঘ. Fill (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: start

খ Answer: manage

গ Answer: learn

ঘ Answer: enjoy

Explanation:
ক (a) 'start' completes "I (a)——— on my first day with a brief orientation." The simple past 'started' would be natural; given the choice list, 'start' indicates the action that began the internship.

খ (b) 'manage' fits: "I had to manage several tasks at once" — 'manage' means to handle or cope with multiple responsibilities. 'Learn' wouldn't make sense here because the focus is on handling tasks.

গ (c) 'learn' completes "I'm hoping to learn as much as possible from each project." This expresses the intern's goal of gaining knowledge or skills.

ঘ (d) 'enjoy' works for "I (d)——— the fast pace; it keeps me motivated." 'Enjoy' indicates a positive reaction to the fast tempo. Alternatives like 'feel' are possible but less precise about liking the pace.

Question:
Dear Anika,

Pick words from: {have, be, discover, take, remember, miss}

Volunteering at the coastal clinic has been eye-opening. I (a)——— the chance to work with children and their parents. The routine can (b)——— long days but the team spirit keeps us going. Every week we (c)——— small new things about public health in the region. I will always (d)——— the warm smiles of the locals who welcomed us.


Options:
ক. Fill (a)
খ. Fill (b)
গ. Fill (c)
ঘ. Fill (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: have

খ Answer: involve

গ Answer: discover

ঘ Answer: remember

Explanation:
ক (a) 'have' fits "I (a)——— the chance to work..." — 'have the chance' is a common collocation meaning 'was given the opportunity.'

খ (b) The intended meaning is that the routine can make days long or cause long days, but from the given word list 'be' or 'take' might be expected. A natural completion is 'involve' (not in the box) but using the box words, 'take' can work: "The routine can take long days" is slightly awkward. A better phrasing is "The routine can involve long days"; since the instruction allowed only listed words, if 'involve' is allowed we choose it. If strictly using the box, choose 'take' meaning 'require' — "The routine can take long days" (understandable).

গ (c) 'discover' completes "Every week we discover small new things about public health..." meaning they learn new facts or observations.

ঘ (d) 'remember' fits "I will always remember the warm smiles..." — it indicates a lasting memory of the locals' kindness.

Note: Some sentences require the correct tense/verb form in natural English (e.g., 'started', 'settled', 'enjoyed'). The answers above pick the base forms given in the word banks; in actual completion students may need to inflect verbs appropriately (past tense or -ing forms) to fit grammar.

Question:
By the time aid workers arrived at the makeshift camp, Mira's family had already been through a long ordeal. By then, Mira (a) — (reach) the camp after a difficult journey. Her elder brother (b) — (injure) during the travel, so they (c) — (treat) at the medical tent. Mira soon (d) — (begin) learning letters from a volunteer teacher who stayed in the camp.

Options:
ক. (a) — (reach)
খ. (b) — (injure)
গ. (c) — (treat)
ঘ. (d) — (begin)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক had reached
খ had been injured
গ were treated
ঘ began

Explanation:
ক (had reached): The phrase "By the time aid workers arrived" sets a reference point in the past. Mira's arrival happened before that moment, so the past perfect "had reached" correctly shows the earlier action.

খ (had been injured): The brother's injury occurred during the journey, prior to arrival and prior to being treated. Passive past perfect "had been injured" indicates the injury happened earlier than the arrival/treatment.

গ (were treated): Treatment at the medical tent is a past action occurring at the time of arrival; the passive simple past "were treated" is appropriate because the subjects (they) received the action.

ঘ (began): Learning started after arrival and treatment; simple past "began" describes that subsequent past action. "Began learning" is the natural collocation here (or "started learning").

A thin stray dog kept hanging around the corner bakery for several weeks. One crisp morning, the baker Sam (a) — (notice) the dog watching the shop, so he (b) — (feed) it with leftover rolls. Over the next few days the dog (c) — (grow) attached to Sam’s small kitchen and finally (d) — (adopt) by him.

Options:
ক. (a) — (notice)
খ. (b) — (feed)
গ. (c) — (grow)
ঘ. (d) — (adopt)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক noticed
খ fed
গ grew
ঘ was adopted

Explanation:
ক (noticed): The narrative reports a past event "One crisp morning," so simple past "noticed" is correct for Sam becoming aware of the dog.

খ (fed): The action of giving leftover rolls happened right after he noticed the dog; simple past "fed" describes that completed action.

গ (grew): "Grow attached" (become emotionally attached over time) in past simple — "grew attached" — fits a gradual past change across days.

ঘ (was adopted): The dog is the subject who receives the action of adoption; passive simple past "was adopted" correctly expresses that Sam adopted the dog.

When the master finally retired, Rafi (b) — (take) charge of the workshop. He (c) — (maintain) the high standard of craftsmanship, and local customers (d) — (praise) his dedication and the quality of the furniture.

Options:
ক. (a) — (learn)
খ. (b) — (take)
গ. (c) — (maintain)
ঘ. (d) — (praise)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক had learned
খ took
গ maintained
ঘ praised

Explanation:
ক (had learned): Learning occurred over many years prior to the moment when the master retired, so past perfect "had learned" emphasizes that these skills were acquired before Rafi assumed leadership.

খ (took): The master retired (past), and Rafi then assumed responsibility; simple past "took" describes that punctual past event.

গ (maintained): Keeping quality high is an ongoing past action after taking charge; simple past "maintained" is adequate for describing his consistent effort in that period.

ঘ (praised): Customers expressed approval in the past; simple past "praised" succinctly records their reaction.

Question:
Words in the box: {desire, achieve, seldom, is, must, dare}

Fill the blanks in the passage below using the words above.

Everyone (a) — success in life, but very few can (b) — it. One reason for this is that many people (c) — take risks. We must remember that life (d) — a smooth path; it demands effort.

Options:
ক. Choose the correct word for blank (a).
খ. Choose the correct word for blank (b).
গ. Choose the correct word for blank (c).
ঘ. Choose the correct word for blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক desire
খ achieve
গ seldom
ঘ is

Explanation:
ক (blank a): "Everyone desire(s) success" — the noun "desire" (used as the verb 'desire') fits the meaning; grammatically the sentence implies everyone wants or desires success. খ (blank b): "achieve" is the correct verb meaning 'to get or reach (success)', so 'very few can achieve it' is appropriate. গ (blank c): "seldom" means 'rarely' and correctly conveys that few people take risks; 'seldom take risks' fits the sentence's sense. ঘ (blank d): "is" completes the copular structure 'life is a smooth path' (negated by the previous clause); 'is' is the correct linking verb here. Each chosen word matches both meaning and grammatical form required by the surrounding sentence.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক want
খ realize
গ often
ঘ isn't

Explanation:
ক (blank a): "want" correctly expresses desire: 'Most people want to make a difference.' খ (blank b): "realize" means 'turn into reality' and fits: 'only a small number realize that change' (i.e., achieve it). গ (blank c): "often" conveys frequency and fits idiomatically: 'Too many people often stop at the first setback.' Alternatively 'often' emphasizes that this happens frequently. ঘ (blank d): "isn't" (is not) correctly negates the adjective 'always easy' forming 'the road isn't always easy.' Each word was chosen to preserve meaning and grammatical agreement with the rest of the sentence.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক aspire
খ attain
গ rarely
ঘ will

Explanation:
ক (blank a): "aspire" means 'to have a strong desire to achieve something' and fits: 'Young people aspire to build meaningful careers.' খ (blank b): "attain" means 'to reach or achieve (a goal)' so 'manage to attain their highest goals' is correct. গ (blank c): "rarely" (synonymous with 'seldom') accurately conveys that many do not show courage often: 'Many rarely show the required courage at the first obstacle.' ঘ (blank d): "will" indicates future tendency or outcome: 'Success will be for those who prepare and persist' — here 'will' links the condition to the outcome. Each choice matches the semantic needs and grammatical form of its blank.

Question:
A young student's daily routine is described: If a boy (a) — (spend) his evenings on constructive activities, he (b) — (gain) both knowledge and confidence. Those who (c) — (waste) their time on useless habits soon (d) — (find) themselves lagging behind.

Options:
ক. (a) — (spend)
খ. (b) — (gain)
গ. (c) — (waste)
ঘ. (d) — (find)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক spends
খ will gain
গ waste
ঘ find

Explanation:
ক (spends): The sentence begins with a conditional clause of habit/possibility: 'If a boy spends his evenings...' For a third-person singular subject 'a boy' the simple present form takes -s -> 'spends'.

খ (will gain): In a real conditional (If + present ...), the result clause that refers to a future consequence normally uses 'will' + base verb: 'he will gain both knowledge and confidence.' Using 'gains' would also be grammatically possible to express habitual result, but 'will gain' emphasizes the future/likely outcome.

গ (waste): 'Those who' refers to a plural subject 'those', so the simple present base form is used without -s: 'Those who waste their time...'

ঘ (find): After 'Those who waste their time' the sentence describes the typical consequence; in simple present narrative we say 'soon find themselves lagging behind.' Using 'find' (simple present plural) matches the plural subject 'those'. If we wanted to stress future consequence, 'will find' would be acceptable, but 'find' is natural for general truths/habits.

Question:
Community garden notice: When neighbors (a) — (come) together to plant trees, the locality (b) — (become) greener. If people (c) — (not water) the saplings, they (d) — (die).

Options:
ক. (a) — (come)
খ. (b) — (become)
গ. (c) — (not water)
ঘ. (d) — (die)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক come
খ becomes
গ do not/don't water
ঘ will die

Explanation:
ক (come): 'When neighbors come together...' — 'neighbors' is plural, so use the base form 'come' in the present simple for a temporal clause.

খ (becomes): 'the locality becomes greener' — 'locality' is singular, so the present simple third-person singular form is 'becomes'. This describes the regular or general effect of neighbors planting trees.

গ (do not/don't water): In the conditional negative clause 'If people do not water the saplings...' we use the auxiliary 'do' for the negative in present simple with plural subject 'people'. 'Don't' is an acceptable contraction.

ঘ (will die): The result clause refers to a likely future consequence of neglect: 'they will die.' In first conditional structure (If + present, ... will + base) 'will die' is the natural choice. Using 'die' (present simple) could indicate a general truth but 'will die' stresses the consequence.

Health advice note: Unless we (a) — (take) care of our diet, we (b) — (suffer) from illnesses. Regular exercise (c) — (help) to maintain strength and (d) — (improve) mood.

Options:
ক. (a) — (take)
খ. (b) — (suffer)
গ. (c) — (help)
ঘ. (d) — (improve)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক take
খ will suffer
গ helps
ঘ improves

Explanation:
ক (take): 'Unless we take care of our diet...' — 'unless' functions like a negative conditional. For present/future general advice we use the present simple in the clause: 'take'.

খ (will suffer): The main clause describes the probable future consequence, so 'we will suffer from illnesses.' In a first conditional sense (If/unless + present → will + base) 'will suffer' is appropriate.

গ (helps): 'Regular exercise helps to maintain strength...' — 'regular exercise' is treated as a singular activity, so third-person singular present 'helps' is used.

ঘ (improves): 'and improves mood.' Again third-person singular present 'improves' matches the singular subject 'regular exercise' and expresses a general truth about its effect.

Correct Answer:

Explanation:
ক (carried out): The verb 'carry out' fits with 'hundreds of experiments' — Edison performed or carried out many experiments. খ (discouraged): Context shows repeated failures causing a loss of hope, so 'discouraged' is the correct adjective. গ (alone): The phrase 'sat ___ in his small workshop' is best completed by 'alone' to indicate solitude and reflection. ঘ (inspired): The glowing filament renewed his motivation; 'inspired' correctly conveys that it moved him to continue. Each choice is dictated by lexical collocation and the overall narrative of persistence despite failure.

ক (refused): Critics 'refused' his collection in the sense that they rejected or dismissed it. খ (mend): Here 'mend his brushes' is an idiomatic way to say he considered tidying up or giving up tools — 'mend' (repair) fits the image of putting things away as if retiring. গ (examine): 'decided to examine an old sketchbook' is grammatically and semantically appropriate: he looks through it. ঘ (heartened): The innocent sketch restores his courage — 'heartened' means encouraged and is the best fit. The narrative requires words that reflect rejection, retreat, investigation, and renewed courage, respectively.

Explanation:
ক (nurtured): 'Nurture' implies sustained care and feeding, ideal for saplings needing constant attention. খ (despair): The neighbors lost hope during the drought, so 'despair' correctly captures their emotional state. গ (withstood): The phrase 'life had withstood the hard spell' means the plant endured the difficult conditions; 'withstood' conveys survival against adversity. ঘ (encouraged): Seeing the new leaf motivated others to help; 'encouraged' best expresses that positive influence. Each word choice matches the gardener's perseverance theme and the cause-effect sequence in the passage.

Explanation:
ক (are): 'Rivers' is a plural subject, so the simple present linking verb 'are' correctly completes 'Rivers are vital...'. খ (provide): 'provide' is the correct transitive verb meaning 'supply' — rivers provide water, transport routes and fish. গ (become polluted): we need a passive/resultative phrase showing that rivers get into a harmful state; 'become polluted' (or 'get polluted') correctly expresses that rivers are turned dirty by waste. ঘ (pollute): the people perform the action, so the active verb 'pollute' (meaning 'make dirty/contaminated') fits: people pollute rivers by dumping waste.

ঘ. Fill blank (d): choose the verb that completes the warning about extinction.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক provide
খ hunt
গ protect
ঘ disappear

Explanation:
ক (provide): 'Provide' is the appropriate transitive verb: habitats provide food, shelter and breeding grounds. খ (hunt): 'Hunt' accurately describes poachers' action of pursuing and killing wildlife for profit. গ (protect): to save species we must protect them and their habitats; 'protect' is the natural verb here. ঘ (disappear): in this context 'disappear' is a clear, simple verb meaning 'cease to exist' — a direct and natural way to warn that species will disappear (become extinct) if not protected.
