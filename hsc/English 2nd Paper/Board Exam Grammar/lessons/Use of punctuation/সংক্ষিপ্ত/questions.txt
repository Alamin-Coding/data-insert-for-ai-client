Question:
how is your father rana said mr karim he is very well thank you replied rana i am glad to hear that he is in good heath said mr karim.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer uses quotation marks, capitalization, and punctuation to separate speech from reporting clauses: questions take a question mark, replies usually use a comma before the reporting verb, and spelling should be corrected to "health." Thus the properly punctuated dialogue is: "How is your father, Rana?" said Mr Karim. "He is very well, thank you," replied Rana. "I am glad to hear that; he is in good health," said Mr Karim.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Mr. Karim asked, "How is your father, Rana?" Rana replied, "He is very well, thank you." Mr. Karim said, "I am glad to hear that he is in good health."  
This is correct because direct speech puts each speaker’s exact words inside quotation marks with proper punctuation (a question mark after the question, commas or periods for replies) and places the reporting verb (asked/replied/said) outside the quotes.
