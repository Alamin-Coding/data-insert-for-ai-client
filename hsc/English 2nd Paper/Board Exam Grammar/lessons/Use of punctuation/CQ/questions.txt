Question:
Aryan : Do you read newspaper regularly Farhan.

Farhan : Yes, I do. What’s about you?

Aryan : To tell you frankly I do not read newspaper regularly.

Farhan : Why you get enough time during the break in the college.

Aryan : Yes, I do get but I do not like. Moreover I think it is a wastage of time.

Farhan : Remember newspaper is called the ‘storehouse’ of knowledge. The more you will read newspaper the more you will learn.

Aryan : Then, from today, I will start reading newspaper

Farhan : Yes, that’s like a good friend.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Aryan : Do you read newspaper regularly, Farhan?

Farhan : Yes, I do. What's about you?

Aryan : To tell you frankly, I do not read newspaper regularly.

Farhan : Why? You get enough time during the break in the college.

Aryan : Yes, I do get but I do not like. Moreover, I think it is a wastage of time.

Farhan : Remember, newspaper is called the 'storehouse' of knowledge. The more you will read newspaper, the more you will learn.

Aryan : Then, from today, I will start reading newspaper.

Farhan : Yes, that's like a good friend.

Explanation:
The correct answer is that Aryan will start reading the newspaper because Farhan persuaded him. Farhan called the newspaper a “storehouse of knowledge” and explained that the more one reads the more one learns, which changed Aryan’s opinion. This shows how giving a clear benefit can convince someone to form a new habit.

Question:
“I’m not in the least hungry.” my guest sighed “but if you insist I don’t mind having some asparagus.”

I ordered them.

“Aren’t you going to have any”

“No I never eat asparagus.” “I know there are people who don’t like them. The fact is you ruin your palate by all the meat you eat.

“Coffee” I said

“Yes, just an ice-cream and coffee” she answered.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"I'm not in the least hungry," my guest sighed. "but if you insist I don't mind having some asparagus."

I ordered them.

"Aren't you going to have any?"

"No, I never eat asparagus.'

"I know there are people who don't like them. The fact is, you ruin your palate by all the meat you eat."

"Coffee". I said.

"Yes, just an ice-cream and coffee," she answered.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer is that the guest ultimately refuses the asparagus because she never eats them, despite her earlier polite remark that she "doesn't mind" — her later statement clarifies her true choice. The host’s comment about ruined palates explains a possible reason (eating lots of meat makes delicate asparagus taste unpleasant), showing how dialogue can contain a polite hedge followed by a clear refusal.

Explanation:
The principal’s reply is correct because formal school matters (like a study tour) require a written application so he can officially review, approve, and keep a record. This exchange teaches polite, procedural communication: the student asks permission respectfully and the principal gives consent while directing the proper next step.

Question:
Tourist: How old is the edifice guide

Guide : Madame its a 15th century edifice

Tourist : What a wonderful edifice it is

Guide : It was built by Akbar the emperor of India.

Tourist : Oh! I see

Guide : Madame we should move now. The sun is about to set. It would be dark

Tourist : Isnt the place safe?

Guide : It is. But the security does not allow anybody after the sunset

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The guide’s statements are inconsistent because a "15th century" building dates from 1401–1500, while Emperor Akbar lived and ruled in the 16th century (born 1542, reigned 1556–1605), so he could not have built a 15th‑century edifice. Therefore either the century or the builder given by the guide is incorrect.

Question:
Arif : Hello How are you Zakia?

Zakia : Fine. What about you

Arif : Well I was a bit sick

Zakia : Really What happened

Arif : Stomach upset. I had outside food. It troubles my stomach.

Zakia : That’s why I always try to avoid outside food they are unhygienic.

Arif : I’m not going to have it anymore.

Zakia : Anyway you take care bye.

Arif : Bye.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer is that Arif’s stomach upset was caused by eating outside food. Arif explicitly says the outside food “troubles my stomach,” and Zakia’s remark about unhygienic outside food explains the cause-and-effect idea that unsafe food can lead to stomach problems, so avoiding it is sensible.

Arafat : Yes there is a bus stop at the corner

Nazmul : Thank you

Arafat : Dont mention it

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The correct answer is “Yes, there is a bus stop at the corner” because Arafat directly tells Nazmul that in response to his question. This teaches that in dialogues you find answers by noting the speaker’s explicit statements about location and transport options.

Question:
Husband: Cant you cook food properly

Wife: I cook food properly the problem is with you

Husband: Really these foods are crap they taste pathetic.

Wife: I spend time in the kitchen from morning till afternoon. I work hard. I take care of two children at home. What do you do?

Husband: I work hard and earn money that you spend lavishly.

Wife: How dare you say that

Husband: Well that is the truth

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The husband complains about the food but the wife deflects by listing her efforts, and the husband replies with a counter-accusation about money; thus the correct interpretation is that both are avoiding the actual issue and escalating the argument instead of addressing the specific complaint. This illustrates deflection and blame-shifting in conflicts — effective communication requires giving specific, constructive feedback and focusing on solutions rather than personal attacks.

Question:
“Good morning where are you going” said the merchant. I was just coming to see you said the youth. “What do you want” “Please help me to earn my bread by the labour of my hands. “Do you really want work!” said the merchant. Yes if you have any.” “Then follow me and carry the box from the shop to my house.” “By Allah I’m really grateful to you,” said the youth.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
“Good morning, where are you going?” said the merchant. “I was just coming to see you,” said the youth. “What do you want?” “Please help me to earn my bread by the labour of my hands.” “Do you really want work!” said the merchant. “Yes, if you have any.” “Then follow me and carry the box from the shop to my house.” “By Allah, I’m really grateful to you,” said the youth.

Explanation:
The answer is correct because the merchant explicitly offers work when he says, “Then follow me and carry the box from the shop to my house,” so the youth’s job is clearly to carry the box. For comprehension, always look for direct statements in the dialogue that name the task or request and identify who says it and what action they ask for.

A: Why is it called green energy

B: Well its green energy because it helps us keep the earth green I mean it doesnt emit any pollutant in the atmosphere when we produce and use it.

A: I see then it must be a clear source of energy.

B: Exactly. And thats why its called clean energy.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A:   What’s  solar energy?

B:  It’s  one of the renewable energy sources.

A: Why is it called green  energy?

B:  Well, it’s  green energy because it helps us keep the earth  green.  I mean it  doesn’t  emit any pollutant in the atmosphere when we produce and use it.

A: I  see , then it must be a clear source of energy.

B: Exactly. And  that’s  why  it’s  called clean energy.

Explanation:
Solar energy is called green and clean because it comes from the sun (a renewable source) and generating power from sunlight does not release air pollutants or large amounts of CO2 like burning fossil fuels. By replacing fossil fuels, solar power reduces greenhouse gas emissions and helps keep the environment and air cleaner.

Question:
how is your father rana said mr karim he is very well thank you replied rana i am glad to hear that he is in good health said mr abdul karim

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"How is your father, Rana?" said Mr Karim. "He is very well. Thank you." replied Rana. "I am glad to hear that he is in good health," said Mr Karim.

Explanation:
Because these are examples of direct speech, each speaker’s exact words must be enclosed in quotation marks and properly punctuated: a question takes a question mark inside the quotes ("How is your father, Rana?"), and statements use a comma before the reporting verb ("He is very well, thank you," replied Rana). Capitalize the first word inside the quotes and place the reporting clause (said/replied) outside the quotation to show who is speaking.

Myself : Good morning. Rana. How are you?

Rana : I am so so. And you?

Myself : I am well. But why aren't you completely well?

Rana : In every examination I'm cutting a sorry figure.

Myself : What's the reason? Don't you utilize your time properly?

Rana : I spend most of the time in watching TV.

Rana : I don't feel bored in watching TV.

Myself : But as a student, you should study more and more.

Rana : Thank you for your good advice.

Explanation:
The correct answer is that Rana does poorly because he spends most of his time watching TV. Excessive TV watching reduces the time and focus available for studying, which directly lowers exam performance. Good time management and balancing recreation with regular study help improve results.

Question:
Entering the study room my elder brother looked around and burst out in disgust How dirty you have made the room! Why do you use it if you cant keep it tidy

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Entering the study, my elder brother looked around and burst out in disgust, "How dirty you have made the room! Why do you use it if you can't keep it tidy?"

I said, "I am extremely sorry. I have been a nuisance. In future you'll never see the room in such a bad condition. I promise."

Explanation:
The correct answer follows reported-speech rules: direct exclamation and question are turned into statements, pronouns shift from "you" to "I", and tenses backshift (present perfect "have made" → past perfect "had made", "can't" → "couldn't"). So the speech becomes: My elder brother entered the study room, looked around and burst out in disgust that I had made the room so dirty and asked why I used it if I couldn't keep it tidy. These changes are required when reporting someone’s words in the past.

Solution:
Son : Did you keep a diary during the liberation war?

Father : Yes, I did.

Son : Can I have a look at it?

Father : I'm afraid, I've lost it.

Son : Can you remember anything about it?

Father : Yes. I remember one event. There were lots of sounds and bangs outside one night. You wanted to look out but we didn't let you.

Son : Why?

Father : Because it was very dangerous. You were only four years old then.

Son : I can't remember anything.

Father : It's natural. No one can remember all from early childhood.

Explanation:
The father’s answer is correct because most people cannot form lasting episodic memories from very early childhood—a phenomenon called childhood (or infantile) amnesia. Memory encoding and retention depend on brain development and language skills, so events from when the son was about four often aren’t remembered later even though the father can recall them.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Tourist : How old is the edifice, guide?

Gulde : Madame, It's a 15th century edifice.

Tourist : What a wonderful edifice it is!

Guide : It was built by Akbar, the then emperor of India.

Tourist : Oh! I see.

Guide : Madame, we should move now. The sun is about to set. It would be dark soon.

Tourist : Isn't the place safe?

Guide : It is. But the security does not allow anybody after sunset.

Explanation:
Because the guide says it is a "15th century" edifice, the correct answer is that it was built in the 15th century (i.e., between [math]1401–1500[/math] AD). Centuries are numbered so the 15th century covers those years, making the building roughly [math]500–600\text{ years}[/math] old.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer is Farhan because he explicitly says, "Remember newspaper is called the ‘storehouse’ of knowledge," showing he values newspapers as a source of learning. This line explains the idea that reading newspapers increases knowledge and is why he persuades Aryan to start reading.

Father : Because it was very dangerous. You were only four years old then.

Son : I can't remember anything.

Father : It's natural. No one can remember all from early childhood.

Explanation:
The father's answer is correct because of infantile amnesia: children younger than about four rarely form durable autobiographical memories. The brain structures and language/self-awareness needed to encode and retain long-term personal memories mature later, so the son naturally cannot recall that night even though the father remembers it.

I said, "I am extremely sorry. I have been a nuisance. In future you'll never see the room in such a bad condition. I promise."

Explanation:
When reporting this speech, tense and form change: "have made" (present perfect) becomes "had made" (past perfect), "do you use" (present) becomes "did you use" (past), and "can't" becomes "couldn't." Also change the question word order to a statement and remove quotation marks. So it is reported as: He entered the study room, looked around and burst out in disgust that I had made the room very dirty and asked why I used it if I couldn't keep it tidy.

Rana’s poor exam performance is because he spends most of his time watching TV instead of studying, so he lacks sufficient preparation and practice. Recreation in moderation is fine, but excessive TV reduces study time and focus, which explains why he “cuts a sorry figure” in exams.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"How is your father, Rana?" said Mr Karim. "He is very well. Thank you." replied Rana. "I am glad to hear that he is in good health," said Mr Karim.

Explanation:
The correct form puts each spoken sentence in quotation marks and uses proper capitalization and punctuation. For example: Mr. Karim asked Rana, "How is your father?" Rana replied, "He is very well, thank you." Mr. Abdul Karim said, "I am glad to hear that he is in good health." This is right because reporting clauses (said/replied) stay outside the quotes, the first word inside quotes is capitalized, and commas/question marks belong inside the quotation marks.

Solution:
“Good morning, where are you going?” said the merchant. “I was just coming to see you,” said the youth. “What do you want?” “Please help me to earn my bread by the labour of my hands.” “Do you really want work!” said the merchant. “Yes, if you have any.” “Then follow me and carry the box from the shop to my house.” “By Allah, I’m really grateful to you,” said the youth.

Explanation:
When reporting the dialogue, we backshift present tenses to past, change pronouns and convert questions into indirect questions (e.g., “Where are you going?” → he asked where I/he was going). The merchant’s offers and the youth’s replies are therefore reported with past reporting verbs and adjusted pronouns — for example, “Do you really want work?” becomes the merchant asking if he really wanted work, and “By Allah I’m really grateful to you” becomes the youth saying that he was very grateful. These changes keep the original meaning while following the rules of indirect speech.

Question:
Husband: Cant you cook food properly

Wife: I cook food properly the problem is with you

Husband: Really these foods are crap they taste pathetic.

Wife: I spend time in the kitchen from morning till afternoon. I work hard. I take care of two children at home. What do you do?

Husband: I work hard and earn money that you spend lavishly.

Wife: How dare you say that

Husband: Well that is the truth

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
This dialogue illustrates an escalating argument where the husband criticizes the wife’s cooking and the wife responds defensively by listing her efforts; neither addresses the specific complaint. Both parties shift to blaming (housework vs. money), showing a breakdown in constructive communication—classic defensiveness and contempt. The correct interpretation is that the exchange is about blame-shifting and poor communication, not about solving the cooking issue.

Question:
Arif : Hello How are you Zakia?

Zakia : Fine. What about you

Arif : Well I was a bit sick

Zakia : Really What happened

Arif : Stomach upset. I had outside food. It troubles my stomach.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:

Question:
Tourist: How old is the edifice guide

Guide : Madame its a 15th century edifice

Tourist : What a wonderful edifice it is

Guide : It was built by Akbar the emperor of India.

Tourist : Oh! I see

Guide : Madame we should move now. The sun is about to set. It would be dark

Tourist : Isnt the place safe?

Guide : It is. But the security does not allow anybody after the sunset

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
The guide’s statements contradict: calling it a 15th-century edifice means it dates from the 1400s, while Emperor Akbar lived and ruled in the 16th century (mid-1500s). Therefore the building cannot both be from the 15th century and have been built by Akbar.

Question:
“I’m not in the least hungry.” my guest sighed “but if you insist I don’t mind having some asparagus.”

I ordered them.

“Aren’t you going to have any”

“No I never eat asparagus.” “I know there are people who don’t like them. The fact is you ruin your palate by all the meat you eat.

“Coffee” I said

“Yes, just an ice-cream and coffee” she answered.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
"I'm not in the least hungry," my guest sighed. "but if you insist I don't mind having some asparagus."

I ordered them.

"Aren't you going to have any?"

"No, I never eat asparagus.'

"I know there are people who don't like them. The fact is, you ruin your palate by all the meat you eat."

"Coffee". I said.

"Yes, just an ice-cream and coffee," she answered.

Explanation:
Explanation: The guest clearly says she is "not in the least hungry" but agrees to "some asparagus" when pressed, and later asks only for "an ice-cream and coffee," so she refuses a full meal but accepts a light dish and dessert. The comment about ruining one's palate by eating meat explains why she avoids asparagus: strong-flavored meat dulls the taste for delicate vegetables.

Question:
"Morning, stranger," called the craftsman from his doorway. A lanky youth answered, "I beg leave to work; I can mend baskets and carry water. I only ask a fair wage for my labor." The craftsman nodded, "If you truly wish to earn, help me mend three baskets and fetch water twice; then we'll talk about pay." "I won't fail you," promised the youth, setting to his task.

Options:
ক. উক্ত অনুচ্ছেদে সরাসরি বাক্যগুলোর যথাযথ রূপ দিয়ে লিখো (punctuation সহ)।

গ. 'fair wage' শব্দগুচ্ছটির অর্থ বুঝিয়ে বাংলা অনুবাদ লেখো।
ঘ. কজনোর সংকল্প এবং কর্তাকে কীভাবে বোঝা যায়—সংক্ষিপ্ত বিশ্লেষণ দাও।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "Morning, stranger," called the craftsman from his doorway. A lanky youth answered, "I beg leave to work; I can mend baskets and carry water. I only ask a fair wage for my labor." The craftsman nodded, "If you truly wish to earn, help me mend three baskets and fetch water twice; then we'll talk about pay." "I won't fail you," promised the youth, setting to his task.

খ The youth promised that he would not fail the craftsman.

গ 'fair wage' অর্থ হচ্ছে 'ন্যায্য মজুরি' বা 'উপযুক্ত ও সঠিক পারিশ্রমিক'—বাংলায়: ন্যায্য মজুরি/পয়সা যা তার শ্রমের সম্মান ধরে।

ঘ যুবকের সংকল্পের প্রমাণ: সে সরাসরি 'I won't fail you' বলে প্রতিশ্রুতি দিল এবং সঙ্গে সঙ্গে কাজ শুরু করল—এটি তার দৃঢ় সংকল্প ও দায়িত্বশীলতা নির্দেশ করে; কর্তার প্রতিক্রিয়া (পরীক্ষামূলক কাজ দেয়া) দেখায় তিনি বিশ্বাসযোগ্যতা যাচাই করতে চান।

Explanation:
ক: প্রত্যেক সরাসরি কথ্যাংশ আলাদা কোটেশনের মধ্যে রাখার মাধ্যমে উদ্ধৃতি চিহ্ন ও বিরামচিহ্ন ঠিক করা হয়েছে—কমা, সেমিকোলন ও সেমিকোলন ব্যবহারে ভাষার প্রবাহ বজায় রাখা হয়েছে। খ: reported speech-এ 'won't' → 'would not' হওয়া স্বাভাবিক, তবে সংক্ষিপ্ত ও স্বচ্ছ উপস্থাপনার জন্য 'would not' বা 'wouldn't' এর সমতুল্য 'would not fail' ব্যবহার করা যায়; এখানে সহজ রূপে 'would not fail' নির্দেশ করা হয়েছে। গ: 'fair wage' অনুবাদে ন্যায্যতা ও শ্রমিকের শ্রমের মূল্য পরিপ্রেক্ষিত বিবেচ্য—অর্থাৎ মজুরি যাতে যথার্থ হয়। ঘ: সংক্ষেপে—যুবক প্রতিশ্রুতিবদ্ধ ও কাজের জন্য প্রস্তুত; কর্তার আচরণ যাচাইপ্রসূত ও বাস্তবসম্মত (শর্তসাপেক্ষ কাজ দিয়ে পারিশ্রমিক নির্ধারণ)।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "Excuse me, master," said a youth at dawn, "I've walked far and seek work for the day. I have nimble hands and honest intent." The master paused and asked, "What can you do?" The youth answered, "I can stack crates, polish brass, and deliver small parcels." "Very well," the master replied, "carry these jars to the courtyard and return at midday for your wages." "Thank you, sir," the youth said, bowing respectfully.

খ The youth thanked the master respectfully and bowed.

গ গৃহীত কাজগুলো: 1) stack crates (বাক্স/ক্রেট সাজানো), 2) polish brass (পিতল পালিশ করা), 3) deliver small parcels (ছোট চালান/প্যাকেজ পৌঁছে দেওয়া), 4) carry jars to the courtyard (জার বহন করে উঠানে নিয়ে যাওয়া).

ঘ যুবকের ভদ্রতা ও শ্রমিক হিসেবে অভিপ্রায় প্রতীয়মান: তিনি শালীন ভাষায় অনুরোধ করছেন ("Excuse me, master"), কৃতজ্ঞতা প্রকাশ করছেন ("Thank you, sir"), এবং কাজের প্রকারগুলো উল্লেখ করে দেখিয়েছেন যে তিনি দক্ষ ও পরিশ্রমী—এগুলি মিলিয়ে তার নৈতিক ও প্রকৃত শ্রমের মনোভাব স্পষ্ট হয়।

Explanation:
ক: সরাসরি উদ্ধৃত বাক্যগুলো যথাযথ কোটেশন মার্ক ও কমা ব্যবহার করে স্থাপন করা হয়েছে, প্রতিটি বক্তৃতাকে আলাদা কোটেশনের মধ্যে রাখা হয়েছে। খ: indirect speech-এ সাধারণত ক্রিয়ার কাল ও প্রনয়ন সামঞ্জস্য করা হয়; এখানে সরল ও স্বল্প বাক্য হিসেবে রূপান্তর করা হয়েছে: 'The youth thanked the master respectfully and bowed.' গ: অনুচ্ছেদ থেকে সরাসরি কাজগুলোর তালিকা করা হয়েছে; কাজগুলো স্পষ্টভাবে উল্লেখিত হওয়ায় নির্দেশ করা সহজ। ঘ: ভদ্রতা ও শ্রমিক মনোভাবের প্রমাণ কথোপকথন ও ক্রিয়াকলাপে প্রকাশ পায়—শ্রদ্ধাসূচক সম্বোধন, ধন্যবাদ, কাজের বিবরণ এবং নিয়মিত সময়ে ফিরে আসার প্রতিশ্রুতি সবই তার ঐচ্ছিক ও পরিশ্রমী চরিত্রের ইঙ্গিত দেয়।

ঘ. দোকানদারের আচরণকে এক বাক্যে ব্যাখ্যা করো এবং দুইটি বাক্যাংশ দিয়ে তার সমর্থন করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "Good evening, where are you going?" asked the shopkeeper. A young girl, carrying a bundle, replied, "I am looking for someone to teach me sewing so that I can earn honestly." "Do you truly wish to work?" asked the shopkeeper. "Yes, if you are willing to teach me," she answered. "Come tomorrow morning and help sweep the shop; then I'll see about teaching you," he said. "May God bless you," she whispered.

খ She said that she was looking for someone to teach her sewing so that she could earn honestly.

গ 'she' প্রতিস্থাপন করছে 'A young girl'—অর্থাৎ এটি উক্ত অনুচ্ছেদে কথ্যভাবে বলা মেয়েটির প্রতিশব্দ বা প্রণামবাচক সম্বোধন নয়, বরং সেই ব্যক্তি যিনি কথাগুলি বলছেন।

ঘ দোকানদারের আচরণ সহানুভূতিশীল এবং যুক্তিসঙ্গত; সমর্থন হিসেবে: (1) তিনি প্রথমে মেয়েটিকে প্রশ্ন করে কাজের ইচ্ছা যাচাই করলেন—"Do you truly wish to work?" এবং (2) সরল শর্তে সাহায্য করার প্রস্তাব দিলেন—"Come tomorrow morning and help sweep the shop; then I'll see about teaching you."

Explanation:
ক: উদ্ধৃতি চিহ্ন ও অন্তর্বর্তী কমা এবং বিরামচিহ্নগুলো প্রাসঙ্গিকভাবে বসানো হয়েছে—বাক্যভঙ্গি ও সরাসরি ভাষ্য আলাদা করতে প্রতিটি সরাসরি বাক্যকে কোটেশনের মধ্যে রাখা হয়েছে এবং কথ্যবৃত্তান্তের পরে প্রশ্নবাচক বা ক্রিয়াবিশেষ চিহ্ন সমন্বয় করা হয়েছে। খ: reported speech-এ প্রধান পরিবর্তনগুলো হল ক্রিয়ার কাল সামঞ্জস্য করা (present continuous 'am looking' → past continuous 'was looking') এবং প্রতিক্রিয়া অনুযায়ী 'can' → 'could'/'could earn' বা এখানে 'can'→'could' দেওয়াই উপযুক্ত; এছাড়া প্রণয়ন সাপেক্ষে বক্তৃতা-নাম পরিবর্তন করা। গ: 'she' একটি প্রতিশব্দ (pronoun) যা পূর্বোক্ত 'A young girl'-কে নির্দেশ করে—এটি কেবল একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত উপায়ে ব্যক্তিকে পুনরায় উল্লেখ করে। ঘ: দোকানদারের আচরণ বিশ্লেষণ করে দেখা যায় তিনি সহানুভূতিশীল (কারণ তিনি সাহায্য করার প্রস্তাব দিলেন) এবং বিবেচনাপূর্ণ/যুক্তিসঙ্গত (কারণ তিনি আগে কাজ ও প্রয়াস যাচাই করতে বললেন)।

Question:
Tourist: This temple looks ancient. How old is it?

Guide: It's a 12th-century temple built by King Paramardi.

Tourist: The carvings are exquisite.

Guide: We should head back; the area is declared a wildlife corridor after dusk so entry is restricted.

Tourist: Does that mean it's unsafe?

Options:
ক. এই মন্দিরটি কোন শতকের?
খ. কোন শাসক বা রাজা এটি নির্মাণ করেছিলেন?
গ. 'The area is declared a wildlife corridor after dusk' বাক্যের অর্থ কী?
ঘ. উপযুক্তভাবে একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত উত্তর লিখুন যা গাইড ট্যুরিস্টকে নিরাপত্তা সম্পর্কে নিশ্চিত করার জন্য বলতে পারে।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: 12th century (অর্থাৎ সাধারণত 1101–1200 খ্রিস্টাব্দের সময়কাল)।

খ উত্তর: King Paramardi — গাইড বলেছে এটি King Paramardi দ্বারা নির্মিত।

গ উত্তর: বাক্যটির মানে: সন্ধ্যার পর ঐ স্থানটি বন্যপ্রাণীর চলাচলের রাস্তা হিসেবে ঘোষিত—অর্থাৎ রাতের বেলা বন্যপ্রাণী ওই অঞ্চলে আসে বা চলাচল করে, তাই মানুষের উপস্থিতি সীমাবদ্ধ রাখা হয়।

ঘ উত্তর: সম্ভাব্য গাইডের সংক্ষিপ্ত নিশ্চয়তা: "It is generally safe during visiting hours; however, after dusk the area is restricted because of wildlife, so authorities close it for your safety." (বাংলায়: "দর্শনসময়ে সাধারণত নিরাপদ; কিন্তু সন্ধ্যার পরে বন্যপ্রাণীর কারণে এলাকাটি সীমাবদ্ধ করা হয়, তাই আপনার নিরাপত্তার জন্য বন্ধ রাখা হয়।")

Explanation:
ক: গাইড স্পষ্টভাবে '12th-century temple' বলেছেন; 12শ শতকটি 1101–1200 সালকে নির্দেশ করে।

খ: কথোপকথনে উল্লেখ আছে যে নির্মাতা ছিলেন King Paramardi, তাই উত্তর নিশ্চিত।

গ: 'wildlife corridor' টার্মটি নির্দেশ করে এমন একটি পথ বা এলাকা যেখানে বন্যপ্রাণী স্বাভাবিকভাবে চলাফেরা করে; সন্ধ্যার পরে সেখানে মানুষের উপস্থিতি প্রাণীর জন্যও আর মানুষদের জন্যও ঝুঁকিপূর্ণ হতে পারে।

ঘ: গাইডের উত্তরটি চাইলে দুটো কাজ করবে — দর্শনার্থীর আতঙ্ক কমানো (অধিকাংশ সময় দর্শনঘণ্টার মধ্যে নিরাপদ) এবং রাতের পরে সীমাবদ্ধ করার যৌক্তিক কারণ (বন্যপ্রাণী ও নিরাপত্তা) ব্যাখ্যা করা। উপরের বক্তব্যে উভয় উপাদানই সংযুক্ত করা হয়েছে।

Guide: Madam, it's a 17th-century structure.

Tourist: What a marvelous building!

Guide: It was commissioned by Shah Jahan around 1650.

Tourist: Is it safe to stay here after sunset?

Guide: The grounds close at dusk — the security does not allow visitors after sunset.

Options:
ক. ঘটনাস্থলটি কোন শতকের?
খ. এটি কে নির্মাণ/কমিশন করেছিলেন?
গ. Guide-এর 'We should move now' বাক্যটি reported speech-এ রূপান্তর করুন।
ঘ. সন্ধ্যার পরে দর্শনার্থীদের প্রবেশ নিষেধ করার দুটি যৌক্তিক কারণ লিখুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: 17th century (ঐ স্থাপনা 17শ শতকের). 17শ শতক সাধারণত 1601–1700 খ্রিস্টাব্দের সময়কালকে বোঝায়।

খ উত্তর: Shah Jahan — গাইড বলেছে এটি Shah Jahan কমিশন/নির্মাণ করেছেন (প্রশ্নোত্তরের কথ্য অংশ অনুসারে)।

গ উত্তর: Reported speech: The guide said (that) they should move then (because the sun was about to set). উদাহরণ: "The guide said that they should move then as the sun was about to set." (ইংরেজিতে এখনের 'now' → reported speech-এ 'then', 'we'→'they')

ঘ উত্তর: দুটি যৌক্তিক কারণ:
1) নিরাপত্তা ও দৃশ্যমানতার অভাব: অন্ধকারে পথে বাধা, পড়ে যাওয়ার ঝুঁকি এবং পর্যটকদের জন্য জরুরি সাহায্য পাওয়ার সমস্যা থাকে।
2) নিরাপত্তা নীতি ও সম্পত্তি সুরক্ষা: রাতে অপরাধ/ভাঙচুর বা অননুমোদিত প্রবেশ এড়াতে কর্তৃপক্ষ দর্শনার্থীদের সীমাবদ্ধ করে।

Explanation:
ক: গাইড সরাসরি বলেছে "it's a 17th-century structure"—এ থেকেই শতক নির্ণয় করা যায়; 17শ শতক বলতে 1601–1700 সাল বোঝায়।

খ: কথোপকথনে গাইড স্পষ্টভাবে 'commissioned by Shah Jahan' বলেছেন, তাই নির্মাতা/কমিশনার হিসেবে তিনি নির্দেশিত।

গ: সরাসরি বাক্য 'We should move now' কে reported speech-এ রূপান্তর করার সময় সাধারণত ব্যক্তিবাচক পরিবর্তন করা হয়: উচ্চারণকারীর প্রথম পুরুষ ('we') পরিবর্তিত হয় তৃতীয় পুরুষে ('they' বা 'he/she' নির্ভর প্রসঙ্গে), 'now' → 'then', এবং সময় ও কারণগুলো উপযুক্তভাবে backshift করা হয় (উদাহরণ দেখানো হয়েছে)।

ঘ: সন্ধ্যার পরে দর্শনার্থীদের অগ্রহণযোগ্য করার যুক্তিসঙ্গত কারণগুলি বাস্তবে নিরাপত্তা, অন্ধকারে দুর্ঘটনা, অপরাধ-প্রবণতা কমানো, সম্পত্তি রক্ষা এবং প্রয়োজনীয় এমার্জেন্সি সেবা পৌঁছানোর সমস্যার কারণে থাকে। উপরে দুটো কারণকে সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়েছে।

Question:
Tourist: How old is that tall tower by the sea?

Guide: Sir, it's a 19th-century lighthouse built by British engineers.

Tourist: The view is splendid!

Guide: We must leave now; the tide will come in soon and the path gets flooded.

Tourist: Is access blocked at night too?

Guide: Yes, security closes the area when the tide is high or after dusk for safety.

Options:
ক. টাওয়ারটি কোন শতকের?
খ. এটি কে নির্মাণ করেছিলেন?
গ. 'The tide will come in soon' এর মানে কী? সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করুন।
ঘ. পর্যটক কী ধরনের ভদ্রতা পূর্ণ প্রশ্ন করতে পারেন যদি তিনি nighttime safety জানতে চান? (একটি সম্ভাব্য বাক্য লিখুন)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: 19th century (অর্থাৎ 1801–1900 খ্রিস্টাব্দের সময়ের নির্মাণ). 

খ উত্তর: British engineers — গাইড সরাসরি বলেছেন যে এটি British engineers দ্বারা নির্মিত।

গ উত্তর: 'The tide will come in soon' মানে: সমুদ্রের জোয়ার ওঠবে এবং সমুদ্রের জল তীরে ঢুকবে, ফলে পাথ/path বা নিচু স্থানগুলো পানিতে ডুবতে পারে। এটি সেঁকড়ার উচ্চতা বাড়ার ফলে প্রবেশ পথ প্লাবিত হওয়ার সতর্কতা নির্দেশ করে।

ঘ উত্তর: সম্ভাব্য ভদ্র প্রশ্নের উদাহরণ: "Excuse me, could you please tell me whether the lighthouse area is safe for visitors at night?" অথবা বাংলায়: "দয়া করে বলবেন, রাতে এই এলাকায় দর্শনার্থীদের জন্য কি নিরাপদ?"

Explanation:
ক: গাইড স্পষ্টভাবে বলেছে '19th-century lighthouse' — তাই শতক নির্ধারিত।

খ: কথোপকথনে 'built by British engineers' বলা আছে; তাই নির্মাতারা ব্রিটিশ প্রকৌশলী।

গ: ইংরেজি অভিব্যক্তিটি সাধারণত সমুদ্রতত্ত্বগত ঘটনার নির্দেশ করে: 'tide comes in' = জোয়ার ওঠা, যা প্লাবিত হওয়ার ঝুঁকি তৈরি করে। নির্দেশিত কারণে পথটি প্লাবিত হয়ে অপ্রবেশযোগ্য বা বিপজ্জনক হয়ে পড়ে।

ঘ: ভদ্র ও কার্যকরী প্রশ্নটি সংক্ষিপ্ত, সম্মানজনক এবং সরাসরি—এরকম বাক্য নিরাপত্তা বা উপস্থিতি অনুমতি সম্পর্কে স্পষ্ট তথ্য পেতে সহায়ক।

খ উত্তর: (১) অপারেশন চলাকালে জ্বালানি দহন হয় না, তাই সরাসরি কার্বন ডাইঅক্সাইড বা অন্যান্য দূষক নির্গত হয় না। (২) এটি অপ্রদাহ্য উৎস — বাতাস অব্যাহতভাবে পুনরায় উৎপন্ন হয়, তাই শক্তি উৎপাদন স্থায়ী ও পরিবেশ-বন্ধু।

গ উত্তর: সুবিধা: এটি ফসিল জ্বালানির উপর নির্ভরতা কমায় এবং অপারেশনের সময় কম কার্বন নির্গমন করে। সীমাবদ্ধতা: বায়ুর গতিবৃদ্ধি অনিয়মিত, ফলে শক্তি সরবরাহ পরিবর্তনশীল (intermittent) এবং ব্যাকআপ বা স্টোরেজ দরকার হতে পারে।

ঘ উত্তর: (১) অফশোর উইন্ড ফার্ম যেখানে সমুদ্রতটে বড় টারবাইন বিন্যস্ত করে পর্যাপ্ত বিদ্যুৎ উৎপাদন করা হয়। (২) গ্রামীণ বা পাহাড়ি এলাকায় একক বা ছোট উইন্ডটারবাইন বাড়ি বা গ্রিড-সংযুক্ত লোডের জন্য বিদ্যুৎ সরবরাহে ব্যবহৃত হয়।

Explanation:
Wind energy মূলত বাতাসের সরলগত শক্তি সংগ্রহ করে তা ম্যাকানিক্যালভাবে ঘূর্ণন যন্ত্রপাতির মাধ্যমে বৈদ্যুতিক শক্তিতে রূপান্তর করে। কারণ এটি জ্বলন্ত জ্বালানির উপর নির্ভর করে না, অপারেশনের সময় সরাসরি বায়ুমণ্ডলে তাপীয় বা রাসায়নিক দূষণ সৃষ্টি করে না, তাই অনেকেই এটিকে 'clean' বা 'green' বলে। তবে বাতাস অনিয়মিত হওয়ায় শক্তির সরবরাহ নির্ভরশীলতার সমস্যা থাকতে পারে; এজন্য ব্যাটারি বা গ্রিড-সামঞ্জস্য প্রযুক্তি প্রয়োজন।

Question:
Two students talk about biomass after seeing wood chips near a power plant.

A: Is burning wood for electricity renewable?

B: People call it biomass energy — it's from organic material.

A: But does burning biomass pollute? How is it considered green?

Options:
ক. Biomass energy কী? সংক্ষিপ্ত সংজ্ঞা দাও।
খ. কিভাবে biomass-কে 'renewable' বলা হয় এবং 'carbon neutral' ধারণার সাথে এর সম্পর্ক কী? ব্যাখ্যা করো।
গ. Biomass-র তিনটি সাধারণ উৎস কি কি? সংক্ষিপ্ত তালিকা করো।
ঘ. Biomass ব্যবহারে একটি পরিবেশগত উদ্বেগ উল্লেখ করো এবং সেই উদ্বেগ কমানোর একটি উপায় বলো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: Biomass energy হলো জৈবিক উৎস (উদাহরণ: কাঠ, কৃষি অবশিষ্ট, পশু নির্গমন, বায়োজ্বালানী) থেকে শক্তি উৎপাদন; এই উপাদানগুলো জ্বালিয়ে বা বায়োকেমিক্যাল প্রক্রিয়ায় তাপ, বিদ্যুৎ বা জ্বালানি তৈরি করা হয়।

খ উত্তর: Biomass কে 'renewable' বলা হয় কারণ এ উৎপত্তি হওয়া উপকরণগুলো (গাছ, ফসল) পুনরায় জন্ম নিতে পারে এবং সঠিক ব্যবস্থাপনায় লম্বা সময় ধরে সংগ্রহযোগ্য। 'Carbon neutral' ধারণা হচ্ছে ধর্ষণ করে যে চারা গাছ যেগুলো বড় হয় তা জ্বালানী হিসাবে পোড়ানোর সময় যে CO2 বের হয়, সেই CO2 আবার নতুন গাছ শোষণ করবে — ফলে নেট কার্বন নির্গমন শূন্যের কাছাকাছি। তবে বাস্তবে সম্পূর্ণ carbon neutrality নির্ভর করে চাষের, পরিবহন-প্রক্রিয়াকরণ এবং বন ব্যবস্থাপনার উপর; যদি সম্মানিতভাবে ঘন ঘন কাটাছেঁড়া বা দূরপ্রতিসর ট্রান্সপোর্ট হয়, তখন নেট নির্গন নেতিবাচক হতে পারে।

গ উত্তর: (১) কাঠচিপ বা কাঠের ক্লিপিংস
(২) কৃষি অবশিষ্ট — ধানের চারা, ভুট্টার শংকু
(৩) জৈবিক বর্জ্য ও গবাদি পশুর ম্যানুর (biogas ফিডস্টক)

ঘ উত্তর: পরিবেশগত উদ্বেগ: বায়োইথানোল বা বায়োমাস চাষ বাড়ালে বন কাটা বা জমির উপর চাপ সৃষ্টি হতে পারে, যার ফলে জীববৈচিত্র্য হ্রাস ও মাটির ক্ষয় বাড়তে পারে। উদ্বেগ কমানোর উপায়: টেকসই সরবরাহ শৃঙ্খল — উদাহরণস্বরূপ পুনর্চাষ, অবশিষ্ট ব্যবহার (নতুন বন কাটা না করে কৃষি অবশিষ্ট ব্যবহার), এবং লাইফ-সাইকেল নিরীক্ষণ (LCA) প্রয়োগ করে মোট পরিবেশগত প্রভাব মূল্যায়ন।

Explanation:
Biomass-এ থাকা কেমিক্যাল বন্ডের শক্তি সূর্য থেকে উদ্ভিদে থাকা ফটোসিন্থেসিসের যোগে জমা হয়ে যায়। যদি ব্যবস্থাপনা টেকসইভাবে করা হয় — অর্থাৎ নতুন উদ্ভিদ বাড়ানো, পরিবহন ও চাষ-পরিচর্যার নির্গমন কম রাখা — তাহলে বায়োমাস তুলনামূলকভাবে পুনর্নবীকরণযোগ্য ও নিকট কার্বন-নিরপেক্ষ হিসেবে বিবেচিত হতে পারে। কিন্তু সম্পূর্ণ কার্বন-নিরপেক্ষ হওয়ার দাবিটি সবসময় সঠিক নয়; প্রকৃত প্রভাব নির্ভর করে সরবরাহ ও ব্যবহারের পুরো চক্রের উপর।

Question:
A group stands near a dam and discusses hydroelectric power.

A: The dam holds a lot of water — is that a form of green energy?

B: Yes, hydroelectricity uses water flow to spin turbines and produce electricity.

A: Are there any environmental trade-offs?

Options:
ক. Hydroelectric power কীভাবে বিদ্যুৎ উৎপাদন করে? সংক্ষেপে বলো।
খ. Hydro-কে কেন 'clean' বা 'renewable' বলা হয়? দুইটি যুক্তি দাও।
গ. Hydroelectric পদ্ধতির দুইটি সুবিধা উল্লেখ করো।
ঘ. Dam বা বড় হাইড্রো প্রকল্পের দুইটি সম্ভাব্য পরিবেশগত সমস্যা বলো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: Hydroelectric power উৎপন্ন হয় জলাধার বা নদীর জলকে উচ্চস্থানে সঞ্চিত করে রেখে দরকার অনুযায়ী সেই জলকে টারবাইন দিয়ে নিচে নামিয়ে আনা হয়; পানির পজিশনাল বা কাইনেটিক শক্তি টারবাইন ঘোরায় এবং জেনারেটর থেকে বৈদ্যুতিক শক্তি উত্পন্ন হয়।

খ উত্তর: (১) জ্বালানি জ্বালানো লাগে না — জল এর নিজস্ব শক্তি ব্যবহার করা হয়, তাই অপারেশনের সময় সরাসরি বায়ুতে দূষক নির্গত হয় না। (২) যদি জলসম্পদ টেকসইভাবে ব্যবহৃত হয় এবং পুনর্ভরতি ঘটে (বর্ষা, নদী প্রবাহ), তাহলে এটি পুনর্নবীকরণযোগ্য উৎস হিসেবে কাজ করে।

গ উত্তর: সুবিধা: (১) বড় পরিমানে ধারাবাহিক ও নির্ভরযোগ্য বিদ্যুৎ সরবরাহ করতে পারে (base-load ও পিক শেভিং)। (২) জলাধার শক্তি স্টোরেজ হিসাবে কাজ করতে পারে (পাম্পড-স্টোরেজ) যা বহনযোগ্যতা এবং গ্রিড-স্থিতিশীলতা বাড়ায়।

ঘ উত্তর: সমস্যা: (১) বড় ড্যাম নির্মাণে স্থানীয় বাস্তুতন্ত্র ও মাছ-মারগ প্রবাহ বিঘ্নিত হয়, জলজ জীববৈচিত্র্য ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হতে পারে। (২) মানুষের পুনর্বাসন ও সাংস্কৃতিক স্থান হারানো, এবং তলার জমিতে অবৈধ রূপে জমি ও মাটি ক্ষয় হওয়া; এছাড়াও স্ট্যান্ডিং ওয়াটারে জৈব দ্রবীভূত উপাদান থেকে মিথেন নির্গমন হতে পারে।

Explanation:
হাইড্রোইলেকট্রিক শক্তি জলরাশির শারীরবৃত্তীয় শক্তি ব্যবহার করে, যা কার্বন-তীব্র জলবিদ্যুৎ উৎপাদনে তুলনামূলকভাবে কম গ্রীনহাউস গ্যাস নির্গমন করে। তবে ড্যাম নির্মাণ ও জলপ্রবাহ পরিবর্তন অনেক সময় স্থানীয় বাস্তুতন্ত্র, মৎস্যসম্পদ ও সামাজিক কাঠামোতে বড় পরিবর্তন আনে। প্রকল্প পরিকল্পনার সময় পরিবেশগত প্রভাবক (EIA), মাছ চলাচলের ব্যবস্থা ও টেকসই জল ব্যবস্থাপনা বিবেচনা করা উচিত।

Question:
Student : Excuse me, Madam, may I come in?

Teacher : Yes, come in.

Student : Good morning, Madam. We would like to organize a science exhibition next month to showcase our projects.

Teacher : That sounds like a splendid idea. Prepare a written proposal and submit it to me so I can forward it to the headmaster.

Student : Certainly, Madam. We will submit it by the end of this week. Thank you.

Teacher : You are welcome. Good luck with the preparations.

Options:
ক. Write a formal application (about 80–100 words) to the headmaster requesting permission to hold the science exhibition.
খ. Change into indirect/reported speech: Student said, 'We would like to organize a science exhibition next month to showcase our projects.'
গ. Identify two polite expressions from the dialogue and explain why they are polite.
ঘ. Rewrite the teacher's phrase 'That sounds like a splendid idea' in a more formal sentence suitable for an official letter.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer:
To
The Headmaster
(Name of School)
Subject: Permission to hold a Science Exhibition
Respected Sir,
With due respect, we, the students of Class X (or the Science Club), wish to organize a science exhibition in the school during the first week of next month to display our projects and experiments. The event will enhance practical learning and encourage creativity among students. We will follow all school rules and arrange the exhibition under teacher supervision. Kindly grant us permission and any necessary assistance.
Thanking you,
Yours obediently,
(Representative's name)
On behalf of the students
Date: __________

খ Answer:
The student said that they would like to organize a science exhibition the following month to showcase their projects.

গ Answer:
1) "Excuse me, Madam" — This is polite because the student uses a respectful opening to gain attention without interrupting. "Excuse me" shows consideration.
2) "Thank you" — This expresses gratitude and acknowledges the teacher's help, which is courteous and respectful.

ঘ Answer:
A more formal version suitable for an official letter: "We consider this proposal to be highly educational and therefore recommend approval."

Explanation:
Explanation:
ক: The formal application includes standard parts: address to the authority, subject line, respectful salutation, brief purpose, reason/benefits, assurance of compliance, request for permission, closing, and signature. Keeping it concise (80–100 words) helps the headmaster decide quickly.

খ: For reported speech: 'would like' (past of 'would') becomes 'would like' in reported speech relative to the reporting verb 'said' — since the original is a polite modal expression, we keep it as 'would like' and change 'next month' to 'the following month' and adjust pronoun to 'they' (or 'we' to 'they' depending on perspective).

গ: Polite expressions often include courtesy phrases (excuse me, thank you) or respectful forms of address (Madam/Sir). They reduce abruptness and show respect, which is expected in formal school interactions.

ঘ: Formal register avoids conversational phrases like 'That sounds like...' and replaces them with objective, formal wording emphasizing recommendation or approval. Phrases like 'We consider this proposal to be...' or 'This proposal is commendable and merits approval' are commonly used in official contexts.

ক. Draft a short formal application (around 60–80 words) to the school management requesting funds to purchase the books.
খ. Convert into indirect speech: Librarian said, 'Please submit a list of required titles and an application stating the reasons.'
গ. Correct the following sentence from the student's line: 'Many current books are damaged or outdated.' If any change is needed, rewrite it; if correct, state why.
ঘ. Provide two polite closing sentences the student could use at the end of the application.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer:
To
The School Management
(Name of School)
Subject: Request for Funds to Purchase Reference Books and Novels
Respected Sir/Madam,
With due respect, we, the students of Class IX, request funding to purchase new reference books and novels for the school library. Several important books are damaged or outdated, which affects our studies and reading habits. A list of required titles is attached. We kindly request approval of necessary funds to procure these books at your earliest convenience.
Yours faithfully,
(Representative's name)
On behalf of the students
Date: __________

খ Answer:
The librarian requested that they submit a list of the required titles and an application stating the reasons.

গ Answer:
The sentence is correct in meaning but can be made slightly more formal: "Many of the existing books are damaged or outdated." The change adds clarity by specifying "existing books."

ঘ Answer:
1) "Thank you for your kind consideration." 
2) "We shall be grateful for your approval and assistance."

Explanation:
Explanation:
ক: The application follows a concise formal layout: recipient, subject, respectful salutation, brief statement of need, supporting detail (why funds are required), attached list, request for approval, and closing. Attaching a list strengthens the request.

খ: In reported speech, an imperative/request becomes 'requested that' or 'asked that' followed by a subjunctive or infinitive phrase: 'submit a list' -> 'submit a list' (kept as base form after 'requested that').

গ: The original sentence is grammatically acceptable, but adding 'of the existing' clarifies which books are meant and gives a slightly more formal tone suitable for an official application.

ঘ: Closing sentences in formal letters should show gratitude and politely request action. Both suggested closings are standard, courteous, and appropriate for school correspondence.

Curator : We should return to the bus now. The light will fade soon.

Traveler : Is it dangerous to stay here after dark?

Curator : No, but the site is closed to visitors after dusk due to safety regulations.


খ উত্তর: 16th century.

গ উত্তর (স্পষ্ট রূপান্তর): It was commissioned by Shah Jahan during his reign.

ঘ উত্তর: The curator asks visitors to leave before sunset because of safety and security: reduced visibility after dark increases risk of accidents (trips, falls), potential structural hazards in an old citadel, and official regulations or patrol schedules that prohibit civilian presence at night to prevent theft, vandalism, or unauthorized entry.

Explanation:
ক: সংশোধনে মূলত বড় হাতের অক্ষর, স্তবকবিচ্ছেদ এবং প্রয়োজনীয় প্রশ্নবিচিহ্ন যোগ করা হয়েছে; 'its' পরিবর্তে 'it's' প্রয়োগ করে সংক্ষিপ্ত রূপ ও মালিকানার পার্থক্য পরিষ্কার করা হয়েছে। গঠনে বাক্যগুলোকে ইংরেজি লেখনশৈলীর মানানসইভাবে বিন্যস্ত করা হয়েছে।

খ: সংলাপে কিউরেটর বলেছেন "it's from the 16th century"—এখানেই শতাব্দীর তথ্য স্পষ্ট।

গ: 'when he ruled' অনানুষ্ঠানিক ও আল্টারনেটিভ; 'during his reign' বা 'when he was ruler' বাক্যকে আরো নির্ভুল ও আনুষ্ঠানিক করে তোলে।

ঘ: নিরাপত্তা ও আইনগত কারণে সাইট বন্ধ রাখার যুক্তি দুটি মাত্রা রাখে — (1) নিরাপত্তা (দুর্ঘটনা ও অনিরাপদ অবস্থা), (2) নিরাপত্তা-নিয়ন্ত্রণ (চোরাই প্রবেশ, ভাঙচুর)। তাই সন্ধ্যার আগে প্রস্থান করানো হয়।

খ উত্তর: 14th century (the fourteenth century).

গ উত্তর (reported speech): The archaeologist said that the king of that era had ordered its construction.

ঘ উত্তর: প্রধান তিনটি কারণ — (1) Preservation: to prevent damage and unauthorized touching or removal of artifacts; (2) Safety: poor lighting increases accident risk in unstable ruins; (3) Security: to deter theft, vandalism, or trespassing at night.

Explanation:
ক: এখানে প্রশ্নবাচক বাক্যে প্রশ্নবিচিহ্ন এবং প্রয়োজনে কমা ও অ্যাপস্ট্রফি ('it's') সংযোজন করা হয়েছে; বহুবচন/একবচন মিলিয়ে সঠিক ক্রিয়া ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।

খ: 'fourteenth century' সরাসরি শতাব্দীর নির্দেশ করে।

গ: সরাসরি বক্তৃতা থেকে reported speech-এ আনার সময় ক্রিয়ার কাল ও নির্দেশক শব্দ (that) ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে; অতীত কাল ('had ordered') ব্যবহারে মূল বক্তব্যের ঘটে যাওয়ার সময়কে স্পষ্ট করা হয়েছে।

ঘ: রাতের পর সাইট বন্ধ রাখার নীতিমালা সাধারণত এই তিনটিতে নির্ভর করে—সংরক্ষণ, ভৌত নিরাপত্তা ও আইন/নীতি রক্ষা।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক সংশোধিত সংলাপ:

Wife : How old is this fortress?

Guard : It's from the 15th century, ma'am.

Husband : What a beautiful fortress!

Guard : It was constructed under the patronage of Rana Sanga.

Wife : I wish we could stay longer.

Guard : I'm sorry, madam. Visitors are not permitted once the sun sets.

Husband : Are there any real dangers after nightfall?

Guard : There aren't, but regulations are strict to protect the monument and visitors.


খ উত্তর: 15th century.

গ উত্তর (সংক্ষিপ্ত বিকল্প): It was built under Rana Sanga's patronage.

ঘ উত্তর: ব্যাকরণগত বিশ্লেষণ — 'There aren't' এখানে একটি সংক্ষেপ রূপ, পূর্ণ রূপ হবে 'There are not.' দুটিরই অর্থ একই; 'aren't' অপ্রাতিষ্ঠানিক কথ্য ও লেখ্যরূপে স্বাভাবিক, কিন্তু আনুষ্ঠানিক লেখায় 'are not' ব্যবহার করা বেশি উপযুক্ত। বাক্যটিতে প্রসঙ্গ হলো: guard বলেছেন যে বাস্তব কৃত্রিম বিপদ (danger) নেই ('There are not'), কিন্তু নীতিমালা কঠোর কারণ তারা স্মৃতিস্তম্ভ ও দর্শকদের সুরক্ষা নিশ্চিত করতে চায়।

Explanation:
ক: সংশোধনের মূল লক্ষ্য ছিল প্রশ্নবোধক চিহ্ন, কমা ও অ্যাপস্ট্রফি ('it's'), এবং উপযুক্ত বিন্যাস যোগ করে সংলাপকে স্বাভাবিক কথ্য-লিখন মানের সাথে মেলানো।

খ: guard স্পষ্টভাবে বলেছে '15th century'—এটি নির্মাণের শতাব্দী সনাক্ত করে।

গ: সংক্ষিপ্তাকারে মালিকানার রূপ ('Rana Sanga's patronage') ব্যবহার করে বাক্যকে কম ও স্বচ্ছ করা হয়েছে।

ঘ: 'aren't' ও 'are not' অর্থগতভাবে সমান; সাবজেক্ট-ভিত্তিক ব্যবহার ও ফর্মালিটি অনুযায়ী বেছে নেওয়া হয়। এখানে guard কথ্যভাবে 'There aren't' বললেও প্রসঙ্গটি আনুষ্ঠানিক নীতির ব্যাখ্যা তাই পূর্ণ রূপও গ্রহণযোগ্য।

Question:
Context: A tourist and the lighthouse keeper have a short, slightly faulty conversation while visiting an old coastal lighthouse. The original lines (uncorrected) are shown below:

Keeper : lighthouse was built 1802 by mr smith

Tourist : How tall is it

Keeper : About fifty metres

Tourist : Is it safe to climb at night

Keeper : No, its closed after sunset because of maintanance

Options:
ক. Rewrite the conversation correctly with proper punctuation and capitalization.
খ. Identify the tense and voice of the sentence: "The lighthouse was built in 1802 by Mr. Smith."
গ. Change the sentence "No, it's closed after sunset because of maintenance." into reported speech (keeper as the reporting subject).
ঘ. Give one clear reason (one sentence) explaining why the lighthouse is closed after sunset based on the context.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Keeper: The lighthouse was built in 1802 by Mr. Smith.

Tourist: How tall is it?

Keeper: About fifty metres.

Tourist: Is it safe to climb at night?

Keeper: No, it's closed after sunset because of maintenance.

খ Answer: Past Simple, Passive voice. "Was built" is past simple passive indicating a completed action in the past where the object (the lighthouse) is the focus.

গ Answer: The keeper said that the lighthouse was closed after sunset because of maintenance.

ঘ Answer: The lighthouse is closed after sunset to ensure visitors' safety and to allow maintenance work to be carried out without interference.

Explanation:
ক (punctuation and capitalization): Each spoken line begins with a capital letter and ends with appropriate punctuation. Questions take question marks; proper nouns are capitalized (Mr. Smith).

খ (tense and voice): "Was built" uses the past simple passive: past simple (was + past participle) and passive because the subject (lighthouse) receives the action; the doer (Mr. Smith) is optionally mentioned after "by".

গ (reported speech): When converting to reported speech, present or past time references may shift: here keeper's present-simple contraction "it's closed" becomes "was closed" in reported speech if reporting in past tense. We include the reporting clause "The keeper said that..." and convert the contraction and explain reason with "because of maintenance" unchanged.

ঘ (reason): The explanation references two likely concerns given the context: safety in low visibility after dark and the need for unobstructed maintenance work. Either point justifies restricting access after sunset.

Question:
Context: A tourist and a museum guide talk near a gallery of old sculptures. The raw dialog (with errors) is:

Tourist : What are these statues from

Guide : 17th century they were sculpted by unknown artisans

Tourist : Are they originals

Guide : yes but restored in the 1950s

Tourist : Can we take photos

Guide : No flash will damage them

Options:
ক. Rewrite the dialogue correctly with proper punctuation and capitalization.
খ. Point out one sentence that is in passive voice and explain why passive is used there.
গ. Rewrite "Yes, but restored in the 1950s" as a complete sentence in Present Perfect tense.
ঘ. Explain briefly (one or two sentences) why flash photography is prohibited in galleries housing old sculptures.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Tourist: What are these statues from?

Guide: They are from the 17th century; they were sculpted by unknown artisans.

Tourist: Are they originals?

Guide: Yes, but they were restored in the 1950s.

Tourist: Can we take photos?

Guide: No; flash will damage them.

খ Answer: "They were sculpted by unknown artisans." is passive voice. Passive is used to emphasize the action or the statues (the patient) when the doers (the artisans) are unknown or less important.

গ Answer: They have been restored in the 1950s. (Better: They have been restored since the 1950s.)

ঘ Answer: Flash photography is prohibited because intense light can accelerate the fading and chemical deterioration of pigments and surface finishes; for fragile, historic materials even brief exposure may cause long-term damage.

Explanation:
ক: Corrections include adding question marks, capital letters at sentence starts, and punctuation to separate clauses. The guide's first line was split into a clearer declarative sentence plus a passive clause.

খ: Passive construction focuses on the sculptures and masks the agents (unknown artisans). Museums often use passive in labels and descriptions when the creator's identity is unknown or not the focus.

গ: Present perfect (have/has + past participle) links past restoration actions to the present state (i.e., they are now in a restored condition). Note: If you want to keep the specific decade, you might say "They were restored in the 1950s" (simple past) to emphasize the time.

ঘ: The explanation ties to conservation science: flashes emit short bursts of intense light, contributing to photochemical damage. Museums forbid flash to prolong preservation of vulnerable materials.

Question:
Context: At an old hill fort a tourist and a local guide exchange a brief conversation. The unpolished dialogue is:

Tourist : This fort seems very old

Guide : Its a 12 century fort build by Emperor Rana

Tourist : Who constructed the massive gates

Guide : The gates were constructed by local artisans and painters decorated them

Tourist : Can we stay till dusk

Guide : No the authorities doesnt allow visitors after dusk

Options:
ক. Rewrite the dialogue correctly with proper punctuation, spelling, and grammar.
খ. Identify and correct the century expression "12 century" to the properly hyphenated form used in English adjectives.
গ. Convert the direct speech "The authorities don't allow visitors after dusk" into reported speech, using the guide as the reporting subject.
ঘ. Identify the grammatical error in "the authorities doesnt allow" and correct it; explain the rule briefly.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Tourist: This fort seems very old.

Guide: It's a 12th-century fort built by Emperor Rana.

Tourist: Who constructed the massive gates?

Guide: The gates were constructed by local artisans, and painters decorated them.

Tourist: Can we stay till dusk?

Guide: No; the authorities don't allow visitors after dusk.

খ Answer: Correct form: "12th-century" (hyphenated when used as a compound adjective before a noun).

গ Answer: The guide said that the authorities didn't allow visitors after dusk.

ঘ Answer: Error: "doesnt" is incorrect because the auxiliary must agree with the plural subject "authorities." Correct form: "don't" (do not). Rule: Use "do/does" to form negatives; "does" pairs with singular third-person subjects (he/she/it), while "do" pairs with I/you/we/they (plural).

Explanation:
ক: Corrections include adding contractions and apostrophes (It's), ordinal form for the century (12th), hyphenation for compound adjectives (12th-century fort), commas to separate clauses, question marks for questions, and splitting run-on phrases.

খ: When a numeral plus suffix functions as an adjective before a noun we use the ordinal with a hyphen: "12th-century fort." Without the hyphen it can be unclear that the phrase modifies the noun.

গ: In reported speech, present-tense negatives shift to the past-tense negative if the reporting verb is in the past (said). "Don't" becomes "didn't" (or "did not"); here we used "didn't" because the reporting verb "said" is in the past.

ঘ: Subject–verb agreement: "authorities" is plural, so the plural auxiliary "do/don't" is required. "Doesn't" matches singular third-person subjects only. Always match auxiliary verbs to subject number and person.

Question:
Meera : Do you read magazines during your free time, Raju?

Raju : Yes, sometimes.

Meera : I think magazines keep you updated and make you more creative.

Raju : I usually read short online articles; magazines take more time.

Meera : Printed magazines often contain in-depth features and interviews.

Raju : Maybe I will try reading a magazine every week.

Options:
ক. Dialogue-টি সঠিক বিরামচিহ্ন, বড় অক্ষর ও বানানসহ পুনর্লিখো।

ক Meera: Do you read magazines during your free time, Raju?

Raju: Yes, sometimes.

Meera: I think magazines keep you updated and make you more creative.

Raju: I usually read short online articles; magazines take more time.

Meera: Printed magazines often contain in-depth features and interviews.

Raju: Maybe I will try reading a magazine every week.

খ Raju said that he might (or would) try reading a magazine every week.

গ 1) Magazines keep you updated. 2) Printed magazines contain in-depth features and interviews.

ঘ "That's great — start with one short magazine this week; I'll recommend a good issue for you."

Explanation:
ক: মূল লক্ষ হলো প্রতিটি বাক্যে সঠিক ইনিশিয়াল ক্যাপিটালাইজেশন, প্রশ্নবোধক চিহ্ন এবং প্রয়োজনীয় বিরামচিহ্ন (কমা, সেমিকোলন, ফুলস্টপ) ব্যবহার করা। খ: Reported speech-এ ভবিষ্যৎ সম্ভাবনা বা ইচ্ছা প্রকাশ এমনভাবে রূপান্তর করা হয় যে বাক্যটির মূল অর্থ বজায় থাকে: 'Maybe I will try ...' becomes 'he said that he might/would try ...' (might বেশি অনুকূল)। গ: বাক্যগুলোর মধ্যে স্পষ্টভাবে Meera দুইটি কারণ দিয়েছেন — আপডেট থাকা ও গভীর লেখা। ঘ: উৎসাহমূলক এবং সাহায্যসূচক ভাষা ব্যবহার করে Raju-কে অনুপ্রাণিত করা যায়; একটি প্রস্তাবসহ ভদ্র বাক্য বেশি কার্যকর।

Question:
Sita : I don't read much news because it wastes mine time.

Anil : I have been reading online news for months; it keeps me aware.

Sita : I think print newspapers are old-fashioned.

Anil : Both formats have pros and cons.

Options:
ক. Anil-এর বাক্য 'I have been reading online news for months' থেকে টেন্স শনাক্ত করো ও নাম বলো।
খ. অনুদিত বাক্যটি simple past-এ রূপান্তর করো।
গ. Sita-এর বাক্যে ভুল খুঁজে তা শুদ্ধ করে লেখো।
ঘ. Sita-এর মতামতকে একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত (one-line) বাক্যে paraphrase করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক টেন্স: Present Perfect Continuous (Present Perfect Progressive). অর্থ: গত কিছু সময় ধরে ক্রিয়া চলমান আছে।

খ Simple past: I read online news for months. (Better natural phrasing: I read online news for months.)

গ শুদ্ধ বাক্য: I don't read much news because it wastes my time.

ঘ Paraphrase: Sita believes that printed newspapers are old-fashioned and she prefers not to read them.

Explanation:
ক: 'have been reading' হলো present perfect continuous, যা অতীত থেকে বর্তমান পর্যন্ত ক্রিয়ার ধারাবাহিকতা বোঝায়। খ: Simple past-এ ব্যবহৃত ফর্ম সাধারণত 'read' (উচ্চারণ ভিন্ন) — কিন্তু প্রসঙ্গবশত 'I read online news for months' বলেছেন। যদি একটি নিদিষ্ট সময় শেষ হয়ে থাকে, এটি উপযুক্ত। গ: Sita 'mine time' লিখেছে — সঠিক সর্বনাম হলো 'my'। ঘ: Paraphrেজ করতে মূল ভাব বজায় রেখে সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে বলা হয়েছে যে Sita printed newspapers-কে পুরানো মনে করে।

Karim : I am worried I won't be able to keep the habit.

Salma : Start with ten minutes and gradually increase the time.

ঘ. Karim-এর উদ্বেগকে মোকাবিলা করার জন্য একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত SMART-style লক্ষ্য (এক বাক্যে) লেখো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Future Continuous: I will be reading every day.

খ Reported speech: Salma said (that) Karim was worried that he wouldn't be able to keep the habit.

গ 1) Start with ten minutes each day. 2) Gradually increase the reading time (start small and build up).

ঘ SMART-style goal: "I will read for 10 minutes every morning for the next 30 days to build a daily reading habit."

Explanation:
ক: Future Continuous ব্যবহার করলে ক্রিয়ার ধারাবাহিক ভবিষ্যৎ ক্রিয়া বোঝায় — 'will be reading'। খ: Reported speech-এ present tense/statement থেকে appropriate tense backshift করা হয়; 'I am worried I won't...' becomes 'he was worried that he wouldn't...' (context অনুযায়ী)। গ: Salma সরাসরি দুটো কৌশল দিয়েছে — ছোট সময় দিয়ে শুরু ও ধীরে ধীরে বৃদ্ধি। ঘ: SMART-এ (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) লক্ষ্য নির্ধারণ করা হয়েছে: সময় নির্দিষ্ট (10 মিনিট), মাপযোগ্য (প্রতিদিন), অর্জনযোগ্য ও সময়সীমা (30 দিন) দিয়ে habit গঠন সহজ হয়।

Question:
Conversation between two classmates about poor exam results:

Me: Hi Sami, how are you?

Sami: I'm tired and sad.

Me: Why? You look down.

Sami: I fail to concentrate. I stay up late playing mobile games.

Me: That's why your marks are low. You must manage your time.

Sami: I know, but I can't stop.

Me: Try small steps: reduce playing time, set a study schedule, take short breaks.

Sami: I will try. Thanks.

Options:
ক. Rewrite the conversation with correct punctuation, capitalization, and minimal grammatical fixes.
খ. Convert the corrected conversation into reported (indirect) speech.
গ. Give two clear, practical pieces of advice Sami can follow to improve his marks.
ঘ. Compose a short apology reply from Sami acknowledging his mistake (one or two sentences).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Me: Hi Sami. How are you?

Sami: I'm tired and sad.

Me: Why? You look down.

Sami: I fail to concentrate. I stay up late playing mobile games.

Me: That's why your marks are low. You must manage your time.

Sami: I know, but I can't stop.

Me: Try small steps: reduce playing time, set a study schedule, and take short breaks.

Sami: I will try. Thanks.


খ I greeted Sami and asked how he was. Sami replied that he was tired and sad. I asked why, noting that he looked down. Sami said he failed to concentrate and that he stayed up late playing mobile games. I told him that this was the reason his marks were low and that he must manage his time. Sami admitted he knew but could not stop. I suggested small steps — to reduce playing time, set a study schedule, and take short breaks. Sami said he would try and thanked me.


গ 1) Set a fixed bedtime and use a simple alarm or app to limit gaming to at most 30–45 minutes in the evening. Replace the extra gaming time with a focused 30–45 minute study session.

2) Use the Pomodoro method: study 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break; after four cycles take a longer 20–30 minute break. Track progress in a short checklist each day.


ঘ Sami: I'm sorry for wasting so much time on games. I realize it's hurting my studies; I'll cut down my playtime and follow a study plan.

Explanation:
ক: Fixed punctuation and capitalization for readability; added a slight wording change to make sentences natural (e.g., "That's why your marks are low.").

খ: Reported speech requires backshifting of present simple to past simple where appropriate ("I'm tired" -> "he was tired"); direct questions become statements introduced by verbs like "asked" or "noted." I combined lines to make a coherent indirect narrative.

গ: Advice items are practical and specific: limiting gaming with concrete time limits, replacing game time with focused study, and using a time-management technique (Pomodoro) that is easy to apply. Specific steps increase the chance Sami will follow them.

ঘ: The apology is brief and admits fault with a commitment to change, which is appropriate for the context and shows responsibility.

Question:
Short exchange about social media distraction:

Asha: Morning. You seem worried.

Riya: Yes. My results were not good.

Asha: What happened? You prepared last month, didn't you?

Riya: I thought I would revise, but I kept scrolling through social media and lost hours.

Asha: That explains it. Social media can eat time quickly.

Riya: I feel guilty. How can I get back on track?

Asha: Start by deleting one app for a week, schedule study blocks, and review key points daily.

Riya: I'll do that. Thank you.

Options:
ক. Rewrite Asha and Riya's dialogue correcting grammar and punctuation and making it sound natural.
খ. Identify the main cause of Riya's poor result and state it in one clear sentence.
গ. Provide three short 'do' or 'don't' rules Riya should follow for the next month (each rule one sentence).
ঘ. Write a two-sentence follow-up message from Asha encouraging Riya.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Asha: Good morning. You look worried.

Riya: Yes, my results were not good.

Asha: What happened? You prepared last month, didn't you?

Riya: I planned to revise, but I kept scrolling through social media and lost hours.

Asha: That explains it. Social media can quickly eat up time.

Riya: I feel guilty. How can I get back on track?

Asha: Start by removing one app for a week, schedule study blocks, and review key points daily.

Riya: I'll do that. Thank you.


খ The main cause of Riya's poor result was excessive time spent scrolling social media, which reduced the time available for focused revision.


গ 1) Do schedule two focused study blocks of 45 minutes each every day and record them in a planner.

2) Don't open social media during study blocks; put your phone in another room or use an app blocker.

3) Do review the day's three most important points each evening for 10–15 minutes.


ঘ Asha: Don't be discouraged — small consistent changes will help. I'll check in next week to hear about your progress.

Explanation:
ক: Minor phrasing and punctuation fixes improve clarity (e.g., "You look worried"; "I planned to revise"). Word order and contractions were smoothed for natural conversation.

খ: The sentence isolates the single actionable cause: time lost to social media, which directly displaced revision time.

গ: Rules are concise and actionable: schedule, remove distraction, and short daily reviews. Each rule is practical and measurable, making it easier to follow and track.

ঘ: The follow-up message combines encouragement with accountability; both elements increase motivation and the likelihood of follow-through.

Question:
A brief talk between teacher and student about attendance and part-time work:

Teacher: Hello, Arif. I've noticed your attendance has fallen.

Arif: Yes, sir. I work evenings at a café to help my family; I miss morning classes.

Teacher: Working is commendable, but missing classes affects learning.

Arif: I try to read notes later, but I get tired and fall behind.

Teacher: Let's plan a solution together so you can balance both responsibilities.

Arif: I appreciate that, sir.

Options:
ক. Rewrite the exchange with polished formal language suitable for a school record.
খ. Transform the polished exchange into reported speech suitable for a meeting summary.
গ. Suggest a three-step weekly plan Arif could follow to balance work and studies (bullet points).
ঘ. Write a one-sentence empathetic note the teacher can send to Arif to encourage him.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Teacher: Hello Arif. I have observed that your attendance has decreased recently.

Arif: Yes, sir. I work evenings at a café to support my family, and as a result I miss morning classes.

Teacher: While your work is admirable, regular absence is affecting your learning and progress.

Arif: I attempt to study from the notes later, but due to fatigue I fall behind.

Teacher: Let us devise a plan together to help you balance your work and studies.

Arif: Thank you, sir. I appreciate your support.


খ The teacher stated that he had observed Arif's decreased attendance. Arif explained that he worked evenings at a café to support his family and consequently missed morning classes. The teacher acknowledged that the work was commendable but noted that regular absence was impairing Arif's learning. Arif admitted that although he tried to study from notes afterward, fatigue caused him to fall behind. The teacher proposed collaborating to create a plan to balance work and study, and Arif expressed appreciation.


গ - Plan fixed study sessions: Block three study sessions per week of 60–90 minutes on days when Arif does not work mornings; record topics to cover each session.

- Use short, focused reviews: After work, spend 20–30 minutes reviewing class notes on the same day to reinforce learning without exhausting himself.

- Communicate with teachers: Agree on at most two missed classes per week with advance notice and collect summaries or recorded lectures to catch up efficiently.


ঘ Teacher's note: I understand your situation and will support you; together we will find a schedule that lets you work and keep up with your studies.

Explanation:
ক: Language was formalized for an official record: "observed," "decreased attendance," and respectful phrasing make the dialogue appropriate for documentation.

খ: The reported version summarizes each speaker's main point in neutral language suitable for meeting minutes; tense and phrasing were adjusted to past narrative style.

গ: The weekly plan focuses on feasibility: limited longer sessions when possible, short daily reviews to counteract forgetting, and proactive communication with teachers to manage absences. These steps consider Arif's fatigue and responsibility.

ঘ: The teacher's sentence conveys empathy and partnership concisely, which helps motivate Arif while signaling institutional support.

Question:
A young baker stood at the bakery door and spoke to the master without any punctuation in his words: "good morning master I want to learn baking please teach me" the master looked up and said "do you really mean to work hard" the boy replied "yes master I will rise early and stay late" the master smiled and answered "then come in and start tomorrow"

Options:
ক. Punctuate and format the above dialogue correctly with quotation marks, commas, and capitalization.
খ. Rewrite the master's second line (Do you really mean to work hard?) as reported (indirect) speech.
গ. Combine the boy's two short sentences into one clear sentence using appropriate conjunction.
ঘ. State the main idea or moral of this short exchange in one sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "Good morning, Master. I want to learn baking; please teach me," said the boy. The master looked up and said, "Do you really mean to work hard?" The boy replied, "Yes, Master. I will rise early and stay late." The master smiled and answered, "Then come in and start tomorrow." 

খ The master asked whether the boy really meant to work hard. 

গ The boy said that he would rise early and stay late to learn the craft. 

ঘ The main idea: Hard work and willingness to learn are required to master a craft.

Explanation:
ক: Quotation marks enclose each spoken sentence. Commas separate the reporting verb when the quote continues into dialogue tags (e.g., "please teach me," said the boy). Capital letters begin sentences and proper nouns (Master). A question inside quotes ends with a question mark before the closing quote. Semicolon used to link closely related independent clauses when appropriate. 

খ: To form reported speech, change the question into a statement structure and adjust verb forms and pronouns as needed; since this is present simple in a past reporting context, maintain sense without tense change here because it's universal meaning. A typical transformation: "Do you really mean... ?" -> "asked whether he really meant..." We used "asked whether the boy really meant to work hard."

গ: Joining two short sentences avoids choppiness; use conjunctions or phrase restructuring. Here a simple relative or that-clause makes it smooth: "He said that he would rise early and stay late."

ঘ: The moral is inferred from the dialogue: the boy's readiness to work and the master's condition for teaching show that effort and dedication matter.

Question:
At the market a seller shouted to a young customer in a tangled sentence: "fresh oranges cheap take them all by Allah they are sweet" the customer frowned and asked "how many for a dirham" the seller answered "three for a dirham and if you take two bags I'll give a discount" the customer replied "alhamdulillah I am pleased"

Options:
ক. Correctly punctuate and present the seller's opening sentence, including the phrase "By Allah" appropriately.
খ. Change the customer's question into indirect speech.
গ. Rewrite the seller's pricing line into a clearer sentence using parentheses for the price per orange: (price per orange).
ঘ. Briefly comment on the cultural use of phrases like "By Allah" and "Alhamdulillah" in short dialogues—one sentence each.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "Fresh oranges! Cheap—take them all. By Allah, they are sweet!" the seller shouted. 

খ The customer asked how many oranges he could get for a dirham. 

গ "Three for a dirham (approximately 0.33 dirham per orange). If you take two bags, I'll give a discount." 

ঘ "By Allah" is an emphatic oath used to stress truthfulness or sincerity; "Alhamdulillah" expresses gratitude or relief, meaning "praise be to God."

Explanation:
ক: Exclamations and advertising cries in markets are punctuated with exclamation marks and short sentences for emphasis. The phrase "By Allah" should be capitalized as it begins the clause and followed by a comma when used parenthetically. 

খ: Indirect (reported) speech turns the direct question into a statement that reports the content without quotation marks; tense and pronoun changes may be needed depending on context. 

গ: Giving a per-unit price in parentheses clarifies cost; rewriting long clauses into two sentences clarifies the offer and the discount condition. 

ঘ: Such religious phrases are common in many cultures: they function as emphatic expressions or polite social markers rather than carrying formal legal force. They reflect speaker sincerity ("By Allah") or gratitude ("Alhamdulillah") and are often used conversationally.

Question:
On a dusty road a traveller stopped a passerby and blurted out without punctuation: "Excuse me could you tell me the way to the river I'll pay you if you guide me" the passerby laughed and said "I can show you but why pay me" the traveller answered "because I have little time and much luggage" the passerby agreed "very well follow me"

খ. Convert the traveller's offer "I'll pay you" into a polite conditional sentence.
গ. Identify and correct any comma splice or run-on sentence in the original text.
ঘ. Explain in one sentence why the passerby asked "but why pay me?"


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "Excuse me, could you tell me the way to the river? I'll pay you if you guide me," said the traveller. The passerby laughed and said, "I can show you, but why pay me?" The traveller answered, "Because I have little time and much luggage." The passerby agreed, "Very well; follow me." 

খ Polite conditional: "I would be grateful to pay you if you could guide me." 

গ The original contained a run-on between "the way to the river I'll pay you if you guide me"; it needs a question mark or semicolon and proper separation: "the way to the river? I'll pay you if you guide me." Also "I can show you but why pay me" needs a comma before the conjunction and a question mark: "I can show you, but why pay me?"

ঘ The passerby asked "but why pay me?" because guiding someone is a small favour and he wanted to know the traveller's reason for offering money instead of a simple request for help.

Explanation:
ক: Dialogue punctuation requires that each spoken line be enclosed in quotation marks; questions get question marks inside the quotes; commas separate tag phrases (e.g., "said the traveller"). Short interjections like "Very well" can be followed by a semicolon or comma before the command. 

খ: To make an offer more polite and conditional, use "would" and "could" or an expression of gratitude ("I would be grateful"). This softens the direct promise and fits polite requests. 

গ: A comma splice or run-on occurs when independent clauses are joined without proper punctuation. Breaking sentences with appropriate punctuation (question marks, commas, semicolons) fixes clarity. 

ঘ: The passerby’s question asks for motive—if payment is offered, it changes the nature of the request from a favour to a transaction, so he is clarifying why money is involved.

Question:
Entering the kitchen my mother sniffed the air and exclaimed in irritation What a mess youve left here Why do you keep using the stove if you never clean up afterwards

Options:
ক. Rewrite the speaker's words with correct punctuation and capitalization (direct speech).
খ. Change the corrected direct speech into reported (indirect) speech.
গ. Write a short, polite apology the speaker could say in response.
ঘ. Identify two mistakes in the original line and give their corrections.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "Entering the kitchen, my mother sniffed the air and exclaimed in irritation, \"What a mess you've left here! Why do you keep using the stove if you never clean up afterwards?\""

খ My mother entered the kitchen, sniffed the air, and exclaimed in irritation that it was a mess and asked why I kept using the stove if I never cleaned up afterwards.

গ "I'm really sorry, Mum. I'll clean everything up right away and make sure I tidy the kitchen after I cook in the future."

ঘ Two mistakes and corrections:
1) youve → you've (missing apostrophe). Corrected: "you've".
2) Missing punctuation between sentences: there should be a question mark after the second clause. Corrected: add "?" after "afterwards" and exclamation mark after "here".

Explanation:
ক: Direct speech needs opening and closing quotation marks, correct capitalization (What → What), and appropriate punctuation (exclamation mark for strong exclamation, question mark for the question). খ: In reported speech, verb tenses, pronouns and sentence structure change: direct questions become statements preceded by a reporting verb (exclaimed/asked + that/if), and quotation marks are removed. গ: A good apology is concise, takes responsibility, and offers a corrective action. ঘ: Common errors here are missing punctuation and missing apostrophes in contractions; both are fixed by adding the correct punctuation and punctuation marks.

Question:
At midnight my neighbor banged on the door and said angrily Turn that music down now Cant you see people are trying to sleep

Options:
ক. Rewrite the neighbor's complaint as properly punctuated direct speech.
খ. Express the neighbor's complaint in reported speech.
গ. Provide a short, polite response the musician could give immediately.
ঘ. Point out and correct two punctuation or capitalization errors from the original line.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "At midnight, my neighbor banged on the door and said angrily, \"Turn that music down now! Can't you see people are trying to sleep?\""

খ At midnight my neighbor banged on the door and angrily told me to turn the music down immediately, asking if I couldn't see that people were trying to sleep.

গ "I'm sorry — I'll lower the volume right away and keep it down."

ঘ Two corrections:
1) Cant → Can't (add apostrophe). Corrected to "Can't".
2) Missing punctuation for separate sentences/questions: add an exclamation mark after "now" and a question mark after the rhetorical question. Also, add a comma after the introductory phrase "At midnight," for clarity.

Explanation:
ক: Use quotation marks and proper sentence-ending punctuation: an exclamation for a command and a question mark for a question. A comma separates the reporting clause from the quoted speech. খ: Reported speech converts the command to an infinitive construction (told me to turn...) and rephrases the question as a subordinate clause. গ: A polite immediate response acknowledges the complaint and commits to action. ঘ: Common fixes include adding missing apostrophes in contractions, inserting appropriate punctuation marks, and using commas after introductory time/place phrases to clarify sentence structure.

Question:
When I returned to my room my elder sister glared at the scattered clothes and shouted Dont you care about keeping your things tidy Its disrespectful to leave your stuff all over the floor

Options:
ক. Put the sister's words into correct direct speech form with punctuation.
খ. Turn that direct speech into indirect speech.
গ. Compose a brief promise the speaker can give to reassure the sister.
ঘ. List two style or grammar improvements made when correcting the original sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "When I returned to my room, my elder sister glared at the scattered clothes and shouted, \"Don't you care about keeping your things tidy? It's disrespectful to leave your stuff all over the floor.\""

খ On returning to my room, my elder sister glared at the scattered clothes and shouted that I should care about keeping my things tidy and that it was disrespectful to leave my stuff all over the floor.

গ "I'm sorry. I will pick up all my clothes now and make sure I put things away after I use them from now on."

ঘ Two improvements made:
1) Added commas to separate introductory clauses (When I returned to my room, ...). This improves readability.
2) Corrected contractions and added question mark: Dont → Don't and added ? after the question to show it's a question.

Explanation:
ক: Direct speech must include quotation marks and appropriate punctuation for questions and statements. Also, introductory clauses are separated by commas. খ: In reported speech, the question form becomes a statement and quotation marks are removed; tense and pronoun adjustments may be required. গ: An effective promise acknowledges the issue and states a concrete corrective action. ঘ: Style improvements include proper punctuation (commas, question marks), correct use of contractions/apostrophes, and clearer sentence boundaries—these reduce ambiguity and show correct grammar.

Question:
On the terrace she said "I'm not very hungry but if you'd insist I could try a slice of the tart" I looked at the pastry "Would you like lemon or apple" I asked "Lemon" she said "No I never take tart with lemon" she corrected quickly

Options:
ক. Rewrite the passage correctly, fixing punctuation and capitalization.
খ. Identify three places where commas are required and explain why.
গ. Explain why some dialogue tags are lowercased after question marks and exclamation marks.
ঘ. Offer a brief stylistic edit to make the exchange sound friendlier (one or two sentences).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "On the terrace she said, \"I'm not very hungry, but if you'd insist I could try a slice of the tart.\" I looked at the pastry. \"Would you like lemon or apple?\" I asked. \"Lemon,\" she said. \"No, I never take tart with lemon,\" she corrected quickly." 

খ 1) After "she said" — a comma is needed to set off the dialogue tag from the narrative: "On the terrace she said, \"...\"." 2) Within the quoted speech "I'm not very hungry, but..." — a comma separates two independent clauses joined by 'but'. 3) After "Lemon," in the reply — a comma is required before the closing quotation mark when the tag "she said" follows: "Lemon,\" she said." 

গ When a quoted sentence ends with a question mark or exclamation point, the punctuation belongs to the quoted material and stays inside the quotation marks. The dialogue tag that follows is not a new sentence but a continuation that attributes the speech; thus it is lowercased: "What shall we do?" she asked. The question mark indicates the quoted sentence is complete; the tag is not capitalized because it is not beginning a separate sentence about a new action.

ঘ She smiled on the terrace. "I'm not very hungry, but if you insist, I'll try a slice of the tart." I peered at the choices. "Lemon or apple?" I asked. "Lemon," she replied, then added with a laugh, "no, actually — I never take tart with lemon."

Explanation:
This exercise focuses on comma placement and capitalization in dialogue. Commas separate clauses within sentences and set off dialogue tags. When a speaker's single-word answer is followed by a tag, a comma is placed before the closing quote. Question marks and exclamation marks remain inside quotes, and the following tag is lowercased because it serves to attribute the speech rather than start a new sentence. The stylistic edit adds small beats (smiled, peered) to soften the exchange and convey tone.

Question:
He offered the wine "Just a glass" she said "I never drink much but this looks nice" He poured a little "You'll like it" he promised "No thank you" she answered "Actually I'm driving"

Options:
ক. Rewrite the passage correctly, fixing punctuation and capitalization.
খ. Point out all instances where dialogue should be split into separate sentences and why.
গ. Describe how to punctuate a short interjection like "No thank you" when it stands alone.
ঘ. Rewrite the exchange in three concise sentences preserving meaning but improving clarity.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "He offered the wine. \"Just a glass,\" she said. \"I never drink much, but this looks nice.\" He poured a little. \"You'll like it,\" he promised. \"No, thank you,\" she answered. \"Actually, I'm driving.\"" 

খ Instances to split into separate sentences: 1) "He offered the wine" should be its own sentence to separate narrative action from speech. 2) Each quoted remark that expresses a complete thought should end with its own punctuation and closing quotation marks (e.g., "Just a glass," "I never drink much, but this looks nice."). 3) The reply "No, thank you" and the explanation "Actually, I'm driving" should be separate quoted sentences because they are distinct responses and the latter explains the reason — keeping them separate improves clarity and flow.

গ A short interjection like "No, thank you" is punctuated as a complete quoted sentence when it stands alone. Place a comma between "No" and "thank you" for natural speech pause: "No, thank you." If a dialogue tag follows, replace the period with a comma before the closing quotation mark: "No, thank you," she said. If an explanation follows in a new sentence, close the quote and start the next sentence separately: "No, thank you." "I'm driving." 

ঘ He offered the wine. "Just a glass," she said, "I never drink much, but this looks nice." He poured a little, but she declined. "No, thank you — actually, I'm driving."

Explanation:
The corrected version separates narrative and speech into distinct sentences and applies commas to set off dialogue tags and pauses. Splitting dialogue into separate sentences prevents run-ons and clarifies who speaks and when. Short interjections require commas for natural rhythm; if a dialogue tag follows, the comma goes inside the quotation marks. The concise rewrite preserves the original meaning while improving sentence boundaries and readability.

Question:
We sat at the bistro table. "I suppose I'll have the salad" she said "but only if it's dressed lightly" The waiter looked blank. "You want anything else?" he asked. "No thank you" I replied I just want coffee" She laughed "Coffee for both then"

Options:
ক. Rewrite the passage correctly, fixing punctuation and capitalization.
খ. List and number the specific punctuation or capitalization errors present in the original passage.
গ. Explain the rule(s) used to place commas and quotation marks in direct speech in English.
ঘ. Provide an alternative, more natural phrasing for the same exchange (two or three sentences).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "We sat at the bistro table.
\"I suppose I'll have the salad,\" she said, \"but only if it's dressed lightly.\" The waiter looked blank. \"Do you want anything else?\" he asked. \"No, thank you,\" I replied. \"I just want coffee.\" She laughed. \"Coffee for both, then.\"" 

খ 1) Missing commas before or after dialogue tags: e.g., before "she said" and before "he asked." 2) Missing closing quotation marks after some spoken sentences. 3) Incorrect capitalization after quotation marks ("No thank you" I replied I just want coffee"). 4) Run-on sentences where speech and tags were not separated by punctuation. 5) Missing commas in direct address and in compound phrases ("No, thank you," and "Coffee for both, then.").

গ Rules used: 1) When a sentence of direct speech is followed by a dialogue tag (he said, she asked, I replied), place a comma before the closing quotation mark if the speech would continue as a sentence: "I'm hungry," he said. 2) If the quoted speech ends with a question or exclamation, keep that punctuation and lowercase the following tag: "Are you coming?" she asked. 3) Start the first word of a quotation with a capital letter if the quotation is a complete sentence. 4) Place punctuation that belongs to the quoted sentence (comma, period, question mark, exclamation point) inside the quotation marks in American style. 5) Separate distinct sentences with appropriate sentence-ending punctuation and closing/opening quotation marks.

ঘ She smiled across the table. "I'll have the salad," she said, "but only if it's dressed lightly." The waiter paused. "Anything else?" he asked. "No, just coffee for both of us," I said, and she laughed.

Explanation:
The corrected passage follows standard dialogue punctuation: commas are used to separate quoted speech from dialogue tags, and each spoken sentence is enclosed in quotation marks. Errors in the original mainly involved omitted commas, missing closing quotation marks, and sentences run together without clear boundaries. In English dialogue, punctuation that ends the quoted sentence stays inside the quotation marks; a dialogue tag that follows a declarative speech uses a comma before the closing quote. The alternative phrasing aims for natural flow by breaking the exchange into complete sentences and adding brief narrative beats (smiled, paused) to make the conversation feel organic.

Question:
You: Good afternoon, Rafi. I missed you in class this morning.

Rafi: I skipped class because I thought the lecture wasn't important.

You: Most lectures build on earlier topics; missing them makes catching up harder.

Rafi: I know, but I had other things to do and I thought I could study the notes later.

You: Try attending and taking brief notes; if something is unclear you can ask the teacher after class.

Rafi: Alright, I'll attend tomorrow.

Options:
ক. Point out the sentence that shows you are concerned (quote it).
খ. Rewrite Rafi's first response to correct casual phrasing into a formal sentence.
গ. Compose a concise persuasive message (2–3 sentences) you can send to Rafi tonight encouraging him to come to class.
ঘ. Explain three likely academic consequences if Rafi continues to skip lectures.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক "I missed you in class this morning." (This sentence shows concern about Rafi's absence.)

খ Informal: "I skipped class because I thought the lecture wasn't important." Formal rewrite: "I missed the lecture because I believed it would not be important."

গ "Please try to attend tomorrow's lecture — missing class makes understanding later topics harder. If you have trouble, we can review the notes together after class."

ঘ 1) Gaps in understanding: He may miss foundational explanations, making later topics confusing. 2) Lower grades: Missing lectures often leads to poorer performance on quizzes and exams due to missed information and examples. 3) Increased workload and stress: He'll need extra time to self-study and catch up, which can reduce available time for assignments and rest.

Explanation:
ক: The quoted line directly communicates concern about absence. খ: The formal rewrite replaces casual verbs and contractions to produce a more formal tone while preserving meaning. গ: The message is short, respectful, and offers concrete support, increasing the chance Rafi will attend. ঘ: The three consequences are common and evidence-based effects of skipping instructional time: learning gaps, grade impact, and additional catch-up burden.

Question:
Friend: Hey Ali, why didn't you finish your assignment?

Ali: I kept checking my phone and scrolling through social media. Time flew by.

Friend: You could set a timer and put your phone away.

Ali: I tried, but I keep getting distracted by messages.

Friend: Maybe try turning off notifications or using an app blocker while studying.

Ali: That's a good idea. I'll try it.

Options:
ক. Identify the main cause of Ali's problem in a single phrase.
খ. Rewrite Ali's second line to make it grammatically correct and concise.
গ. If Ali studies for 6 hours out of 24 hours, what percentage of the day does he study? Show the calculation using [math] [/math] tags.
ঘ. List three specific steps Ali can take right now to reduce phone distractions.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Excessive smartphone/social-media distraction.

খ "I kept checking my phone and scrolling through social media, so time flew by."

গ Calculation: [math]\frac{6}{24} \times 100 = 25\%[/math]. So Ali studies 25% of the day.

ঘ 1) Turn on Do Not Disturb and disable non-essential notifications while studying.
2) Place the phone in another room or inside a drawer while doing focused work.
3) Use an app-blocker to block social apps for set study periods (e.g., 50 minutes study, 10 minutes break).

Explanation:
ক: The dialogue shows the root cause is smartphone/social-media use, which interrupts tasks. খ: I combined Ali's clauses into a single clear sentence, keeping his meaning. গ: The percentage uses a simple fraction-to-percent conversion; enclosing the math in [math] tags as requested. ঘ: The three steps are concrete and low-effort policies that remove temptation and create structure for focused study.

Question:
Myself: Good evening, Sana. You look tired.

Sana: Yes, I sleep very late and wake up late for classes.

Myself: That must be affecting your performance.

Sana: I feel sleepy in class and forget what I studied.

Myself: Try to sleep earlier and take short breaks while studying.

Sana: I will try. Thank you.

Options:
ক. Rewrite the dialogue with correct punctuation and capitalization.
খ. Explain in one sentence why Sana's performance is suffering.
গ. Give two practical pieces of advice Sana can follow starting tonight.
ঘ. Write a polite short reminder (one sentence) you could send Sana tomorrow morning.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Myself: Good evening, Sana. You look tired.

Sana: Yes, I sleep very late and wake up late for classes.

Myself: That must be affecting your performance.

Sana: I feel sleepy in class and forget what I studied.

Myself: Try to sleep earlier and take short breaks while studying.

Sana: I will try. Thank you.


খ Sana's performance is suffering because late nights and irregular sleep make her sleepy in class, reducing concentration and memory retention.

গ 1) Go to bed 30–60 minutes earlier tonight and keep a consistent sleep time each night; avoid screens 30 minutes before sleep. 2) Use the Pomodoro technique while studying (25 minutes focused study, 5 minutes break) to improve concentration and prevent fatigue.

ঘ "Good morning Sana — hope you slept well; remember to wake up on time for your first class and avoid using your phone before bed."

Explanation:
ক: I corrected capitalization and punctuation while keeping the original sentences intact. খ: Poor sleep reduces alertness and the ability to form and recall memories, so she cannot follow lessons or remember studied material. গ: The two tips are practical and immediately actionable — earlier consistent sleep addresses the root cause, and Pomodoro breaks maintain focus. ঘ: The reminder is short, polite and actionable, reinforcing the advice at a relevant time.
