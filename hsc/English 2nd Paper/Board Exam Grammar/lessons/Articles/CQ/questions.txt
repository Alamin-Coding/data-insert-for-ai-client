Correct Answer: 

Solution:

Explanation:
Explanation: Use "a" for one non‑specific item, "the" for something specific or unique, and no article when a possessive (like "their") already marks the noun. Thus (a) is "a" because "skill" is introduced generally; (b) is "the" because "the art of writing" is a specific invention; (c) is "the" and (d) is "a" ("the general people", "a privilege"); (e) is "the" in "the chosen few"; (g) and (h) are "the" in "the running of the state." Finally, (i) is "The" for "The Greeks", and (j) needs no article because "their" already shows possession ("their male children").

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
slove add kora lagbe

Explanation:
Explanation:
a Use "an" because "ideal" begins with a vowel sound.  
b Use "an" because "affectionate" begins with a vowel sound.  
c Use "her" to show the family she specifically manages (possessive).  
d Use "the" in the fixed phrase "the cost of her own life" (a specific cost).  
e Use "a" because the idiom is "a wink of sleep" (any small amount of sleep).  
f Use "the" with "poor" to mean poor people as a group ("the poor").  
g Use "a" because "very" starts with a consonant sound, so "a very religious lady."  
h Use "the" for a specific route or way: "the path of truth and honesty."  
i Use "A" because we mean "a woman like her" (one such woman).  
j Use "a" before "good moral character" because it's a singular, countable noun phrase.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
slove add kora lagbe

Explanation:
Explanation:
(a) "an" — use "an" before the vowel sound of "HSC" (pronounced "aitch‑es‑see"), so "an HSC examinee" is correct.
(b) "very" — "attentive to" needs a degree word; "very attentive to" correctly strengthens the adjective.
(c) (no article) — names of languages normally take no article, so "weak in English" (not "the English").
(d) "quite" — "quite lazy" is a natural degree modifier; it correctly describes the extent of his laziness.
(e) "more" — in the phrase "is no more" (or "no more prepared") "more" completes the negative comparison meaning "not any further/adequate."
(f) "a" — singular countable noun "short suggestion" needs the indefinite article "a."
(g) "on the" — the fixed phrase is "on the day (of the) examination."
(h) "a" — "a bit earlier" is the correct idiom to indicate a small amount of time earlier.
(i) "the" — "the examination hall" refers to a specific place, so use the definite article.
(j) "a" — "a trembling heart" is an indefinite noun phrase describing his state as he entered.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
slvoe add kora lagbe

Explanation:
Use "a" before a singular countable noun introduced for the first time, so (a) "a poor cobbler" and (b) "a rich neighbor." Use "the" for a specific person already mentioned and for superlatives, so (c) "the neighbour" and (g)/(h)/(i) "the richest," "the happiest," "the world." Use "an" before words beginning with a vowel sound, so (e) and (f) are "an angry man" and "an unhappy man," and leave blanks where no article is needed with uncountable nouns or after a possessive, so (d) and (j) are left without an article.

However, some people prefer (g) — electronic media to reading (h) — newspaper. But (i) — newspaper offers more to its readers than (j) — electronic media.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: Use a "an" because "unmixed" begins with a vowel sound, and b "the" because "most" is a superlative that needs "the".  
Use c "a" for "a day" (any single day) and d "the" because it refers to the specific newspaper one reads.  
Use e "the" in "one of the good habits", f "a" for a single frog, and g, h, i, j "the" because we are referring to the specific/known media or making a particular comparison.

To prevent (i) — nuisance caused by mosquitoes, we have to be alert and work in (j) — assorted efforts.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
slove add kora lagbe

Explanation:
Use "the" at a because a superlative ("most talked-about") requires the definite article: "the most talked-about topics." Use "the" at b and c because they refer to a specific concept already introduced ("the fear... = the mosquito menace"), and use "a" at e because "constant nuisance" is a singular countable noun. No article is needed before general plurals or fixed expressions—so (d) "city dwellers", (f) "at night", (g) "us", and (j) "assorted efforts" take no article—while (h) and (i) use "the" because they refer to a particular attack/nuisance already mentioned.

The blank i needs no extra word because "closely resembled" is already complete, and j is filled by "who was" to form the relative clause "he thought that it was his father who was inside it."

Also, "a must" is the idiomatic expression for necessity, "one's life" shows possession, and "certain misfortune" is the natural collocation meaning an inevitable bad result.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: Use articles and set phrases correctly: (a) and (j) take "an" because "idle" and "obese" begin with vowel sounds; (c) and (f) take "a" because "European" (y‑sound) and "heavy" begin with consonant sounds. Use "the" for specific, already mentioned people ((d) the doctor, (e) the man). (b) is the fixed phrase "as a result", (g) is "the air" in this context, (h) is the adjective "tired" (no article), and (i) is the adjective "thin" describing the result.

Similar is (j)____case with Bangladesh.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
(a) "a large" and (b) "serious" — "a large number of" is the common phrase for many, and "serious" describes the kind of problems.  
(c) "the" and (d) "the" — we use "the population problem" and "the most acute" because we mean a specific problem among those mentioned.  
(e) "a" and (f) "the" — "a great asset" is the correct indefinite phrase, while "the country" refers to Bangladesh already identified.  
(g) "the", (h) "any" and (i) "a" — "the country" (specific), "any suitable jobs" shows absence of jobs, and "a burden" is the correct indefinite noun phrase.  
(j) "the" — "the case" is the fixed expression meaning the situation is the same for Bangladesh.

Use no article before most proper place names: names like Jigatola, Rifles Square, Bonogram Lane, BCC Road, Renkin Street, Bangabhaban and Baldha Garden are specific names, so they normally take no article.

Use "the" for (a), (b), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j) because they refer to a specific or definite thing (the name, the recognised title "Rebel Poet", the First World War, the army he joined, that war, the oppressed as a definite group, the Shelley comparison, the Bangalees and the War of Liberation). Use "a" for (c) because "born in a poor family" refers to one nonspecific family among many. Thus: (a) the; (b) the; (c) a; (d) the; (e) the; (f) the; (g) the; (h) the; (i) the; (j) the.

These choices follow article and adjective rules: use "a"/"A" for a single, non‑specific item ((a),(b),(g)); use "the" for specific things or fixed expressions ((d),(f),(h),(j)); "sound" and "healthy" are adjectives describing "mentality" and "environment"; and "nature" is usually used without an article when spoken of in general.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation:
a "a well-known" is needed because we use an article + adjective before "known fact". b "an" is used before the vowel sound in "international". c "the" refers to that particular language used by the international community.

d "their" shows possession for the people whose first language it is. e "a" fits the phrase "a second language". f "an" indicates one of the official languages in many countries. g "the" refers to the specific former official language of our country.

h "the" points to that particular group of books. i "its" shows possession ("its importance"). j "a" completes the idiom "a must".

Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:

Question:
A brilliant student is (a) —------ asset. One day he may be (b)——----engineer or (c)—–----M.B.B.S.doctor. He makes (d)—–---best use of his time. He makes a proper division of his time and does his duties accordingly. He knows that youth is (e)—----golden period of (f) —----- life. He has (g) -----— aim in life. He knows that (h) -–---life without (i) -----— aim is like (j) -------— ship without a rudder.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Use "a valuable" for (a) because "valuable asset" is the correct collocation.  
Use "an" for (b) and (c) since "engineer" and "M.B.B.S." begin with vowel sounds, and "the" for (d) in "the best use"; use "the" and "his" for (e) and (f) to form "the golden period of his life."  
Use "a definite" for (g) to show a clear aim, "that" for (h) to introduce the clause, "an" for (i) before the vowel sound in "aim," and "a" for (j) in the general simile "a ship without a rudder."

Question:
(a) —---–idle man and (b) ----—–active man cannot be equal. We know (c)—–story of (d) —---–ant and (e)–------grasshopper, (f)-----ant was industrious. On the other hand, the grasshopper was really (g) ---—–lazy. The ant knew that (h) —–----industrious shine. On (i)——–contrary, (j) —---–lazy suffer in life.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Use 'an' for (a) and (b) because 'idle' and 'active' begin with vowel sounds, so we say "an idle man" and "an active man." Use 'the' for (c), (d), (e), (f), (h) and (j) because we refer to specific, known characters or groups (the story, the ant, the grasshopper, the industrious/the lazy). Use 'very' for (g) to intensify "lazy," and 'on the contrary' for (i) because that fixed phrase expresses contrast.

Explanation: Use "an" before a vowel sound, so (a) is "an important role"; use "a" for non-specific singular nouns, so (c) "a day", (d) "a good habit" and (h) "a dark well". Use "the" with superlatives and definite references, so (b) "the most useful" and (i)/(j) "the looking glass of the modern world", and use the correlative comparative "the... the..." for (e) and (f).

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: Use definite article "the" for specific, known items and names, indefinite "a/an" for one non‑specific item, and the zero article (no article) after words like "each" or with number expressions. So the answers are: (a) the, (b) the, (c) a, (d) (no article), (e) the, (f) (no article), (g) (no article), (h) a, (i) an, (j) a — because "the great poet" and "the Shahnama" are specific, "a piece" is any single piece, "each" and "sixty thousand" take no article, and "an" precedes a vowel sound in "aggrieved."

On the other hand (f)–rich man should have (g) ——---  sympathy for (h) ——--- poor there is difference between (i)——-- poor man and (j) ——--- rich man.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Use [math]"by"[/math] because the clause is passive ("liked by even an idiot") and [math]"an"[/math] before a vowel sound ("an idiot"). Use [math]"the"[/math] to talk about definite groups ("the educated and the uneducated", "the poor", "the rich"), omit any extra word between "educated" and "person" ("An educated person"), and use [math]"some"[/math] for an indefinite amount of sympathy. So the blanks are: (a) by, (b) an, (c) the, (d) — (no word), (e) the, (f) the, (g) some, (h) the, (i) the, (j) the.

Explanation:
Answers: (a) our, (b) a, (c) some, (d) the, (e) a, (f) a, (g) her, (h) the, (i) a, (j) the helpless.

These fit because "our" shows whose way it was; "a" is the indefinite article for a singular noun ("a little girl", "a flower", "a ten taka note"); "some" is used for an indefinite plural ("some flowers"); "the" is used for a specific or familiar noun ("the street", the fixed phrase "the sight"); "her" shows the mother's possession of the affection; and "the helpless" uses "the" to refer to a particular group (people who are helpless).

"As a result" is a fixed phrase for (b); (c) = "a European doctor" because "European" begins with a consonant sound (/j/); (d) and (e) = "the" to refer back to the specific doctor and man; (f) = "a heavy club" (nonspecific); (g) = "the air" (the specific medium); (h) and (i) need no article ("till he got tired," "he became thin").

Use "the" for specific references—e.g. "the writer", "the limitations", "the only enemy", and "the country" when a particular entity is meant.

In (h) ———-sense, you must evaluate (i)——— subject-matter itself to (j) ———-determine if it is appropriate for your objectives.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
"an" is correct for (a) because "initial" begins with a vowel sound and takes an indefinite article; "varying" fits (b) since it describes differences in students' interests, abilities, and adjustment.  
"The" is appropriate for (c), (e), (f), and (g) because these nouns (the selection, the evaluation process, the techniques, the subject-matter) are specific and definite; "integral parts" needs no extra word between "integral" and "parts."  
"This" in (h) is idiomatic ("in this sense"), "the" in (i) specifies the particular subject-matter to be assessed, and "to determine" in (j) correctly expresses the purpose of the evaluation.

Question:
Providing enough energy to meet (a) ————ever-increasing demand is one of (b)———— gravest problems (c)----—world is now facing. Energy is (d)———— key to (e) ——– industrialized economy, which calls for (f)———– doubling of electrical output every ten to twelve years. Meanwhile (g) ———– days of cheap abundant and environmentally acceptable power may be coming to (h)———end. Coal is plentiful but polluting, natural gas is (i)———–scarce, oil is not found everywhere. Nuclear power now appears (j)————-costly and risky.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: 

For (a), (b), (c), (d) and (g) the definite article "the" is required because they refer to specific, known things ("the ever-increasing demand", "one of the gravest problems the world is now facing", "the key", "the days"). For (e) use "an" before the vowel sound in "industrialized", and for (f) use "a" because "doubling" is a single event ("a doubling"). For (i) "becoming" correctly shows a change of state ("is becoming scarce"), and for (j) "increasingly" modifies the adjectives to show the rising degree of cost and risk.

Question:
Cellular radio telephone, also called cellular telephone or cell phone provides voice telephone and other services to (a)———–mobile users. Cellular telephones primarily operate like portable or cordless telephones. However, unlike conventional wire-based cordless phones, cell phones are completely portable and do not require (b) ————jack to access (c) ————-wire-based networks operated by local telephone companies, (d)————– new generation of services for cell phones include video conferencing and (e)——– internet access with (f) ———— ability to send e-mail. Cellular telephones have become very popular with (g) —————professionals and (h)———-consumers as (i)———–way to communicate easily. It has been (j)————–alternative to conventional wire-based services.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Correct answers (in context): (a) many, (b) a telephone, (c) the, (d) The, (e) wireless, (f) the, (g) business, (h) ordinary, (i) an easy, (j) a viable.  
Explanation: "many" fits because cell phones serve large numbers of mobile users; "a telephone jack" and "the wire-based networks" fit logically since wired phones need a physical jack to reach local networks. "The new generation" properly introduces newer services, and "wireless internet access with the ability to send e‑mail" describes those features. Finally, "business professionals and ordinary consumers" names typical users, "an easy way" explains the communication purpose, and "a viable alternative" indicates cell phones serve as a practical substitute for wired service.

To save money he wanted to make (i)——–vegetable garden in front of his house. But (j)——-land was full of ants and land-crabs. They foiled all his attempts.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: The blanks require correct articles and determiners. (a) Use "an" before the vowel sound in "American." (b) Use "a" because "story" is a singular countable noun ("a short story"). (c) Use "a" for the indefinite "a wonderful piece." (d) No article is needed before the proper name "Tahiti" ("in Tahiti"). (e) The phrase is idiomatic: "short of money" takes no determiner. (f) Use "a" for "a one-room house" (one begins with a consonant sound). (g) Use "the" in "the nearest town" because it refers to a specific town relative to his house. (h) Use "some" with the uncountable noun "writing" ("some interesting writing"). (i) Use "a" for the singular countable "a vegetable garden." (j) Use "the" for "the land" since it refers to the specific land already mentioned.

Explanation:
Man is called a rational creature because he has the capacity for reason, abstract thought and moral judgment; this rationality, rather than physical features, distinguishes humans as a separate species. Because humans can discern right from wrong and act on moral understanding, they are often regarded as the finest of the Creator’s creations.

The correct words are: (a) a valuable, (b) an, (c) an, (d) the best, (e) the, (f) his, (g) a definite, (h) a, (i) an, (j) a.  
Article rules: use "a/an" for non-specific singular nouns ("an" before a vowel sound), "the" for a specific or unique phrase ("the best", "the golden period"), and "his" for possession.  
"Definite" qualifies the noun "aim," and the final phrase uses the common metaphor "a life without an aim is like a ship without a rudder" to show purpose is necessary.

Solution:


Explanation:
Explanation: The blanks are filled to show a contrast — use "an" before the vowel-starting adjectives ("an idle man" and "an active man"), and use "the" for the specific characters in the fable ("the ant" and "the grasshopper"). The adjectives "industrious" (for the ant) and "lazy" (for the grasshopper) express the moral: industrious people prosper while lazy people suffer.

Use "a" for a single unspecified item—so (c) a (piece of gold), (h) a (broken heart) and (j) a (blunder); use "an" before a vowel sound—so (i) an (aggrieved man).

Use the indefinite article "a" before a singular countable noun with a consonant sound ("a worse state") and "an" before a word with a vowel sound ("an increase," "an overwhelming environmental catastrophe").

গ. (c) ফাঁক পূরণ করুন — কোন article/pronounটি উপযুক্ত?
ঘ. (d) ফাঁক পূরণ করুন — কোন articleটি উপযুক্ত?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "an"
- কারণ: অনেক ইংরেজি শব্দের মধ্যে "annual" শব্দটি স্বরবর্ণ-শব্দ (vowel sound) দিয়ে শুরু করে (এখানে 'a' না বলে 'an' ব্যবহার করতে হয়)।

খ উত্তর: "an"
- কারণ: এখানে "easy production" একটি singular noun phrase; "easy" শব্দটি স্বরবর্ণ-শব্দের মতো মনে হলেও ব্যবহারের নিয়ম অনুযায়ী singular countable noun-এর আগে "an" লাগে ("an easy production") এবং বাক্যে বিরোধী অর্থে ব্যবহার করলেও আর্টিকেল অপরিবর্তিত থাকে: "it will not be an easy production." 

গ উত্তর: "the"
- কারণ: "the scenes" এখানে নির্দিষ্ট দৃশ্যগুলোকে নির্দেশ করে (production-এর নির্দিষ্ট scenes), তাই নির্দিষ্ট আর্টিকেল "the" ব্যবহার করা উচিত।

ঘ উত্তর: "the"
- কারণ: ইংরেজিতে স্থায়ী অভিব্যক্তি "from the very beginning" প্রচলিত; এখানে "the" প্রয়োজন কারণ "very beginning" একটি নির্দিষ্ট সময়কাল নির্দেশ করে।

Explanation:
প্রতিটি নির্বাচন English article/use-এর সাধারণ নিয়ম মেনে করা হয়েছে: (ক) এবং (খ)-এ শব্দগুলি স্বরবর্ণ-শব্দের সাথে শুরু হওয়ায় "an" ব্যবহার উপযোগী; (গ)-এ নির্দিষ্ট সীনের কথা বলা হয়েছে তাই "the" লাগে; (ঘ)-এও স্থায়ী ফ্রেজ "from the very beginning" এ নির্দিষ্ট আর্টিকেল প্রয়োজন।

গ. (c) ফাঁক পূরণ করুন — কোন determinerটি উপযুক্ত?
ঘ. (d) ফাঁক পূরণ করুন — কোন prepositionটি উপযুক্ত?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "an"
- কারণ: "umbrella" শব্দের শুরুতে স্বরবর্ণ-ধ্বনি আছে, তাই অনান্য ইংরেজি নিয়ম অনুযায়ী "an umbrella" হবে।

খ উত্তর: "an"
- কারণ: "unnecessary" শব্দটি স্বরবর্ণ-ধ্বনির সঙ্গে শুরু হওয়ায় "an unnecessary luggage"—তবে সাধারণ কথায় আমরা বলি "unnecessary luggage" (zero article) ও হতে পারে; কিন্তু প্রশ্নের কাঠামোতে যদি একটি article বসাতে হয়, সেক্ষেত্রে "an unnecessary" সঠিক হবে।

গ উত্তর: "a few"
- কারণ: "few"-এর আগে যখন সংখ্যা বা পরিমাণ বোঝাতে ব্যবহার করি এবং গুণগত দিক দিয়ে অনুকূল অর্থে বলতে চাই (কয়েকটা প্রয়োজনীয় জিনিস), তখন "a few" ব্যবহার করা হয়; "few" (without 'a') হলে নেতিবাচক অর্থ ফেলে।

ঘ উত্তর: "by"
- কারণ: পরিবহনে কোন মাধ্যম ব্যবহার করা হচ্ছে তা প্রকাশ করতে ইংরেজিতে "by train", "by bus" ইত্যাদি ব্যবহার করা হয়; সুতরাং "Travelling by train" সঠিক।

Explanation:
এই advisory-তে article ও determiners-বিষয়ক সাধারণ নিয়ম প্রযোজ্য: স্বরবর্ণ-ধ্বনি দিয়ে শুরু হলে 'an', নির্দিষ্ট পারিবহন মাধ্যমের আগে 'by', পরিমাপ/সংখ্যা বোঝাতে 'a few' ইত্যাদি। (খ)-এর ক্ষেত্রে কথ্যভাবে article না-ও দেওয়া যেতে পারে, তবে প্রশ্নের ফ্রেম অনুযায়ী 'an' যুক্ত করলে উপরের ব্যাখ্যা প্রযোজ্য।

Options:

ঘ. (d) ফাঁক পূরণ করুন — কোন prepositionটি উপযুক্ত?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "a"
- কারণ: "balanced diet" এখানে এক ধরণের সাধারণ, countable-conceptual diet বোঝাচ্ছে; "a balanced diet" হল স্বাভাবিক এবং প্রচলিত ব্যবহার।

খ উত্তর: "an"
- কারণ: "excessive" শব্দটি স্বরবর্ণ-ধ্বনি দিয়ে শুরু করে, ফলে "an excessive intake" শব্দগুচ্ছটি সঠিক; বাক্যটিতে "avoid an excessive intake of sugar" বলা যায়।

গ উত্তর: "on a"
- কারণ: ইংরেজিতে অভিজ্ঞতা-ভিত্তিক ধারাবাহিকতা প্রকাশ করতে "on a regular basis" ব্যবহার করা হয় ("in a regular basis" ভুল)। তাই "Exercise on a regular basis" সঠিক।

ঘ উত্তর: "for"
- কারণ: ঘুমের সময়কাল বা পরিমাণ নির্দেশ করার ক্ষেত্রে সাধারণত বলা হয় "sleep for adequate hours" বা "sleep for eight hours"; এখানে "for" উপযুক্ত প্রিপোজিশন।

Explanation:
উপরের প্রতিটি ফাঁকের জন্য article এবং preposition-সংক্রান্ত সাধারণ ইংরেজি নিয়ম প্রয়োগ করা হয়েছে: (ক) অনির্দিষ্ট article 'a' ব্যবহৃত—পাঠ্যভিত্তিক, (খ) 'excessive' শব্দটির আগে 'an' লাগে কারণ এটি স্বরবর্ণ-শব্দ দিয়ে শুরু করে, (গ) "on a regular basis" হচ্ছে স্ট্যান্ডার্ড অভিধানিক ফ্রেজ, (ঘ) সময়ে 'for' ব্যবহারে ঘুমের ঘণ্টা প্রকাশ করা হয়।

ক. ক: উপযুক্ত শব্দটি বসান (a/an/the/—)?
খ. খ: উপযুক্ত বিশেষণ বা শব্দটি বসান?
গ. গ: উপযুক্ত নিবন্ধ (article) বসান (a/an/the/—)?
ঘ. ঘ: উপযুক্ত বাক্যাংশ বসান (most/very/the most/etc.)?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: a

খ উত্তর: serious

গ উত্তর: the

ঘ উত্তর: the most pressing

Explanation:
ক — 'a large number of' একটি স্থাপিত শব্দগুচ্ছ; এখানে 'a' ব্যবহৃত হয় কারণ 'large number' একক পরিমাপের আগে অনির্দিষ্ট আর্টিকেল প্রয়োজন।

খ — 'serious' বিশেষণের মাধ্যমে সমস্যাগুলোকে বর্ণনা করা হচ্ছে; অর্থাৎ 'serious problems' প্রাকৃতিকভাবে ব্যবহারযোগ্য ও অর্থবহ।

গ — যেহেতু আমরা নির্দিষ্ট একটি সমস্যা ('sanitation problem') সম্পর্কে কথা বলছি যা আগের অংশে উল্লিখিত, তাই 'the' ব্যবহার করা হয়।

ঘ — সর্বনামক পর্যায়ে 'most pressing' হল সর্বোচ্চ শ্রেণির তুলনামূলক শব্দ; সুপারলেটিভ ব্যবহারে সাধারণত 'the most ...' লাগে, তাই 'the most pressing' সঠিক।

Question:
Education remains (ক) — key to national progress in Bangladesh. However (খ) — literacy gap between urban and rural areas remains (গ) — worrying. Addressing (ঘ) — gap will require coordinated policies across sectors.

Options:
ক. ক: উপযুক্ত নিবন্ধ বসান (a/an/the/—)?
খ. খ: কোন শব্দটি সঠিক (a/the/this/—)?
গ. গ: কোন আর্টিকেল বা শব্দ লাগবে (a/an/the/very/etc.)?
ঘ. ঘ: কোন নির্দেশক সর্বনাম লাগবে (this/that/the/—)?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: a

খ উত্তর: the

গ উত্তর: a

ঘ উত্তর: this

Explanation:
ক — 'a key' হল সংগতিপূর্ণ কারণ 'key' এখানে একটি সাধারণ ভূমিকা নির্দেশ করে; 'Education remains a key to...' প্রচলিত ব্যবহার।

খ — 'the literacy gap' নির্দিষ্ট পটভূমিতে (urban vs rural) উল্লেখিত ব্যবধান বোঝানোর জন্য নির্দিষ্ট আর্টিকেল 'the' প্রয়োজন।

গ — 'remains a worrying' তে 'a' প্রয়োজন কারণ 'worrying' একটি বিশেষণযুক্ত বস্তুকে নির্দেশ করছে ('a worrying gap')।

ঘ — পূর্বে উল্লেখিত বিরাট ব্যবধানকে পুনরায় নির্দেশ করতে 'this gap' ব্যবহার উপযুক্ত; এটি পাঠকের সামনে আসা নির্দিষ্ট বিষয়টি সঠিকভাবে নির্দেশ করে।

Rural employment in Bangladesh offers (ক) — mixture of opportunities and challenges for households. In many districts (খ) — agricultural sector remains (গ) — primary source of income, while (ঘ) — informal sector provides seasonal and supplemental work.

Options:
ক. ক: কোন আর্টিকেল ব্যবহার করবেন (a/an/the/—)?
খ. খ: আর্টিকেল প্রয়োজন কি (a/the/—)?
গ. গ: কোন শব্দটি উপযুক্ত (a/the/main/—)?
ঘ. ঘ: কোন নির্দেশক বা আর্টিকেল লাগবে (the/this/—)?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: a

খ উত্তর: the

গ উত্তর: the

ঘ উত্তর: the informal sector

Explanation:
ক — 'a mixture' ব্যবহার করা হয় কারণ এখানে সাধারণভাবে বিভিন্ন ধরনের সুযোগ-চ্যালেঞ্জের জটিল মিশ্রণ বোঝানো হচ্ছে; অনির্দিষ্ট আর্টিকেল 'a' সঠিক।

খ — যখন নির্দিষ্ট ভূ-অঞ্চল (many districts) প্রসঙ্গে 'agricultural sector' বলা হচ্ছে এবং সেটি প্রসঙ্গে নির্দিষ্টভাবে ব্যবহৃত হচ্ছে, তখন 'the' ব্যবহার উপযুক্ত: 'In many districts the agricultural sector...'.

গ — 'the primary source' ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে কারণ এটি প্রধান উৎস হিসেবে নির্দিষ্টকরণ করছে; সুতরাং 'the' দরকার।

ঘ — এখানে আমরা নির্দিষ্ট খাত ('informal sector') সম্পর্কে বলছি যা বাক্যের পূর্বাংশের ধারাবাহিক অংশ; সাধারণত 'the informal sector' ব্যবহার করে সেটি উপস্থাপন করা হয়।

Question:
Complete the passages below by filling each blank with the correct article or determiner (a, an, the, some, any, no, many, much, few, little) so the sentences read naturally.

Options:
ক. (a) _____ elephant is (b) _____ large mammal. (c) _____ African elephant is (d) _____ largest land animal. In (e) _____ wild they travel in herds and eat (f) _____ variety of plants.
খ. (a) There was (b) _____ honest student in the class who always did (c) _____ best. (d) _____ teacher praised him for (e) _____ effort.
গ. (a) _____ apple a day keeps (b) _____ doctor away, they say. (c) _____ fruit contains (d) _____ vitamins and (e) _____ fiber.
ঘ. (a) She bought (b) _____ umbrella because (c) _____ sky looked cloudy. (d) She also carried (e) _____ small towel.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) An (b) a (c) The (d) the (e) the (f) a
খ (a) an (b) an (c) her (d) The (e) her
গ (a) An (b) the (c) The (d) many / some (e) some / a little (either appropriate depending on emphasis)
ঘ (a) an (b) an (c) the (d) a (e) a small / some

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'An' before vowel sound 'elephant'. (b) 'a' before consonant 'large' describing one member of class. (c,d) 'The' because we refer to a specific known species (African elephant) and then the unique title 'the largest'. (e) 'the wild' refers to a known environment (in the wild). (f) 'a variety' uses the indefinite article with 'variety' meaning 'a range of'.

খ: (a) 'an' before vowel sound 'honest' (silent h). (b) 'an' again before vowel. (c) 'her' is appropriate because we refer to the student's own best effort; 'the best' could also be used if intended generally. (d) 'The teacher' — definite because a specific teacher is meant. (e) 'her effort' — matches the student referenced.

গ: (a) 'An' before vowel sound 'apple'. (b) 'the doctor' is a fixed idiom: "keeps the doctor away." (c) 'The fruit' can be 'Fruit' in general — both 'Fruit contains' (zero article) or 'The fruit contains' if referring to fruit in the proverb. (d) 'many' or 'some' vitamins (countable/uncountable choice): 'many vitamins' is common. (e) 'some fiber' or 'a little fiber' (fiber is uncountable), both acceptable depending on emphasis.

ঘ: (a) 'an' before vowel sound 'umbrella' (note: 'an umbrella' — some speakers use 'a' if pronounced with a consonant-like glide, but standard is 'an'). (b) 'an' before 'umbrella' repeated? Here (b) is redundant; interpreted as 'an umbrella' if sentence structure repeated. (c) 'the sky' — definite because it's the sky above. (d) 'a' small towel (one of many). (e) 'a small' or 'some' towel — 'a small towel' is natural. 

Notes: Several blanks admit more than one correct determiner depending on nuance (e.g., 'some' vs 'many', 'the fruit' vs 'fruit' in general). I gave the most natural, commonly accepted choices and explained alternatives where applicable.

Question:
Fill the blanks in these short narratives with suitable articles, demonstratives, or quantifiers so the meaning becomes precise and natural.

Options:
ক. (a) I saw (b) _____ unusual bird in (c) _____ garden yesterday. (d) _____ bird had (e) _____ bright red feathers.
খ. (a) He needs (b) _____ hour to finish (c) _____ report. (d) He will take (e) _____ short break.

ঘ. (a) (b) _____ book on (c) _____ table belongs to (d) _____ student sitting by the window. (e) _____ book is full of notes.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) an (b) an (c) the (d) The (e) some / striking bright red feathers
খ (a) an (b) an (c) the (d) a (e) a short
গ (a) any / no (b) any (c) the (d) some / a couple of (e) the
ঘ (a) The / That (b) The / That (c) the (d) the (e) The / That

Explanation:
ক: (a,b) 'an unusual bird' — 'unusual' begins with a vowel sound; repeat 'an' if structure needs it. (c) 'the garden' — a particular garden (context: one already known or visible). (d) 'The bird' definite because it's the one just mentioned. (e) 'some bright red feathers' — 'some' quantifies uncountable or plural attribute; 'striking' is an optional adjective.

খ: (a,b) 'He needs an hour...' — 'hour' begins with vowel sound. (c) 'the report' — specific report being discussed. (d) 'a short break' — indefinite single break; (e) 'a short' is shorthand but 'a short break' more natural.

গ: (a) When asking about absence, 'There isn't any milk left' or 'There is no milk left'—both correct. (b) 'any' fits negative/question contexts for uncountable nouns. (c) 'the fridge' — the specific fridge you share. (d) 'some liters' or 'a couple of liters' — number needed; 'some' is natural. (e) 'the market' — a known market in context.

ঘ: Use definite demonstratives because we point to a specific book: (a,b) 'That book on the table belongs to the student...' or 'The book on the table belongs...' (c) 'the table' — specific. (d) 'the student' — the one specified by position. (e) 'The book is full of notes' — definite reference. 

Notes: Several blanks can accept more than one correct determiner depending on the context and emphasis (e.g., 'some' vs 'a couple of', 'any' vs 'no'). I have chosen the most idiomatic choices and indicated alternatives.

Question:
Complete the short informational snippets using appropriate articles, quantifiers, or demonstratives so that the facts read correctly.

Options:
ক. (a) _____ Internet has changed (b) _____ way we access information. (c) In (d) _____ early days, (e) _____ connection was (f) _____ dial-up link.
খ. (a) _____ research shows that (b) _____ regular exercise reduces (c) _____ risk of many diseases. (d) Even (e) _____ small amount each day helps.

ঘ. (a) In (b) _____ experiment, scientists used (c) _____ sample of (d) _____ cells and observed (e) _____ change after (f) several hours.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) The (b) the (c) the (d) the (e) the (f) a / an (a dial-up link — use 'a')
খ (a) Research / The research (b) regular (c) the / a (d) Even (e) a / a small
গ (a) a (b) a (c) the (d) The (e) The (f) very
ঘ (a) the (b) the (c) a (d) the (e) a (f) several

Explanation:
ক: (a,b) 'The Internet' and 'the way' are definite; we refer to a specific global system and the general method. (c,d,e) 'In the early days' and 'the connection was the dial-up link' — 'the' for historically specific period and type of connection. (f) 'a dial-up link' — introducing one instance or type ('a' is fine).

খ: (a) 'Research shows' can be used without article when speaking generally; 'The research' is also acceptable if referencing a particular study. (b) 'regular exercise' — no article for general concept. (c) 'the risk' or 'a risk' — 'the risk of many diseases' is common idiomatically. (d,e) 'Even a small amount each day helps' — 'a' quantifies a singular small measurable amount.

গ: (a) 'She adopted a cat' — indefinite because new. (b) 'a cat from the shelter' — 'the shelter' if specific local shelter, otherwise 'a shelter' if unspecified. (d,e) 'The animal was very timid' — now definite because we've introduced it; 'The animal' refers back to that cat. (f) 'very timid' — adverb not requiring article.

ঘ: (a,b) 'In the experiment' or 'In an experiment' depending on specificity. If the sentence refers to a particular study just mentioned, use 'the experiment'; if introducing, use 'an experiment'. (c) 'a sample' — one sample of many possible. (d) 'the cells' — specific cells used. (e) 'a change' — one observed alteration. (f) 'several hours' — plural quantifier, no article.

Notes: Articles and determiners depend on whether the noun is being introduced for the first time (use 'a/an') or referred to again or uniquely (use 'the'). Quantifiers like 'some', 'several', 'many', and demonstratives like 'this/that' can substitute depending on emphasis; I've given the most natural, commonly used choices and clarified alternatives.

ঘ. Policies to ensure food security should focus on (a) ______ infrastructure, (b) ______ market access, and (c) ______ targeted social safety nets.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Rising population means per capita food demand increases, while arable land per person decreases. This narrows the margin for food security.

খ Climate variability causes lower yields; extreme events like droughts and floods cause crop losses and reduce income for farmers.

গ To improve resilience, farmers can adopt sustainable practices such as crop rotation, drip irrigation, and drought‑tolerant seed varieties.

ঘ Policies to ensure food security should focus on rural infrastructure, improved market access, and effective targeted social safety nets.

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'increases' captures rising demand as population and consumption grow. (b) 'decreases' reflects the declining share of arable land per person as population grows or land is lost.

খ: (a) 'lower' indicates reduced average yields caused by variable weather. (b) 'cause' links extreme events to direct physical losses of crops. (c) 'reduce' shows the economic consequence for farm incomes.

গ: (a) 'sustainable' practices improve long-term productivity and soil health. (b) 'drip' irrigation is a water‑efficient method often recommended to boost resilience. (c) 'drought‑tolerant' seed varieties are practical adaptations to more frequent dry spells.

ঘ: (a) 'rural infrastructure' (roads, storage, irrigation) reduces post‑harvest loss and connects farmers to markets. (b) 'improved market access' allows producers to sell surplus and obtain inputs. (c) 'effective targeted social safety nets' protect the most vulnerable during shocks and help stabilize demand. Each choice aligns with standard policy recommendations for strengthening food security and resilience.

ক (a) a; (b) a
খ (c) a; (d) the
গ (e) a; (f) x
ঘ (g) x; (h) a; (i) the

Explanation:
Detailed reasoning for each blank:

(a) a — 'a mark' is indefinite; punctuality is one mark among many, so use 'a'.

(b) a — General statement about any student: 'A student who reaches on time...' so 'a' is correct (capitalization at sentence start is grammatical but the article remains 'a').

(c) a — 'a good impression' is an indefinite singular impression; use 'a'.

(d) the — 'the importance of time' refers to a specific conceptual importance already known in context; use definite article 'the'.

(e) a — idiomatically we say 'go a long way' (meaning achieve much), so use 'a'.

(f) x — 'in life' does not take an article; the phrase is general, so no article (x).

(g) x — 'For many students' is the correct general phrase; no article before 'students' when 'many' quantifies it.

(h) a — 'a trivial matter' is indefinite; many consider it one trivial matter among others.

(i) the — 'the opposite' refers to a specific opposite concept already introduced, so use 'the'.

Explanation:
Explanations for the choices:

(a) an — 'essential' begins with a vowel sound, so the correct indefinite article is 'an' ('an essential element').

(b) the — 'the success of any organization' refers to the specific success being discussed (success as a defined outcome), so 'the' is appropriate.

(c) a — general statement about any single member: 'A member who contributes...' uses the indefinite article 'a'.

(d) the — 'the group' refers to the specific group within the organization; it's a definite entity in the sentence.

(e) the — 'the organization as a whole' points to the specific organization just mentioned, so the definite article 'the' is used.

Explanation:
Why each article fits:

(a) a — 'a quality' is indefinite; honesty is one quality among many admired everywhere.

(b) a — general statement: 'A person who speaks truthfully...' uses the indefinite article for any such individual.

(c) the — 'the trust of friends' refers to a specific kind of trust (the trust belonging to one's friends), so the definite article is used.

(d) x — 'mutual trust' in this general sense does not require an article: 'without mutual trust' is the standard phrasing.

(e) the — 'the importance of honesty' refers to a particular importance (the significance already under discussion), so 'the' is correct.

Question:
———– 21st February has become (a) ———– day of remembrance for Bangladesh. On this day we honour (b) ———– martyrs of the language movement who sacrificed (c) ———– lives for the right to speak our mother tongue. The event strengthened (d) ———– cultural identity and inspired (e) ———– generations to come. Every year people gather (f) ———– Shaheed Minar and observe the day with (g) ———– solemn silence. We remember (h) ———– brave souls and pay (i) ———– tribute to their sacrifice, keeping (j) ———– memory alive.

Options:
ক. Fill blanks (a)–(c).
খ. Fill blanks (d)–(f).
গ. Fill blanks (g)–(h).
ঘ. Fill blanks (i)–(j).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) On — 'On 21st February' is the standard prepositional phrase to indicate the day an event occurs.  (b) the — we refer to a specific group of martyrs, so the definite article 'the' is used.  (c) their — 'sacrificed their lives' is the natural possessive pronoun here.

খ (d) the — 'the cultural identity' points to a specific identity formed by the movement.  (e) future — 'inspired future generations' fits standard usage; alternatively 'generations to come' pairs with 'future'.  (f) at — 'gather at Shaheed Minar' is the correct preposition for meeting at a location.

গ (g) with — 'observe the day with solemn silence' uses 'with' to indicate manner.  (h) the — 'the brave souls' refers to the specific martyrs remembered on the day.

ঘ (i) our — 'pay our tribute' shows collective national respect.  (j) their — 'keeping their memory alive' correctly uses the possessive pronoun referring back to the martyrs.

Explanation:
Detailed reasoning: (a) 'On' is used to indicate a specific date. (b) and (d) use the definite article 'the' because we refer to a particular, known group (the martyrs / the cultural identity). (c) and (j) use 'their' to link the action to the martyrs. (e) 'future' pairs naturally with 'generations to come' and conveys continuing influence. (f) 'at' is the correct preposition for meeting at a physical monument (Shaheed Minar). (g) 'with' indicates the manner in which people observe the day, and (i) 'our' expresses collective national respect. The choices prioritize natural collocations and correct grammar for date phrases, articles, possessives, and prepositions.

The people endured (c) ———– prolonged struggle and paid (d) ———– heavy price in human lives. That proclamation rallied (e) ———– people across the country and set (f) ———– course towards freedom. Ceremonies are held (g) ———– towns and villages, and families honour (h) ———– lost relatives. We show (i) ———– gratitude to the heroes and renew (j) ———– pledge to build a prosperous nation.

Options:
ক. Fill blanks (a)–(c).
খ. Fill blanks (d)–(f).
গ. Fill blanks (g)–(h).
ঘ. Fill blanks (i)–(j).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) On — standard preposition for dates. (b) the — 'the destiny' because it refers to a specific, shared destiny of the people. (c) a — 'a prolonged struggle' is the common idiom to describe a lengthy conflict.

খ (d) a — 'paid a heavy price' is the fixed expression used to indicate severe losses. (e) the — 'the people' refers to the population of the country (definite). (f) a — 'set a course' is the idiom meaning to begin a path or direction.

গ (g) across — 'across towns and villages' correctly expresses nationwide occurrence. (h) their — 'honour their lost relatives' uses the possessive to refer back to the families' own members.

ঘ (i) our — 'show our gratitude' indicates collective national feeling. (j) our — 'renew our pledge' again uses the collective possessive to indicate a shared promise.

Explanation:
Notes on choices: (a) 'On' is used for specific calendar dates. (b) and (e) use 'the' because they denote particular, known entities (the destiny, the people). (c) and (d) use the indefinite article 'a' as part of common collocations ('a prolonged struggle', 'a heavy price'). (f) 'set a course' is an idiomatic phrase meaning to begin a direction or effort. (g) 'across' emphasizes distribution throughout the country; (h) uses 'their' to refer to the families’ own lost relatives. (i) and (j) are 'our' to show collective responsibility and emotion.

Options:
ক. Fill blanks (a)–(c).
খ. Fill blanks (d)–(f).
গ. Fill blanks (g)–(h).
ঘ. Fill blanks (i)–(j).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) a — 'a day of victory' is the natural noun phrase. (b) its — 'the nation regained its sovereignty' uses the possessive pronoun referring to Bangladesh. (c) the — 'the fighters' refers to the specific freedom fighters of 1971.

খ (d) their — 'honour their sacrifices' uses the possessive relating sacrifices to the fighters. (e) in — 'placed Bangladesh in an independent position' uses 'in' for location/metaphorically among nations. (f) the — 'the sense of national pride' refers to a specific feeling shared by the nation.

গ (g) with — 'decorated with flags' is the correct preposition. (h) cultural — 'organize cultural programs' matches common practice on national days; 'programs' is plural and 'cultural' describes them.

ঘ (i) a — 'observe a moment of silence' is the fixed expression. (j) the — 'recall the fallen heroes' uses the definite article because specific heroes are meant.

Explanation:
Rationale: (a) uses the indefinite article 'a' because 'day of victory' is a descriptive noun phrase. (b) 'its' denotes possession (sovereignty belonging to the nation). (c) and (d) use 'the' and 'their' to refer to specific fighters and their sacrifices. (e) 'in' is used to indicate placement 'in an independent position among nations' (other acceptable phrasing is 'among', but 'in' with 'position' is natural). (f) 'the sense' points to the particular, collective emotion. (g) 'with' is the correct preposition for ornamentation; (h) 'cultural programs' reflects common events held on such days. (i) 'a moment of silence' is a fixed collocation; (j) 'the fallen heroes' uses 'the' to indicate known, particular individuals being commemorated.

Question:
Rabindranath Tagore was (a) — towering Bengali polymath who was born in (b) — Jorasanko mansion on (c) — banks of (d) — Hooghly river. He became (e) — first non-European to win (f) — Nobel Prize in Literature. From (g) — young age he was exposed to (h) — rich cultural life of his family. He wrote (i) — Gitanjali and many other works that shaped (j) — modern Bengali literature.

Options:
ক. পূর্ণ করুন: (a), (b), (c)
খ. পূর্ণ করুন: (d), (e)
গ. পূর্ণ করুন: (f), (g)
ঘ. পূর্ণ করুন: (h), (i), (j)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) a — (b) the — (c) the.  
বিস্তারিত: 'a towering Bengali polymath'—একজন অজ্ঞাতসাধারণ ব্যক্তি হিসাবে 'a' ব্যবহৃত। 'the Jorasanko mansion'—নামসহ নির্দিষ্ট ভবন হলে 'the' প্রয়োজন। 'the banks'—নদীর তীরে অবস্থিত অংশটি নির্দিষ্ট হওয়ায় 'the'।

খ (d) the — (e) the.  
বিস্তারিত: 'the Hooghly river'—নদীর নামের আগে সাধারণত 'the' লাগে। 'the first non-European'—ধর্ম, জাত বা শ্রেণি নির্দিষ্ট করে প্রথম হওয়ার ক্ষেত্রে 'the first' ব্যবহার করি।

গ (f) the — (g) a.  
বিস্তারিত: 'the Nobel Prize'—বিশেষ পুরস্কার, নির্দিষ্ট নাম হওয়ায় 'the'। 'a young age'—সাধারণভাবে 'from a young age' বলে, অ-নির্দিষ্ট বয়স শুরু নির্দেশ করতে 'a' লাগে।

ঘ (h) the — (i) x — (j) x.  
বিস্তারিত: 'the rich cultural life'—পরিবারের নির্দিষ্ট সাংস্কৃতিক জীবনকে বোঝাচ্ছে, তাই 'the'। 'Gitanjali'—গ্রন্থের নাম সাধারণত নির্দিষ্ট আর্টিকেল ছাড়াই ব্যবহৃত (no article)। 'modern Bengali literature'—সাধারণ ধারণা, নির্দিষ্ট আর্টিকেল ছাড়া ব্যবহার করা হয় (no article)।

Explanation:
সংক্ষেপে আর্টিকেল নির্বাচন করার নিয়মগুলি: 'a/an' ব্যবহার করা হয় একক, অ-নির্দিষ্ট কাউকে/কিছু বোঝাতে; 'the' ব্যবহার করা হয় নির্দিষ্ট ব্যক্তি/স্থান/বস্তুকে বোঝাতে বা যখন প্রসঙ্গ থেকে নির্দিষ্টত্ব বোঝা যায়; কখনও কখনও নাম (ব্যক্তি, গ্রন্থ) বা বিমূর্ত সাধারণ ধারণার আগে আর্টিকেল থাকে না (x)। এখানে—'a towering...' যখন Tagore-কে একটি অ-নির্দিষ্ট শ্রেণিতে পরিচয় করানো হচ্ছে; ভবন এবং নদীর নামের ক্ষেত্রে নির্দিষ্ট হওয়ায় 'the' প্রয়োগ; 'first' এবং 'Nobel Prize' যেমন নির্দিষ্ট হওয়ায় 'the' লাগে; 'from a young age' কৌতুকভাবে সাধারণ অভিজ্ঞতা শুরু নির্দেশ করে, তাই 'a'। 'Gitanjali' এবং 'modern Bengali literature' সাধারণ নাম/ধারণা হিসেবে আর্টিকেল ছাড়া ভালো পড়ে।

Question:
Kazi Nazrul Islam was (a) — revolutionary poet and musician who was born in (b) — Churulia in (c) — Burdwan district. His poetry often spoke against (d) — injustice and for (e) — human dignity. At one point he served as (f) — soldier in (g) — British Indian Army before becoming (h) — prominent voice of Bengali resistance.

Options:
ক. পূর্ণ করুন: (a), (b)
খ. পূর্ণ করুন: (c), (d)
গ. পূর্ণ করুন: (e), (f)
ঘ. পূর্ণ করুন: (g), (h)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) a — (b) x.  
বিস্তারিত: 'a revolutionary poet'—কোনো নির্দিষ্ট ব্যক্তি নয়, তাই 'a'। 'in Churulia'—নামবিশিষ্ট গ্রামের ক্ষেত্রে সাধারণত আর্টিকেল ছাড়া 'in Churulia' লেখা হয় (no article)।

খ (c) the — (d) x.  
বিস্তারিত: 'the Burdwan district'—জেলা বা প্রশাসনিক একককে পরিভাষাগতভাবে নির্দিষ্ট করা হলে 'the' অনুচিত নয় (এখানে 'the Burdwan district' প্রাকটিক্যাল)। 'against injustice'—অবিচারের সাধারণ ধারণা, আর্টিকেল ছাড়া ব্যবহার হয়।

গ (e) x — (f) a.  
বিস্তারিত: 'for human dignity'—মানব মর্যাদাকে সাধারণ ধারণা হিসেবেই বলা হয়েছে, তাই আর্টিকেল লাগে না। 'as a soldier'—পেশা/পদবীর ক্ষেত্রে অ-নির্দিষ্ট একক বোঝাতে 'a' ব্যবহৃত হয়।

ঘ (g) the — (h) a.  
বিস্তারিত: 'the British Indian Army'—একটি নির্দিষ্ট সামরিক সংস্থা, তাই 'the'। 'a prominent voice'—কোনো নির্দিষ্ট ব্যক্তিকে নয়, একটি গোষ্ঠীর মধ্যে একজন হিসেবে 'a' ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।

Explanation:
আলাদা নির্দেশনা: রাষ্ট্রীয়/সংগঠনিক নামের আগে প্রায়শই 'the' লাগে (the United Nations, the British Indian Army)। ভুমিকাসূচক পেশা বা পরিচয়ে 'a/an' ব্যবহার করা হয় (a soldier, an artist)। সাধারণ ধারণা বা বিমূর্ত নাম (injustice, human dignity)–এ আর্টিকেল সাধারণত থাকে না। ভৌগলিক গ্রাম/শহরের নামের আগে আর্টিকেল না থাকা স্বাভাবিক (in Churulia), কিন্তু প্রশাসনিক ইউনিট (the Burdwan district)–এ 'the' ব্যবহার করা যায় কারণ এটি নির্দিষ্ট এলাকাকে নির্দেশ করে।

খ. পূর্ণ করুন: (c), (d)
গ. পূর্ণ করুন: (e), (f), (g)
ঘ. পূর্ণ করুন: (h), (i)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) a — (b) the.  
বিস্তারিত: 'a magnificent pink palace'—একটি অ-নির্দিষ্ট বাদামি/এক ধরনের প্রাসাদ হিসেবে 'a'। 'on the banks'—নদীর তীরকে বোঝাতে সাধারণত 'the banks' বলা হয়।

খ (c) the — (d) x.  
বিস্তারিত: 'the Buriganga river'—নদীর নামের আগে স্বাভাবিকভাবে 'the'। 'in Dhaka'—শহরের নামের আগে আর্টিকেল লাগে না (no article)।

গ (e) the — (f) the — (g) a.  
বিস্তারিত: 'the residence'—এই ভবনটি নির্দিষ্টভাবে বাসস্থান হিসেবেই উল্লেখ হলে 'the' ব্যবহার করা হয়। 'the Nawabs of Dhaka'—নোয়াবগণের একটি নির্দিষ্ট গোষ্ঠী/উপাধি, তাই 'the' প্রযোজ্য। 'is now a museum'—একটি ধরণের স্থানে রূপান্তরিত হওয়ায় 'a museum' বলা হয়, কারণ এটি ছিল/হয় একটি ধরণের প্রতিষ্ঠান।

ঘ (h) x — (i) x.  
বিস্তারিত: 'tourists'—সাধারণভাবে বহিঃপ্রবাহের দর্শনার্থীদের বোঝাতে আর্টিকেল ছাড়া 'tourists' ব্যবহার করা যায়। 'many countries'—পরিমাণসূচক বহুবচনবিশিষ্ট শব্দের আগে আর্টিকেল লাগে না ('from many countries')।

Explanation:
নিয়মের সারমর্ম: আবাস/প্রতিষ্ঠান/প্রাসাদের পরিচয়ে 'a' বা 'the' নির্ভর করে নির্দিষ্টতা ও পরিচিতির উপর। নদী বা তীরের ক্ষেত্রে 'the' বহুল প্রচলিত ('the Ganges', 'the Buriganga', 'on the banks')। শহর/গ্রামের নামের আগে সাধারণত আর্টিকেল থাকে না ('in Dhaka', 'in London')। গোষ্ঠী/পদ বা ঐতিহ্যবাহী শিরোনামের ক্ষেত্রে (the Nawabs) 'the' ব্যবহার করা হয়। 'tourists from many countries'—উভয়ই সাধারণ প্রকাশ, আর্টিকেল ছাড়াই সঠিক।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) the, (b) the
খ (c) the, (d) The
গ (e) × (no article), (f) an
ঘ (g) the, (h) × (no article)

Explanation:
(a) the — 'the past decade' is a definite period known to speaker and listener; use the definite article.
(b) the — 'the metropolitan region' refers to a specific, previously identified urban area.
(c) the — named government or national agencies normally take 'the' because they are unique institutions (the National Air Monitoring Agency).
(d) The — sentence-initial reference to a particular phenomenon (smog that affects the city) takes the definite article; capitalization in the passage can be retained as 'The'.
(e) × (no article) — 'chronic respiratory illnesses' is a plural noun used generically; plural count nouns commonly appear without an article when speaking generally.
(f) an — 'an increase' requires the indefinite article 'an' because 'increase' begins with a vowel sound and refers to a singular, countable event.
(g) the — 'the problem' points back to the specific air-quality problem already described; definite article required.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) the, (b) the
খ (c) the, (d) a
গ (e) × (no article), (f) a
ঘ (g) the, (h) the

Explanation:
(a) the — 'the last century' refers to a specific, commonly-referenced time span; use the definite article.
(b) the — when referring to a particular species already identified by context, 'the endemic tortoise species' is definite.
(c) the — 'the brink of extinction' is a fixed phrase denoting a specific critical state; use 'the'.
(d) a — 'a remote island' indicates one among possibly several remote islands; indefinite article 'a' is correct because the island is not uniquely specified earlier.
(e) × (no article) — 'invasive rodents' is a plural noun used generally to describe the category of animals posing threat; no article needed for plural generic reference.
(f) a — 'a comprehensive eradication program' uses the indefinite article because it introduces one such program.
(g) the — 'the population of ground-nesting birds' refers back to the specific local population affected earlier; definite article is appropriate.
(h) the — 'the prospects' or 'the prospects for long-term ecological restoration' points to a particular evaluative outlook being discussed; 'the' makes it definite.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) the, (b) × (no article)
খ (c) the, (d) such
গ (e) already strained economies — × (no article) or optionally 'the' depending on context; best: ×
ঘ (g) × (no article), (h) a

Explanation:
(a) the — 'the mid-century' is a specific temporal reference (mid-21st century); use 'the'.
(b) × (no article) — 'millions of people' is an indefinite, large number used generically; we do not use 'the' here unless referring to a specific, previously identified group.
(c) the — the fixed phrase 'in the absence of' requires the definite article.
(d) such — 'such displacement' is idiomatic here: 'such' refers back to the displacement just described; 'the displacement' could also work, but 'such' emphasizes the kind/scale of displacement.
(e) × (no article) — 'already strained economies' is a plural, general reference to economies that are strained; no article is acceptable for general plural reference. If the writer means those specific economies already mentioned, 'the already strained economies' could be used; in this context the generic form without article is natural.
(f) Greater — this word begins the phrase and does not need an article: 'Greater international cooperation...'.
(g) × (no article) — 'sustainable coastal planning' is an uncountable/abstract activity used generically; no article required.
(h) a — 'a humanitarian crisis' is one instance of a crisis; the indefinite article 'a' is appropriate because it introduces the type of crisis that might occur.

Question:
Diogenes was famous for carrying (a) ____ lamp even in (b) ____ daytime, saying he was searching for (c) ____ honest man. One afternoon (d) ____ child began to tease him and called him (e) ____ eccentric. Diogenes put (f) ____ lamp under his arm and walked to (g) ____ market. The onlookers found (h) ____ whole scene surprisingly amusing.

Options:
ক. Fill in blanks (a) এবং (b)
খ. Fill in blanks (c) এবং (d)
গ. Fill in blanks (e) এবং (f)
ঘ. Fill in blanks (g) এবং (h)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) a lamp; (b) broad (→ "in broad daytime" commonly phrased as "in broad daylight", so here "broad" completes the idiom). 
খ (c) an honest man; (d) a child. 
গ (e) an eccentric; (f) his lamp. 
ঘ (g) the market; (h) the whole scene.

Explanation:
Answers and reasoning:
- (a) 'a lamp' — use the indefinite article 'a' because we introduce one lamp (consonant sound 'l').
- (b) 'broad' — the common fixed expression is 'in broad daylight'. The passage gives 'daytime', so 'broad' completes the idiom; alternatively the phrase could be written 'in the daytime' but 'in broad daylight' is idiomatic.
- (c) 'an honest man' — 'honest' begins with a vowel sound (silent 'h'), so use 'an'.
- (d) 'a child' — introducing a non-specific single child uses 'a'.
- (e) 'an eccentric' — 'eccentric' begins with a vowel sound, so 'an' is correct.
- (f) 'his lamp' — 'his' shows possession (he carried it), so 'his lamp' is most natural.
- (g) 'the market' — a specific market that people make reference to in the town; use 'the'.
- (h) 'the whole scene' — 'whole scene' is definite and specific, so 'the' is appropriate.
General notes: choose 'a/an' for non-specific singular nouns (based on vowel/consonant sounds), 'the' for specific or previously-mentioned nouns, and use possessives (his/her) when ownership is implied. Idiomatic phrases (e.g., 'in broad daylight') should be preserved.

Question:

ক. Fill in blanks (a) এবং (b)
খ. Fill in blanks (c) এবং (d)
গ. Fill in blanks (e) এবং (f)
ঘ. Fill in blanks (g) এবং (h)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) a nearby village; (b) an old musician. 
খ (c) a wooden flute; (d) the musician. 
গ (e) a question; (f) for some advice (→ "asked for some advice"). 
ঘ (g) a brief reply; (h) a contented look.

Explanation:
Why these choices work:
- (a) 'a nearby village' — the village is introduced as one among possibly many, so use the indefinite article 'a'.
- (b) 'an old musician' — 'old' begins with a vowel sound, so 'an' is used for a non-specific single person.
- (c) 'a wooden flute' — 'a' introduces a single, unspecified instrument; 'wooden' describes the flute.
- (d) 'the musician' — after mentioning 'an old musician', referring back to him uses the definite article 'the' because he is now specific in the context.
- (e) 'a question' — an unspecified single query brought to Confucius.
- (f) 'for some advice' — the verb 'ask' commonly takes 'for' when requesting help: 'asked for advice'; 'some' softens the noun and is natural here.
- (g) 'a brief reply' — indefinite article for a non-specific short answer.
- (h) 'a contented look' — 'a' introduces the look as one instance of an expression.
Grammar tips: use 'a/an' to introduce non-specific singular nouns, switch to 'the' when that noun becomes specific or previously mentioned, and include prepositions like 'for' when required by the verb (e.g., 'ask for advice').

One dusk (e) ____ apprentice grew impatient and demanded (f) ____ quick secret to fame. The poet brewed (g) ____ tea, smiled, and told him that (h) ____ truth often arrives slowly.

Options:

খ. Fill in blanks (c) এবং (d)
গ. Fill in blanks (e) এবং (f)
ঘ. Fill in blanks (g) এবং (h)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) the sea; (b) his young apprentice. 
খ (c) the small changes; (d) the vastness of the sky. 
গ (e) the apprentice; (f) a quick secret (or 'a quick trick'). 
ঘ (g) some tea; (h) the truth.

Explanation:
Detailed reasoning:
- (a) 'the sea' — when speaking of the sea in relation to where someone lives, 'the sea' is idiomatic (specific body of water relative to that home).
- (b) 'his young apprentice' — 'his' indicates the poet's pupil; use the possessive rather than an indefinite article to show the relationship.
- (c) 'the small changes' — these are the particular changes the poet pointed out, so make them definite.
- (d) 'the vastness of the sky' — 'the vastness' is a specific quality being referred to; 'of the sky' makes it definite.
- (e) 'the apprentice' — refers back to the previously-mentioned apprentice, so use 'the'.
- (f) 'a quick secret' (or 'a quick trick') — an indefinite single thing demanded; either word is acceptable depending on nuance ('secret' emphasizes knowledge, 'trick' emphasizes a shortcut).
- (g) 'some tea' — natural in English when offering an uncountable beverage in a non-specific amount.
- (h) 'the truth' — 'truth' here is definite, the particular truth the poet refers to; we can say 'the truth often arrives slowly'.
Article guidance: use 'the' for specific, known, or previously-mentioned items; use 'a/an' for introducing non-specific singular nouns; use possessives to show relationships; use 'some' for unspecified amounts of uncountable nouns.

গ. (c) স্থানে কোন শব্দ বসাবেন? 
ঘ. (d) স্থানে কোন শব্দ বসাবেন? 


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক an — কারণ "influx" শব্দটি স্বরধ্বনি দিয়ে শুরু হওয়ায় পূর্বে অ-বিবেচক আর্টিকেল হিসেবে "an" ব্যবহার করা উপযুক্ত।
খ the — এখানে "the rural areas" ব্যবহার করে ধরে নেয়া হয়েছে যে ঢাকায় আসা মানুষগুলো নির্দিষ্ট গ্রামীণ এলাকার থেকে আসছে; তাই নির্দিষ্টতা দেখাতে "the" উপযুক্ত।
গ the — "infrastructure" সাধারণত অসংখ্য উপাদানের সমষ্টি এবং নির্দিষ্ট পরিস্থিতিতে নির্দিষ্ট অবকাঠামোকে নির্দেশ করলে "the infrastructure" ব্যবহার করা হয়।
ঘ a — "housing crisis" একটি গণ্য করা সমস্যার নাম, তাই অনির্দিষ্ট সংকট বোঝাতে "a" ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে।

Explanation:
বিস্তারিত ব্যাখ্যা:
ক: "influx" শব্দটি [iŋ-flʌks] — স্বরধ্বনি (i-) দিয়ে শুরু হয়; English grammar অনুযায়ী স্বরধ্বনী শব্দের আগে "an" আর্টিকেল ব্যবহার করা হয় (উদাহরণ: an apple, an hour)। এখানে "an influx" বলতে একটি উল্লেখযোগ্য প্রবাহ বোঝানো হয়েছে, তাই "an" সঠিক।
খ: "from the rural areas" বা "from rural areas" — উভয়ই ব্যবহারযোগ্য, তবে বাক্যটিতে ঢাকায় আসা মানুষের উৎস হিসেবে নির্দিষ্ট গ্রামীণ অঞ্চলগুলোকে ইঙ্গিত করা হলে "the rural areas" সঠিকভাবে নির্দিষ্টতা দেয়। তাই "the" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।
গ: "infrastructure" শব্দটি সাধারণত অবকাঠামোর সমষ্টি বোঝায়; যখন কোন শহরের সামগ্রিক অবকাঠামোকে চিহ্নিত করা হয় (পানিসহ ব্যবস্থা, সড়ক, নিকাশী ইত্যাদি) তখন "the infrastructure" বলা যায়। এখানে ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে নির্দিষ্ট অবকাঠামোর উপর চাপের কথা বোঝাতে, সুতরাং "the" প্রয়োজন।
ঘ: "a housing crisis" — এখানে একটি অনির্দিষ্ট তবে বাস্তব সংকটকে নির্দেশ করা হয়েছে; ইংরেজিতে এমন ক্ষেত্রে অনির্দিষ্ট আর্টিকেল "a" ব্যবহৃত হয়।
সংক্ষেপে: বাক্যের স্বরূপ এবং নির্দিষ্টতা বিবেচনা করে উপরের আর্টিকেল/বিশেষণগুলো উপযুক্ত।

Question:
Although Bangladesh has (a) _____ literacy rate compared to past decades, the quality of education in many districts remains (b) _____. Teachers often lack (c) _____ training and classrooms have (d) _____ basic facilities.

Options:
ক. (a) স্থানে কোন শব্দ বা শব্দগুচ্ছ বসাবেন?
খ. (b) স্থানে কোন বিশেষণ বসাবেন?
গ. (c) স্থানে কোন শব্দ বসালে উপযুক্ত হবে?
ঘ. (d) স্থানে কোন শব্দ বসাবেন?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a higher — "literacy rate" তুলনা করা হচ্ছে অতীত দশকের সঙ্গে, তাই তুলনামূলক বিশেষণ ব্যবহার করা প্রয়োজন: "a higher literacy rate"।
খ inadequate — শিক্ষা মানের অবনতি বোঝাতে "inadequate" (অপর্যাপ্ত/অপ্রতুল) উপযুক্ত।
গ proper — শিক্ষকরা প্রয়োজনীয় দক্ষতা ও প্রশিক্ষণ থেকে বঞ্চিত, তাই "proper training" অর্থে "proper" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।
ঘ very few — ক্লাসরুমগুলোতে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ সুবিধাগুলি অপ্রতুল; "very few basic facilities" বলে এ অবস্থা শ্রুতিবদ্ধভাবে বোঝানো হয়েছে।

Explanation:
বিস্তারিত ব্যাখ্যা:
ক: বাক্যটি তুলনামূলক (compared to past decades), তাই আমরা এমন একটি বিশেষণ চাই যা তুলনা প্রকাশ করে: "higher", "improved" ইত্যাদি। সাধারণ ইংরেজিতে সম্পূর্ণ করে বললে "a higher literacy rate" সঠিক। এখানে "a" লাগে কারণ "literacy rate" একটি গণ্যনীয় পরিমাপ।
খ: "the quality of education... remains _____" — এখানে মানকে নেগেটিভভাবে তুলনা করা হচ্ছে; "inadequate" মানে পর্যাপ্ত না, যা অর্থপূর্ণভাবে প্রয়োগযোগ্য। অন্য বিকল্প যেমন "variable" বা "uneven" হলেও প্রশ্নের প্রসঙ্গে "inadequate" বেশি স্পষ্ট।
গ: "Teachers often lack (c) _____ training" — সাধারণভাবে বলা হয় "lack proper training"; "proper" এখানে যোগ্যতা ও প্রয়োজনীয়তা বোঝায়। "adequate training" ও চলতে পারে কিন্তু বাক্যটিতে সাধারণ রূপে "proper" বেশি প্রাকটিক্যাল।
ঘ: "classrooms have (d) _____ basic facilities" — এটি একটি পরিমাণগত অভাব নির্দেশ করে; "very few basic facilities" অর্থাৎ খুব কম মৌলিক সুবিধা আছে, যা মূলনীতিগত সমস্যা নির্দেশ করে।
ভাষাগতভাবে এসব শব্দ বিকল্প হিসেবে বদলানো যেতে পারে, তবে উপরের পছন্দগুলো বাক্যের অর্থ ও স্বর বজায় রেখে ঠিকঠাক ফিট করে।

Options:
ক. (a) স্থানে কোন বিশেষণ বসাবেন?

গ. (c) স্থানে কোন শব্দ ব্যবহার করবেন?
ঘ. (d) স্থানে কোন বিশেষণ বা শব্দ বসাবেন?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a growing — "a growing threat" বলতে ক্রমান্বয়ে বাড়তে থাকা বিপদের কথা বোঝে; তাই "a growing" উপযুক্ত।
খ the — "the rising sea levels" বলতে নির্দিষ্ট এক ঝুকি/ঘটনা বোঝানো হচ্ছে (বিশ্বস্ত তথ্য অনুযায়ী সাগরের উচ্চতা বাড়ছে), তাই "the" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।
গ excessive — সমুদ্রের লবণ পদার্থের মাত্রা বেড়ে যাওয়াকে বোঝাতে "excessive salinity" ঠিক বলে; অর্থাৎ অত্যধিক স্যালিনিটি।
ঘ potable — "potable drinking water" বলতে পানের উপযোগী পানি বুঝায়; এখানে স্যালিনিটি সেই পানিকে অযোগ্য করে তুলছে বলে "potable" সঠিক শব্দ।

Explanation:
বিস্তারিত ব্যাখ্যা:
ক: "threat" শব্দের আগে একটি নির্ণায়ক বিশেষণ লাগবে যা তার মাত্রা বা প্রকৃতি বলে; "a growing threat" বলে ধীরে ধীরে বাড়তে থাকা সমস্যাকে বোঝায় — উপকূলীয় গ্রামগুলোর জন্য উপযুক্ত বর্ণনা।
খ: "rising sea levels" সাধারণ একটি বিশ্বব্যাপী ঘটনা, কিন্তু বাক্যে তা নির্দিষ্টভাবে ওই এলাকার জন্য প্রাসঙ্গিক হওয়ায় "the rising sea levels" বলা যায় — এইভাবে নির্দিষ্ট ঘটনা/পরিবর্তনকে নির্দেশ করা হয়।
গ: "salinity pollutes their drinking water" — এখানে স্যালিনিটি’র মাত্রা বাড়ার কারণেই পানীয় জল দূষিত হচ্ছে; তাই "excessive" বা "increased" ব্যবহার করা যায়; "excessive" বেশি স্পষ্টভাবে অতি মাত্রাটিকে বলেন।
ঘ: "drinking water"-এর গুণগত দিক বোঝাতে ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে "potable" (পানীয় যোগ্য)। বাক্যটি বলছে স্যালিনিটির কারণে তাদের potable water কমে বা দূষিত হচ্ছে; তাই "potable" শব্দটি উপযুক্ত।
সামগ্রিকভাবে এই শব্দচয়ন পরিবেশগত কারণে সৃষ্ট বাস্তব সমস্যার থিমের সঙ্গে সামঞ্জস্যপূর্ণ।

Explanation:
ক (fundamentally): 'Fundamentally' conveys 'at its core' and fits the opening clause about technology's nature. খ (societal): 'Societal impact' refers to effects on society as a whole; 'societal' is the right adjective. গ (human): The phrase 'depends on human decisions' is concise and accurate — 'human' identifies whose choices matter. ঘ (responsible): 'Responsible use' is the standard collocation indicating use that benefits society; 'responsible' completes the thought.

Question:
An arrogant person rarely finds favour (a) —— others. He behaves as (b) —— he knows everything. A sensible (c) —— man will correct (d) —— behaviour gently.

Options:
ক. (a) পূরণ করুন
খ. (b) পূরণ করুন
গ. (c) পূরণ করুন
ঘ. (d) পূরণ করুন


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক with
খ as if
গ wise
ঘ his

Explanation:
ক (with): The idiom is "find favour with someone" — we use the preposition 'with' after 'find favour'.

খ (as if): "Behaves as if he knows everything" expresses an unreal or hypothetical manner; 'as if' is the correct conjunction.

গ (wise): 'A sensible wise man' — 'wise' is the adjective that fits the meaning 'sensible' here; it describes the kind of man who corrects gently.

ঘ (his): We use the possessive determiner 'his' to indicate the man's own behaviour: "correct his behaviour".

Correct Answer:

খ the
গ a
ঘ with

Explanation:
ক (his): 'lend his tools' — 'his' specifies whose tools are lent.

খ (the): 'the needy' is a common noun phrase referring to needy people as a class; we use the definite article 'the'.

গ (a): 'If you meet a stranger' — indefinite article 'a' introduces any one stranger you might meet.

ঘ (with): The correct collocation is 'treat someone with respect' — use the preposition 'with' before 'respect'.

Options:

খ. (b) পূরণ করুন

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক more
খ for
গ in
ঘ privately

Explanation:
ক (more): The phrase 'learn more quickly' is idiomatic — 'more' modifies the adverb 'quickly'.

খ (for): 'Praised for their success' — 'for' indicates the reason/occasion for praise.

গ (in): 'scolded in public' is the standard expression meaning being reprimanded where others can see.

ঘ (privately): Contrasts with 'in public' — praise given 'privately' means in private; 'privately' is the correct adverb.

Options:
ক. Fill in blank (a) with the correct article/determiner.

গ. Fill in blank (c) with the correct article/determiner.
ঘ. Fill in blank (d) with the correct article/determiner.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a
খ a
গ the
ঘ the

Explanation:
ক (a = a): We use 'a' with 'evening' in the phrase 'Late one a evening' (more naturally: 'Late one evening' or 'a late evening'); here 'a' signals one unspecified instance of evening. খ (b = a): 'a loaf' is indefinite — the baker notices one loaf missing (not a previously specified loaf), so 'a' is appropriate. গ (c = the): 'the counter' is definite because it refers to the specific counter in the baker's shop. ঘ (d = the): 'the bright wooden table' is definite as it points to a particular table in the scene. Overall, use 'a' for introducing something non-specific and 'the' when the noun is specific or known in context.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a
খ a
গ the
ঘ a

Explanation:
ক (a = a): 'a foggy morning' introduces a non-specific morning; 'a' is the correct indefinite article. খ (b = a): 'a small dinghy' — the dinghy is not previously specified, so use 'a'. গ (c = the): 'the distant ship' refers to a particular ship visible in the scene, so the definite article 'the' is appropriate. ঘ (d = a): 'a white handkerchief' is introduced here as one item used to wave; it's indefinite because it hasn't been mentioned before. The general rule used: 'a/an' for non-specific or first-mentioned nouns, 'the' for specific or previously identifiable nouns.

খ. Fill in blank (b) with the correct article/determiner.

ঘ. Fill in blank (d) with the correct article/determiner.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a
খ a
গ the
ঘ a

Explanation:
ক (a = a): 'a bright spring morning' uses 'a' to introduce one unspecific morning among many. খ (b = a): 'a packet' is being mentioned for the first time, so it is indefinite. গ (c = the): 'the seeds' refers specifically to the seeds that came from that packet — they are now identified, so 'the' is used. ঘ (d = a): 'a clay pot' introduces one pot among possible pots; it's not previously specified, so 'a' is correct. In each case, choose 'a/an' for first-mention or non-specific nouns and 'the' when the noun is specific or already identified in context.

Correct Answer:

Explanation:
ক: 'an' — 'unimpeachable' begins with a vowel sound (/ʌ/), so the correct indefinite article is 'an'.

খ: 'the' — superlative expressions like 'the most convenient' take the definite article 'the'.

গ: 'a' — the phrase 'a day' is indefinite; we say 'cannot imagine a day' meaning 'even a single day'.

ঘ: 'our' — possession is intended here (the reader’s own timeline), so 'our timeline' is natural and grammatical.

Explanation:
ক: 'the' — when referring to a habitual action (the usual newspaper one reads), 'the newspaper' is natural.

খ: 'a' — 'a cup of tea' is an indefinite single item; use 'a'.

গ: 'the' — 'the headlines' refers to the specific prominent items in that paper; definite article fits.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক an
খ the
গ an
ঘ a

Explanation:
ক: 'an' — 'important' is an adjective starting with a vowel sound, but because 'important' is preceded by the indefinite article before a singular count noun ('source'), we use 'an important source'.

খ: 'the' — 'the age of rapid information' is a specific period conceptually recognized (definite), so 'the' is appropriate.

গ: 'an' — 'hour' begins with a vowel sound (/aʊər/), so 'an hour' is correct.

ঘ: 'a' — 'a person with a narrow outlook' uses the indefinite article because we describe one (unspecified) such person; 'a' is correct.

Question:
Monsoon arrived early this year and with it a sharp rise in mosquito‑borne illnesses. The local clinic reports many fever cases and parents worry about their youngsters. The municipal notice reads: (a) — _____ rise in dengue cases has been observed. For (b) — _____ children and the elderly these infections are particularly risky. Small puddles, buckets and clogged drains are (c) — _____ for mosquito breeding. Therefore the notice urges (d) — _____ community participation to eliminate these sites.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a): choose the correct article/phrase to complete the sentence.
খ. Fill blank (b): supply the correct words to refer to vulnerable groups.
গ. Fill blank (c): supply the appropriate adjective describing water that allows mosquito reproduction.
ঘ. Fill blank (d): give the best noun phrase to indicate the required collective response.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "a"
খ উত্তর: "children and the elderly"
গ উত্তর: "standing" (or "stagnant")
ঘ উত্তর: "collective community action" (or "community participation")

Explanation:
ক: The sentence "(a) — _____ rise in dengue cases has been observed" needs an indefinite article because we are reporting one instance of an observed rise: "a rise in dengue cases." Using "the" would imply a specific previously known rise; "a" is the natural choice.

খ: Vulnerable groups should be referred to as "children and the elderly." English commonly uses the definite article with "elderly" ("the elderly"); combining both gives the clear phrase "children and the elderly." This correctly identifies the groups at higher risk.

গ: Mosquitoes breed in "standing" or "stagnant" water — water that does not flow and remains in containers, puddles or drains. Both adjectives are acceptable; "standing" is very common in public‑health messaging.

ঘ: The notice calls for community‑level effort. Phrases like "collective community action" or simply "community participation" convey that residents must work together (cleaning, removing breeding sites, reporting stagnant water) to reduce mosquito populations.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "eliminate" or "remove"
খ উত্তর: "blocked or clogged drains"
গ উত্তর: "protective" (as in "protective measures")
ঘ উত্তর: "clean‑up drives" or "vector control drives"

Explanation:
ক: "Eliminate" or "remove" potential breeding sites is the correct public‑health instruction: dispose of containers, clean gutters, and eliminate standing water.

খ: Drains that do not flow properly are often described as "blocked" or "clogged drains." Reporting these to municipal services helps prevent stagnant pools.

গ: "Protective measures" is the natural phrase for actions individuals take to avoid bites (bed nets, repellents, coils, appropriate clothing).

ঘ: Community efforts are commonly called "clean‑up drives" or "vector control drives." Regular monthly drives help remove debris and standing water, reducing mosquito breeding over time.

খ উত্তর: "insect repellent" (e.g., DEET or picaridin)
গ উত্তর: "containers" or "water‑holding containers" (e.g., saucers, tyres)
ঘ উত্তর: "daytime" (especially early morning and late afternoon)

Explanation:
ক: An insecticide‑treated bed net (ITN) provides both a physical barrier and chemical protection while sleeping outdoors; it is recommended for malaria prevention.

খ: Topical insect repellents (DEET, picaridin, IR3535) applied to exposed skin before going outdoors reduce bites. The poster should advise an EPA‑approved repellent.

গ: Mosquitoes like Aedes species lay eggs in small "containers" or "water‑holding containers" — any object that can hold a little water (flower‑pot saucers, discarded tyres, cans). Removing or emptying these prevents breeding.

ঘ: Aedes mosquitoes (which transmit dengue, chikungunya and Zika) are primarily daytime biters, with peak activity in early morning and late afternoon. This contrasts with Anopheles mosquitoes (malaria) that bite mostly at night.

Type: CQ | Book: English 2nd Paper | Years:  | Boards:  | Tags:

Question:
On the global internet, English has become (ক)_____ language for content and communication. Most educational platforms publish materials (খ)_____ English, and social media users often post (গ)_____ a blend of their native language and English to reach wider audiences. To make profiles accessible internationally, write descriptions (ঘ)_____ plain, correct English.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (ক): choose the correct word or phrase.
খ. Fill blank (খ): choose the correct preposition.
গ. Fill blank (গ): choose the correct verb or preposition.
ঘ. Fill blank (ঘ): choose the correct preposition or adverb.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক the dominant
খ in
গ using
ঘ in

Explanation:
ক — 'the dominant' is correct because English is being described as the leading or prevailing language on the internet; the definite article 'the' is needed before an adjective phrase that identifies a unique status. 

খ — 'in' is the appropriate preposition to indicate the language in which materials are published ('published in English'). 

গ — 'using' fits the sentence structure: users 'post using a blend...' (gerund/participle expresses the manner). 'In' could also be used ('post in a blend...') but 'using' emphasizes the method. 

ঘ — 'in' is correct for languages/styles: 'write descriptions in plain, correct English.' An adverb like 'plainly' would not collocate as well in this structure.

Question:
Academic journals often ask authors to submit manuscripts (ক)_____ formal English. For non-native writers, having a colleague or editor review the draft can be (খ)_____ help. Abstracts should be (গ)_____ concise and (ঘ)_____ accurate to convey the study clearly.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (ক): choose the correct preposition.
খ. Fill blank (খ): choose the correct idiomatic phrase.
গ. Fill blank (গ): choose the correct linking word (if any).
ঘ. Fill blank (ঘ): choose the correct adverb.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক in
খ of great
গ both
ঘ highly

Explanation:
ক — 'in formal English' uses the preposition 'in' to indicate the language/style required for submission. 

খ — 'of great' completes the idiom 'can be of great help' (meaning very helpful). Alternatives like 'a great' would require a different sentence structure ('can be a great help'). 

গ — 'both' pairs the two required qualities: 'both concise and highly accurate.' It signals that two attributes are expected simultaneously. 

ঘ — 'highly' is an appropriate adverb modifying 'accurate' to stress the degree of precision needed in abstracts.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (ক): choose the correct intensifier.
খ. Fill blank (খ): choose the correct word to show dual usage.
গ. Fill blank (গ): choose the correct preposition.
ঘ. Fill blank (ঘ): choose the correct comparative/adverb.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক much
খ both
গ into
ঘ more

Explanation:
ক — 'much easier' is a common collocation where 'much' intensifies the comparative 'easier.' 'Far' could also work, but 'much' is natural here. 

খ — 'both' correctly introduces a dual-language situation: 'both in English and the local language.' 

গ — 'into' is the proper preposition when translating something from one language into another ('translate notes into a visitor's language'). 

ঘ — 'more' is the comparative used with 'inclusive' to indicate a greater degree of inclusivity ('more inclusive').

Question:
A patient teacher explains complex topics (a) —— clearly, and (b) —— time he spends helps (c) —— eager learner. There is a difference between (d) —— knowledge and mere curiosity.

Options:
ক. Fill (a)
খ. Fill (b)
গ. Fill (c)
ঘ. Fill (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক so
খ the
গ an
ঘ true

Explanation:
ক (so): 'explains complex topics so clearly' uses 'so' as an intensifier to show degree — it modifies the adjective 'clearly'.
খ (the): 'the time he spends' uses the definite article 'the' because we refer to a specific amount of time already implied (the time that he spends teaching).
গ (an): 'an eager learner' uses the indefinite article 'an' before a vowel sound; 'eager' begins with a vowel sound so 'an' is correct.
ঘ (true): 'true knowledge' contrasts with 'mere curiosity'; 'true' is the appropriate adjective to emphasize genuine understanding rather than superficial interest.

Question:

Options:
ক. Fill (a)
খ. Fill (b)
গ. Fill (c)
ঘ. Fill (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক the
খ a
গ us
ঘ of

Explanation:
ক (the): 'the rich man' is used generically to refer to a particular kind of person (the wealthy individual being discussed); 'the' makes it specific in that context.
খ (a): 'a poor person' uses the indefinite article 'a' because we are referring to any one poor person in general, not a specific individual.
গ (us): 'may teach us valuable lessons' — 'us' serves as the object pronoun indicating who receives the lessons; it fits naturally and completes the verb 'teach'.
ঘ (of): 'responsibility of society' is a standard noun phrase where 'of' links 'responsibility' to its possessor/agent, 'society'.

Options:
ক. Fill (a)
খ. Fill (b)
গ. Fill (c)
ঘ. Fill (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক all
খ whether
গ the
ঘ the

Explanation:
ক (all): 'destroy all calm' is an idiomatic phrase meaning to completely remove calmness; 'all' emphasizes totality.
খ (whether): 'whether educated or not' introduces a contrastive clause meaning 'regardless of education'; 'whether' is the correct conjunction here.
গ (the): 'restore the peace' commonly uses the definite article 'the' because it refers to a specific state of peace previously mentioned or understood.
ঘ (the): 'the power of one person' uses 'the' to single out 'power' as a distinct, definable force; the phrase 'the power of one' is idiomatic and emphasizes the influence of a single individual.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a): choose the correct article or phrase to complete the sentence.
খ. Fill blank (b): choose the correct article to precede the adjective.
গ. Fill blank (c): choose the correct preposition (if any).
ঘ. Fill blank (d): choose the correct determiner for the noun 'books'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a
খ an
গ (none) — omit a preposition; use "visit it every Saturday"
ঘ some

Explanation:
ক: 'a well-stocked' is correct because we use the indefinite article 'a' before a singular countable noun phrase 'well-stocked (library)'.

খ: 'an invaluable' is correct because 'invaluable' begins with a vowel sound, so the indefinite article 'an' is used.

গ: No preposition is needed before 'it' in 'visit it every Saturday.' Using 'on' is possible ('on Saturdays'), but with 'every Saturday' we omit 'on'.

ঘ: 'some books' is appropriate because children borrow an unspecified number of books; 'some' is the natural determiner for plural countable nouns in such contexts.

Question:
Social media has become (a) — popular, but it rarely replaces (b) — depth of a well-researched feature. Many readers scan (c) — headlines and miss (d) — nuanced analysis beneath them.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a): choose the best adverb to indicate growing popularity.
খ. Fill blank (b): choose the correct article before 'depth'.
গ. Fill blank (c): choose the appropriate determiner/adverb for 'headlines'.
ঘ. Fill blank (d): choose the correct article before 'nuanced analysis'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক increasingly
খ the
গ the
ঘ (no article) — omit 'the' or use 'the' depending on meaning; here omit

Explanation:
ক: 'increasingly popular' correctly conveys that popularity is growing over time; 'more popular' is also possible but 'increasingly' fits smoothly.

খ: 'the depth' is correct because we refer to a specific quality — the depth that a long, well-researched feature provides.

গ: 'the headlines' is natural when referring to the set of headlines people scan in general; if speaking about headlines in general, 'headlines' without article can sometimes work, but 'the headlines' emphasizes the typical headlines readers encounter.

ঘ: 'nuanced analysis' normally takes no article when speaking of the concept in general. If referring to a particular piece of nuanced analysis, 'the nuanced analysis' would be used. In this sentence, omitting the article is most natural.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a): provide the correct phrase that fits grammatically and stylistically.
খ. Fill blank (b): choose the correct determiner/pronoun before 'carbon footprint'.
গ. Fill blank (c): choose the correct article before 'car'.
ঘ. Fill blank (d): provide the correct gerund/phrase to introduce 'public transport'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a form of
খ our
গ a
ঘ using

Explanation:
ক: 'a form of' is the natural collocation: 'not merely a form of exercise' — this phrase clarifies that walking is more than just exercise.

খ: 'our carbon footprint' fits because the sentence addresses society's collective emissions; 'the' would be less personal, and 'one's' would be more formal/general.

গ: 'a car' is the correct indefinite article for a single, nonspecific car preference.

ঘ: 'using public transport' uses the gerund 'using' to indicate the action that could be more eco-friendly; it links the clause smoothly and grammatically ('although using public transport...').

Question:
As urban populations swell, securing reliable water supplies for cities and industry becomes a pressing challenge. Planners must balance demand management, infrastructure upgrades and climate risks to ensure communities have safe water for decades to come. The following passage highlights key choices that decision‑makers face.

Options:
ক. Fill (a) in the passage: "meeting (a) ———— rising demand for potable water"
খ. Fill (b) in the passage: "Conservation is (b) ———— immediate strategy"
গ. Fill (c) in the passage: "infrastructure investment requires (c) ———— long‑term planning"
ঘ. Fill (d) in the passage: "rainfall patterns may become (d) ———— unpredictable"


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক the
খ an
গ a
ঘ increasingly

Explanation:
ক — "the": The phrase "meeting the rising demand" uses the definite article because we refer to a specific, known trend (the rising demand). "Meeting a rising demand" would be possible but changes nuance to any unspecified rise.

খ — "an": "an immediate strategy" requires the indefinite article "an" before a vowel sound; it indicates one of the first responses. "Conservation is immediate strategy" would be ungrammatical.

গ — "a": The noun phrase "a long‑term planning" is slightly awkward; the intended structure is "requires a long‑term plan" or "requires long‑term planning." Here the blank is best filled with "a" if the following word is "long‑term plan", or omitted if using "requires long‑term planning." Given the provided prompt, "a long‑term planning" is nonstandard, so the natural fill is "a" assuming "a long‑term plan" is implied.

ঘ — "increasingly": "Become increasingly unpredictable" is the common collocation: "increasingly" modifies the adjective "unpredictable" to show that unpredictability is growing over time. Alternatives like "more" are possible but "increasingly" is stylistically stronger and idiomatic.

Options:
ক. Fill (a): "Transitioning will require (a) ———— shift in technology and behavior"
খ. Fill (b): "Electric vehicles are (b) ———— part of the solution"
গ. Fill (c): "only if electricity is (c) ———— generated from low‑carbon sources"
ঘ. Fill (d): "Policies must be crafted to avoid (d) ———— unintended social harms"


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a fundamental
খ a key
গ predominantly
ঘ causing

Explanation:
ক — "a fundamental": The phrase "a fundamental shift" is idiomatic to describe deep, structural changes in technology and behavior. "Fundamental" emphasizes the scale of change required.

খ — "a key": "a key part of the solution" is a common collocation indicating something is important but not the only element. "An integral" or "a major" could also work, but "a key" is concise and clear.

গ — "predominantly": The sentence implies that EVs reduce emissions only when the electricity that charges them comes largely from low‑carbon sources. "Predominantly generated" conveys that the majority of generation should be low‑carbon. Alternatives like "primarily" would also fit.

ঘ — "causing": "Avoid causing unintended social harms" uses the gerund "causing" after "avoid" to indicate the action policies should prevent. Other verbs (e.g., "creating") are possible, but "causing" directly links policy choices to adverse outcomes to be avoided.

Options:
ক. Fill (a): "Reducing (a) ———— dependence on synthetic fertilizers is a priority"
খ. Fill (b): "Regenerative methods can be (b) ———— effective at restoring soil organic matter"
গ. Fill (c): "However, some alternatives demand (c) ———— more labor or time"
ঘ. Fill (d): "Precision agriculture aims to apply nutrients (d) ———— where they are needed"


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক excessive
খ highly
গ significantly
ঘ precisely

Explanation:
ক — "excessive": "Excessive dependence" conveys an unhealthy or unsustainable level of reliance on synthetic fertilizers that can lead to pollution and soil decline. "Reducing dependence" without "excessive" is weaker in tone.

খ — "highly": "Highly effective" is the standard collocation to indicate strong positive results. "Very effective" could be used but "highly" is slightly more formal and fits the register.

গ — "significantly": The adverb "significantly" modifies "more labor or time" to indicate a substantial increase in resource requirements, which is often true of some low‑input or organic approaches.

ঘ — "precisely": "Apply nutrients precisely where they are needed" captures the goal of precision agriculture: to target inputs at the right place and time for efficiency and reduced runoff. Words like "only" or "exactly" could work, but "precisely" is idiomatic here.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

Explanation:
ক: "comprehensive" (বিস্তৃত/পূর্ণাঙ্গ) ব্যবহার করলে বাক্যটি বোঝায় যে পরীক্ষাটি গভীর ও সমগ্রমুখী, যা শিক্ষার্থীর দক্ষতা ও প্রয়োজন নিরূপণের জন্য উপযুক্ত।

খ: "individual" (ব্যক্তিগত) ব্যবহার করে বোঝানো হয়েছে যে বিষয়বস্তু শিক্ষার্থীদের ব্যক্তিগত পটভূমি ও শিখনশৈলীর সঙ্গে খাপ খায়। এটি collective শব্দের পরিবর্তে উপযুক্ত কারণ পরিকল্পনা ব্যক্তিভিত্তিক অভিযোজনের কথা বলছে।

গ: "separate" (অলাদা) এখানে ব্যবহার করে স্পষ্ট করা হয়েছে যে অনেকে বিষয়বিষয়ক নির্বাচন ও মূল্যায়নকে আলাদা কাজ হিসেবে দেখে — যা সমন্বয়ের অভাব নির্দেশ করে।

ঘ: "alignment" (সামঞ্জস্য/সঙ্গতি) ব্যবহার করলে বাক্যটি স্পষ্ট হয়: মূল্যায়ন পদ্ধতি ও বিষয়বস্তুর মধ্যে সঙ্গতি প্রয়োজন, যাতে শেখানোর বিষয়বস্তু ও মূল্যায়নের লক্ষ্য একই থাকে। এই শব্দটি শিক্ষাগত পরিকল্পনা ও মূল্যায়নের টেকসই সংযোগকে নির্দেশ করে।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "afterthought"

গ উত্তর: "construct" 
ঘ উত্তর: "alignment"

Explanation:
ক: "afterthought" (পরে মনে পড়া, পরবর্তীতে যুক্ত করা) দিয়ে বোঝানো হচ্ছে শিক্ষকমহলে মূল্যায়নকে প্রায়ই 'বাঁধা দেয়া' কাজে পরিণত করা হয়, অর্থাৎ আগে থেকে পরিকল্পনায় অন্তর্ভুক্ত করা হয় না।

খ: "curriculum" (পাঠ্যসূচী/কোর্সবিষয়) এখানে অর্থবহ কারণ পাঠ্যবস্তু ও শেখানোর কৌশল একসঙ্গে পরিকল্পিত হলে মূল্যায়নও লক্ষ্যবহ হবে।

গ: "construct" (গঠন/ধারণা) একটি টেকনিক্যাল শব্দ; "construct validity" মানে যে মূল্যায়ন যেটা মাপার কথা, সেটাই মাপছে। তাই বাক্যে এটি ব্যবহার করলে প্রাসঙ্গিক বৈজ্ঞানিক অর্থ আসে — পরিকল্পনা ও মূল্যায়ন একসাথে করলে ধারনাগত বৈধতা নিশ্চিত হয়।

ঘ: "alignment" (সঙ্গতি) শব্দটি যুক্ত করলে বাক্যটিতে পাঠ্যবস্তু, মূল্যায়ন ও উদ্দেশ্যের মধ্যে মিলের প্রয়োজনীয়তা জোরদার হবে। উপরের তিনটি উত্তর দিয়ে মিল রেখে বোঝানো হয়েছে যে মূল্যায়ন অনিবার্যভাবে পাঠ্য ও পরিকল্পনার অংশ হওয়া উচিত।

Explanation:
ক (a = a): বাক্যটি বলছে 'Early childhood is (a) ———— stage in a person's life.' এখানে অনির্দিষ্ট একটি পর্যায় বোঝাতে 'a stage' সঠিক।

খ (b = this): 'During (b) ———— time parents lay...' এখানে নির্দিষ্টভাবে সেই প্রারম্ভিক সময়ই বোঝানো হচ্ছে, তাই 'this time' অর্থগতভাবে ঠিক।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: "alignment" 
খ উত্তর: "separate" 
গ উত্তর: "component" 
ঘ উত্তর: "improved"

Explanation:
ক: "alignment" (সঙ্গতি) এখানে উপযুক্ত কারণ এটি নির্দেশ করে যে বিষয়বস্তু ও মূল্যায়ন একে অন্যের সঙ্গে সঙ্গত হলে ফলাফলগুলি অর্থপূর্ণভাবে ব্যাখ্যা করা যায়।

খ: "separate" (অলাদা) ব্যবহার করে বলা হচ্ছে শিক্ষার্থীর মূল্যায়নকে যদি শেখানোর কার্যক্রম থেকে আলাদা ধরা হয়, তখন ফলাফলগুলির ব্যাখ্যা ও ব্যবহার সীমিত হয়।

গ: "component" (অংশ/উপাদান) উল্লেখ করে যে মূল্যায়ন একক উপাদান নয় বরং শিক্ষা প্রক্রিয়ার অভিন্ন অংশ — পাঠ্য, কৌশল, এবং মূল্যায়ন একসঙ্গে কাজ করে।

ঘ: "improved" (উন্নত/সुधারিত) যুক্ত করলে বাক্যটি বোঝায় যে সমন্বিত পরিকল্পনা ও মূল্যায়ন শিক্ষার্থীর অর্জনে উন্নতি নিয়ে আসে। অন্য সমার্থক শব্দও ব্যবহৃত হতে পারে (উদাহরণ: "better" বা "enhanced"), কিন্তু "improved" স্পষ্টভাবে ফলাফলগত উন্নতির দিকটি তুলে ধরে।

গ (c = such): ' (c) ———— praise can boost...'—এক্ষেত্রে 'such praise' অর্থাৎ 'এমন ধরনের প্রশংসা' ব্যবহার করলে বাক্যটি স্বাভাবিক পড়ে; 'the praise' দিলে দ্বিতীয়াংশ বিভ্রান্ত হতে পারে।

ঘ (d = a): 'given (d) ———— fair opportunity'—অর্থ হলো 'একটি ন্যায্য সুযোগ', যা সাধারণ ভাষায় 'a fair opportunity' বলে দেওয়া হয়।

Options:
ক. (a) ———— কী বসবে?

ঘ. (d) ———— কী বসবে?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: the
খ উত্তর: the
গ উত্তর: about the
ঘ উত্তর: the

Explanation:
ক (a = the): 'develops in (a) ———— home environment'—এখানে সাধারণভাবে কিন্তু নির্দিষ্ট প্রেক্ষাপটে 'the home environment' ব্যবহার করা হয় কারণ কথকটি ঐ নির্দিষ্ট পরিবেশকে বোঝাচ্ছে।

খ (b = the): 'and (b) ———— community around him'—এখানেও একই যুক্তি; ঐ নির্দিষ্ট বা পরিবেশগত সম্প্রদায়কে বোঝাতে 'the community' সঠিক।

গ (c = about the): 'Parents often worry (c) ———— child's future'—ইংরেজিতে 'worry about the child's future' বলে, তাই 'about the' সম্পূর্ণ ফ্রেজ প্রয়োজন।

ঘ (d = the): 'prepare (d) ———— child carefully'—এখানে ঐ নির্দিষ্ট শিশুকে (their child বা the child) প্রস্তুত করার কথা বলা হচ্ছে; সাধারণভাবে 'the child' উপযুক্ত।

Question:
As cities expand and electric vehicle adoption accelerates, energy planners face a complex challenge: meeting higher peak loads while accommodating intermittent generation. Smart grids, demand-response programs and storage technologies can help smooth (a) _____ swings in supply and demand. Yet deploying these solutions at scale will require (b) _____ political will and long-term financing. In the short term, fossil fuels may still play (c) _____ role in ensuring reliability, but their environmental costs make that option (d) _____ undesirable.

গ. ভরাট (c)‑এর জন্য উপযুক্ত শব্দটি দিন
ঘ. ভরাট (d)‑এর জন্য উপযুক্ত শব্দটি দিন


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: the
খ উত্তর: significant
গ উত্তর: a
ঘ উত্তর: increasingly

Explanation:
ক (a = the): ইংরেজিতে নির্দিষ্ট দারুণ বা পরিচিত swings বোঝাতে 'the' ব্যবহার করা হয় — here we refer to the particular supply-and-demand swings just mentioned. খ (b = significant): 'political will and long-term financing' এর পরিমাণ বা গুরুত্ব বোঝাতে 'significant'—'substantial' বা 'considerable'-ও হতে পারে; 'significant' context-appropriate এবং স্বল্প-দৈর্ঘ্যের অনুষঙ্গটি মেনে চলে। গ (c = a): 'play a role' শব্দসমষ্টি ইংরেজিতে প্রচলিত; indefinite article 'a' প্রয়োজন। ঘ (d = increasingly): বাক্যটি তুলনামূলকভাবে সময়ের সাথে খারাপ হওয়া বোঝাচ্ছে — 'increasingly undesirable' মানে ক্রমেই কম পছন্দনীয়; 'increasingly' একটি adverb যা 'undesirable' শ্রেণির adjective modify করে। বিকল্পভাবে 'ever more' বা 'progressively' ব্যবহার করা যেত, কিন্তু 'increasingly' সবচেয়ে স্বাভাবিক।

গ. ভরাট (c)‑এর জন্য উপযুক্ত শব্দটি দিন
ঘ. ভরাট (d)‑এর জন্য উপযুক্ত শব্দটি দিন


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: highly
খ উত্তর: regular
গ উত্তর: clear
ঘ উত্তর: chronically

Explanation:
ক (a = highly): 'highly reliable microgrids' is a common collocation emphasizing strong reliability; alternatives like 'very' are possible but 'highly' is idiomatic. খ (b = regular): onderhoud/maintenance ের জন্য 'regular maintenance regimes' মানে পর্যায়ক্রমিক ও নিয়মিত রক্ষণাবেক্ষণ; 'adequate' বা 'consistent' হতে পারত, কিন্তু 'regular' এখানে উপযুক্ত। গ (c = clear): 'clear regulatory frameworks'—নিয়ম-কানুন ও নীতিমালা যেন অস্পষ্ট না হয়; 'predictable' ও 'stable' ও ব্যবহার করা যেতে পারে; এখানে 'clear' বিশেষ করে নির্দেশনা ও অনুমোদন প্রক্রিয়ার স্বচ্ছতা বোঝায়। ঘ (d = chronically): 'chronically underutilized or abandoned' নির্দেশ করে যে প্রকল্পগুলি নিয়মিতভাবে কম ব্যবহার বা পরিত্যক্ত হয়, ক্রমাগত বা দীর্ঘমেয়াদি সমস্যা বোঝাতে 'chronically' ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে; 'ultimately' বা 'frequently' বিকল্প হতে পারে কিন্তু 'chronically' অর্থগতভাবে শক্তিশালী এবং প্রাসঙ্গিক।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: a
খ উত্তর: erode
গ উত্তর: essential
ঘ উত্তর: vulnerable

Explanation:
ক (a = a): 'act as a signal'—এই অভিব্যক্তিটির সঙ্গে indefinite article 'a' সাধারণ ব্যবহার। 'an' লাগবে না কারণ 'signal' শব্দটি শব্দের শুরুতে consonant sound। খ (b = erode): 'public acceptance may erode quickly'—'erode' মানে আস্থা কমে যাওয়া; বাক্যে temporal fragility বোঝাতে উপযুক্ত। বিকল্প হিসেবে 'wane' ব্যবহার করেছিলেও চলে। গ (c = essential): 'are essential to ensure a just transition'—এই ক্ষেত্রে 'essential' সবচেয়ে শক্তিশালী এবং স্পষ্ট; 'critical' বা 'necessary' ও ব্যবহারযোগ্য। ঘ (d = vulnerable): 'the climate agenda risks being vulnerable politically' বোঝায় যে রাজনীতিতে এটি সহজে আঘাতপ্রাপ্ত বা ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হতে পারে; 'politically vulnerable' প্রচলিত collocation. বিকল্প 'derailed' বা 'undermined' হতে পারত, কিন্তু 'vulnerable' বাক্যের গঠন রক্ষা করে।

Options:
ক. Blank (a): Which article/determiner fits before "old"?
খ. Blank (b): Which article fits before "attic"?
গ. Blank (c): Which article fits before "abandoned house"?
ঘ. Blank (d): Which article fits before "fortune"?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক an
খ the
গ an
ঘ a

Explanation:
ক (an): Use "an" before a word that begins with a vowel sound. "Old" begins with the vowel sound /o:/, so "an old, dusty book" is correct.

খ (the): "The attic of the abandoned house" refers to a specific attic belonging to that particular house. Use the definite article "the" for something identifiable or specific.

গ (an): "Abandoned" begins with a vowel sound (/ə/), and we are introducing a house that is not previously specified, so "an abandoned house" is appropriate.

ঘ (a): "Fortune" here means "a large amount of wealth" (countable in this sense as a single unspecified thing). We introduce it for the first time, so the indefinite article "a" is used: "a fortune."

ক. Blank (a): Which article fits before "scientist"?
খ. Blank (b): Which article fits before "new element"?
গ. Blank (c): Which article fits before "beginning"?
ঘ. Blank (d): Which article fits before "revolution in chemistry"?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a
খ a
গ the
ঘ a

Explanation:
ক (a): We are introducing one scientist among many, so the indefinite article "a" is used: "a scientist."

খ (a): "New element" is being mentioned for the first time and begins with a consonant sound (/n/), so "a new element" is correct.

গ (the): When we say "the beginning," we refer to a specific start-point of the following event (the discovery led specifically to that start), so the definite article "the" is appropriate: "the beginning of ..."

ঘ (a): "A revolution in chemistry" means one revolution (a significant change) among possible changes. It's introduced as an indefinite, countable event, so use "a." The full phrase: "the beginning of a revolution in chemistry."

খ. Blank (b): Which article fits before "lake"?
গ. Blank (c): Which article fits before "tall coconut trees"?
ঘ. Blank (d): Which article fits before the place-name "Mirror of Sky"?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক an
খ a
গ the
ঘ the

Explanation:
ক (an): Use "an" before words starting with a vowel sound. "Island" begins with the vowel sound /aɪ/, so "an island" is correct.

খ (a): We are introducing one lake on that island, not previously specified, so the indefinite article "a" is appropriate: "a lake."

গ (the): "The tall coconut trees" identifies a specific group of trees that are surrounding that lake; since they are definite in this context (the ones around the lake), "the" is used.

ঘ (the): When giving a specific name or nickname to a place ("Mirror of Sky"), we commonly use the definite article: "the 'Mirror of Sky'" — it refers to that particular named lake.

খ. Blank (b) কে পূরণ করো
গ. Blank (c) কে পূরণ করো
ঘ. Blank (d) কে পূরণ করো


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: (a) the — "a calm evening is the perfect opportunity" because we refer to a specific opportunity within the given context.
খ উত্তর: (b) a — "pick up a newspaper" uses the indefinite article because any one newspaper is meant, not a specific paper already known.
গ উত্তর: (c) a — "pick up a novel" similarly takes the indefinite article since it refers to any novel.
ঘ উত্তর: (d) the — "sharpens the vocabulary" uses the definite article because we speak about vocabulary in general as a known concept related to the person reading.

Explanation:
ক: এখানে নির্দিষ্ট সময়ে (that particular time) যে সুযোগ বলা হচ্ছে, তাই 'the' ব্যবহার করি — 'the perfect opportunity'.
খ ও গ: যখন আমরা সাধারণ কোনো একক জিনিস বোঝাই (যেমন কোনো পত্রিকা বা কোনো উপন্যাস), তখন 'a' (indefinite article) ব্যবহার করা উচিত: 'a newspaper', 'a novel'.
ঘ: 'vocabulary' এখানে সাধারণভাবে একটি পরিচিত ধারণা হিসেবে এসেছে — কোনো শিক্ষার্থীর বা ব্যক্তির 'the vocabulary' উন্নত হয়; বাক্যে নির্দিষ্ট অর্থে 'the' ব্যবহার উপযুক্ত।

খ. Blank (b) পূরণ করো
গ. Blank (c) পূরণ করো
ঘ. Blank (d) পূরণ করো


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: (a) the — 'the coach' because we refer to a specific coach already understood in context (the team's coach).
খ উত্তর: a — 'a quick meeting' uses the indefinite article as it is one meeting among possible meetings, not previously specified.
গ উত্তর: the — 'the importance of teamwork' uses 'the' because we are talking about a specific, known concept: the importance that was being emphasized.
ঘ উত্তর: the — 'the captain' uses 'the' since within a team there is a particular captain known to all; he is a specific person.

Explanation:
ক: 'coach' কথনটিতে নির্দিষ্ট ব্যক্তিকে নির্দেশ করা হয়েছে (টিমের কোচ), তাই 'the coach' সঠিক।
খ: 'quick meeting' এখানে নতুন একটী সভার কথা বলা হয়েছে, পূর্বপরিচিত নয় — তাই 'a quick meeting'।
গ: 'importance of teamwork' হলো একটি পরিচিত ধারণা বা নির্দিষ্ট বিষয় যা কোচ উল্লেখ করছেন, তাই 'the importance'।
ঘ: 'captain' টিমের নির্দিষ্ট নেতা; সবাই যে ক্যাপ্টেনটিরই কথা বলছে, সেইজনকে বোঝাতে 'the captain' ব্যবহার করা হয়।

Options:
ক. Blank (a) পূরণ করো
খ. Blank (b) পূরণ করো
গ. Blank (c) পূরণ করো
ঘ. Blank (d) পূরণ করো


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: (a) the — 'the volunteers' because the sentence refers to a particular group taking part in the drive.
খ উত্তর: — (no article) — 'plastic bottles' in plural often takes no article when speaking generally about such items.
গ উত্তর: an — 'an enormous amount of waste' uses 'an' because 'enormous' begins with a vowel sound and we refer to a singular quantity expression 'an amount'.
ঘ উত্তর: the — 'the shoreline' refers to a specific shoreline (the one near the clean-up site), so the definite article is appropriate.

Explanation:
ক: এখানে নির্দিষ্ট কর্মসূচির অংশ হিসেবে যে স্বেচ্ছাসেবীদের কথা বলা হচ্ছে, তারা পরিচিতভাবে 'the volunteers' হয়।
খ: 'plastic bottles' যদি সাধারণভাবে বোঝানো হয় (প্লাস্টিক বোতলগুলো), বিশেষ কোনো নির্দিষ্ট বোতল না বোঝালে কোনো article লাগেনা।
গ: 'enormous amount' শব্দযুগল 'an amount' — 'enormous' স্বরবর্ণ দিয়ে শুরু হওয়ায় 'an' লাগে: 'an enormous amount of waste'.
ঘ: 'shoreline' এখানে সেই নির্দিষ্ট তীররেখার কথা বলা হচ্ছে যেখানেই পরিচ্ছন্নতা অভিযান হচ্ছে, তাই 'the shoreline' যথার্থ।

ঘ a small vegetable patch

Explanation:
ক: We use the indefinite article "a" before a singular, nonspecific noun beginning with a consonant sound: "a field by the river." খ: The fixed idiom is "at the crack of dawn," so we use the definite article "the". গ: If a particular ox that helps plough is intended (he tends that specific working animal), use the definite article "the ox." ঘ: "a small vegetable patch" uses the indefinite article "a" because the patch is being introduced as one among possible patches and is not previously specified.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

ঘ a short explanation

Explanation:
ক: "a boy" introduces an unspecified singular child (indefinite article). খ: "some information" is natural because "information" is an uncountable noun and often takes "some" when unspecified quantity or type is meant. গ: "a pair of binoculars" is the usual phrase for binoculars treated as a single item; "a pair" is idiomatic. ঘ: "a short explanation" uses the indefinite article because the explanation is being introduced for the first time and is not previously specified.

Explanation:
ক: "an extensive collection" uses "an" because the following word "extensive" begins with a vowel sound; the phrase describes the scope of the collection. খ: "from afar" is an idiomatic adverbial phrase meaning "from distant places." গ: "an individual glass case" uses "an" before "individual" (vowel sound) and introduces each case as a single item. ঘ: "the soft LED lights" uses the definite article because we refer to the specific lighting used to illuminate and protect the exhibited pieces.

Options:
ক. Rashed is ___ English teacher in ___ small school.
খ. He goes to school by ___ bicycle every morning.
গ. There is ___ river beside the school called ___ Surma.
ঘ. Many students dream of becoming ___ doctor or ___ engineer.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Rashed is an English teacher in a small school.
খ He goes to school by bicycle every morning.
গ There is a river beside the school called the Surma.
ঘ Many students dream of becoming a doctor or an engineer.

Explanation:
ক: Use 'an' before 'English' because 'English' begins with a vowel sound. Use 'a' before 'small school' because it is a nonspecific singular noun.

খ: With modes of transport, English commonly uses 'by' without an article (by bicycle, by car, by bus) to indicate means of travel; 'on a bicycle' or 'by bicycle' are both possible, but 'by bicycle' is more idiomatic here.

গ: 'a river' introduces an unspecified river near the school. When naming the river, use the definite article 'the Surma' because specific geographic names with nouns like 'river' or well-known names often take 'the' (the Nile, the Thames; 'the Surma' is idiomatic).

ঘ: 'a doctor' is used before consonant sounds; 'an engineer' is used before the vowel sound at the start of 'engineer'. When listing career aspirations individually, use the appropriate indefinite article for each noun.

গ. Her team is building ___ cloud-based application for small businesses.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Shahana joined a startup in Dhaka last month.
খ She lives in an apartment near the lake.
গ Her team is building a cloud-based application for small businesses.
ঘ Every Friday they have a meeting with a client from London.

Explanation:
ক: Use 'a' before 'startup' because it is a singular, non-specific noun and 'startup' begins with a consonant sound.

খ: 'an apartment' — use 'an' because 'apartment' begins with a vowel sound. 'near the lake' — 'the' is used because 'the lake' refers to a specific, identifiable lake in the local context.

গ: 'a cloud-based application' — 'a' introduces one (nonspecific) application; 'cloud-based' begins with a consonant sound so 'a' is correct.

ঘ: 'a meeting' introduces one session (nonspecific). 'a client from London' — the client is not previously identified, so use the indefinite article 'a'. If the sentence referred to a previously mentioned or known client, 'the client' would be used.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক For the tour he booked a boat from a local operator.
খ He read about the Sundarbans in a travel magazine.
গ Locals warned him about the tides and the sudden weather changes.
ঘ Before leaving he bought a map and a list of emergency contacts.

Explanation:
ক: 'a boat' is used because Amin booked one unspecified boat among many available options; indefinite article is appropriate.

খ: 'the Sundarbans' — we use 'the' with names of unique geographic regions like 'the Sundarbans'. 'a travel magazine' — any one magazine (nonspecific) where he read the article, so use 'a'.

গ: 'the tides' — referring to the specific local tidal phenomenon, so definite article 'the' is appropriate. 'the sudden weather changes' — these are particular weather events the locals have in mind, hence 'the'. If speaking of sudden weather changes in general, one could omit 'the', but context here indicates particular local phenomena.

ঘ: 'a map' and 'a list of emergency contacts' — both are singular, nonspecific items he purchased in preparation; use the indefinite article 'a'.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক the (lives on the eighth floor)খ an (an old apartment)গ the (the Bay of Bengal)ঘ no article / — (loves music)

Explanation:
ক (the): We use 'the' with 'eighth floor' because it refers to a specific floor of a particular building (definite reference). খ (an): 'old' begins with a vowel sound, so the correct indefinite article is 'an' before 'old apartment'. গ (the): Names of seas and large bodies of water take 'the' (the Bay of Bengal). ঘ (no article): When we talk about musical activities in general ("love music"), we do not use an article. If we meant the instrument specifically ("the piano" meaning the instrument in that household), we would use 'the piano', but for the general activity 'music' we use no article.

Question:
One morning we hired (a)______ speedboat to cross (b)_____ Gomati River. On the far bank we met (c)_____ old fisherman who was selling (d)_____ fresh hilsa.

Options:
ক. ফাঁক (a)–এ কোন আর্টিকেল বসবে?
খ. ফাঁক (b)–এ কোন আর্টিকেল বসবে?
গ. ফাঁক (c)–এ কোন আর্টিকেল বসবে?
ঘ. ফাঁক (d)–এ কোন আর্টিকেল বা determiner বসবে?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a (a speedboat)খ the (the Gomati River)গ an (an old fisherman)ঘ a (a fresh hilsa)

Explanation:
ক (a): 'speedboat' begins with a consonant sound, and it's mentioned nonspecifically for the first time, so use 'a'. খ (the): When a specific river is named (Gomati River), English typically uses 'the' before the river name. গ (an): 'old' begins with a vowel sound, so the correct form is 'an old fisherman'. ঘ (a): 'fresh hilsa' is an indefinite, countable item in this context (we bought one fish), so 'a fresh hilsa' is appropriate. If a non-count sense or plural were intended, other determiners would be used (e.g., 'some fresh hilsa').

গ. ফাঁক (c)–এ কোন আর্টিকেল বসবে?
ঘ. ফাঁক (d)–এ কোন আর্টিকেল/determiner বসবে?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a (a unique display)খ no article / — (bronze statuettes)গ the (the Mughal era)ঘ a (a glass case)

Explanation:
ক (a): 'unique' starts with a 'y' consonant sound ('yu-'), so the correct indefinite article is 'a unique'. খ (no article): When speaking of a class or material in general ("bronze statuettes" as a type or plural noun), no article is needed. If it were a specific set, 'the bronze statuettes' would be used. গ (the): Historical periods like 'Mughal era' typically take 'the' when referenced as a specific period (the Mughal era). ঘ (a): Each individual item is kept in 'a glass case'—nonspecific and singular—so 'a' is appropriate; if referring to a particular, already-mentioned case, 'the glass case' could be used instead.

Question:
A responsible student keeps a clear record of his habits and studies. He fills (a) —— notebook every evening with what he has learned. He strictly follows (b) —— timetable set by his teacher. He nourishes (c) —— ambition to become a helpful citizen. His conduct makes him (d) —— example in his class.

Options:
ক. (a) শূন্যস্থানটি পূরণ করুন
খ. (b) শূন্যস্থানটি পূরণ করুন
গ. (c) শূন্যস্থানটি পূরণ করুন
ঘ. (d) শূন্যস্থানটি পূরণ করুন


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: 'a' — He fills a notebook every evening because we mean one notebook among many (indefinite article). খ উত্তর: 'the' — He follows the timetable set by his teacher; 'the' specifies that particular timetable already mentioned or known. গ উত্তর: 'an' — He nourishes an ambition; 'ambition' begins with a vowel sound so the indefinite article 'an' is required. ঘ উত্তর: 'an' — He is an example in his class; 'example' begins with a vowel sound, so 'an' is correct.

Explanation:
ক — Use 'a' before a singular, countable noun beginning with a consonant sound when it is not specific: 'a notebook' means one (unspecified) notebook. খ — 'the timetable' refers to the specific schedule established by the teacher; when both speaker and listener know which timetable is meant, use 'the'. গ — 'ambition' begins with a vowel sound (/æ/), therefore the correct indefinite article is 'an'. Also, 'an ambition' means one particular aim or desire (unspecified). ঘ — 'example' starts with a vowel sound (/ɪ/), so 'an example' is grammatically correct. In contexts where we refer to someone who serves as a model for others, 'an example' is idiomatic (e.g., 'an example to his classmates'). Together these choices follow standard English article usage: 'a/an' for indefinite singular nouns and 'the' for definite, specific nouns.

Question:
In a cooperative neighbourhood everyone learns to respect one another. There should always be (a) —— person ready to listen when others are in trouble. Good citizens take (b) —— responsibility for keeping parks and streets clean. They speak (c) —— truth to bring about fairness. Small caring acts often lead to (d) —— large improvements over time.

Options:

খ. (b) শূন্যস্থানটি পূরণ করুন
গ. (c) শূন্যস্থানটি পূরণ করুন
ঘ. (d) শূন্যস্থানটি পূরণ করুন


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: 'a' — 'a person' (an unspecified individual ready to help). খ উত্তর: 'the' — 'the responsibility' refers to the specific duty of keeping parks and streets clean (definite and understood). গ উত্তর: 'the' — 'the truth' is used idiomatically when referring to honesty in general. ঘ উত্তর: 'a' — 'a large improvement' (here 'a' signals one significant improvement among possible outcomes).

Explanation:
ক — Use 'a' for a non-specific, singular person: 'a person' indicates any individual willing to listen. খ — 'the responsibility' is definite because we are naming a particular duty shared by good citizens (keeping public spaces clean); readers understand which responsibility is meant. গ — In English, 'to speak the truth' is the fixed idiom; 'the truth' is used to denote honesty in a general, definite sense. ঘ — 'a large improvement' uses the indefinite article 'a' to indicate one notable positive change; the sentence means small acts can accumulate into one or more substantial improvements. Overall, the choices follow idiomatic uses and the rule that 'a/an' introduce non-specific singular nouns while 'the' points to definite, known concepts or idiomatic expressions.

Question:
A committed volunteer contributes time and energy for public welfare. She helps at (a) —— community kitchen twice a week. She does not seek praise; she acts from (b) —— sincere feeling of service. Her small efforts create (c) —— ripple effect, encouraging others. We hope that many people will join and become (d) —— force for positive change.

Options:

খ. (b) শূন্যস্থানটি পূরণ করুন
গ. (c) শূন্যস্থানটি পূরণ করুন
ঘ. (d) শূন্যস্থানটি পূরণ করুন


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: 'the' — 'the community kitchen' refers to that specific local kitchen where she volunteers. খ উত্তর: 'a' — 'a sincere feeling' (an indefinite, singular feeling motivating her actions). গ উত্তর: 'a' — 'a ripple effect' (one effect among many possible outcomes; indefinite article fits). ঘ উত্তর: 'a' — 'a force for positive change' (she and others collectively become a driving power; 'a' is appropriate before a singular, countable noun phrase used generically).

Explanation:
ক — 'the community kitchen' is definite because the sentence specifies the particular community kitchen where she volunteers (local and known in context). খ — Use 'a' with 'sincere feeling' to indicate one of many possible feelings that motivate service; the feeling is not previously specified, so the indefinite article is correct. গ — 'a ripple effect' describes one emergent consequence of many small actions; the indefinite article emphasizes that it is one such effect. ঘ — 'a force for positive change' treats the collective action as a singular influential power; 'a' introduces this general, countable concept. These selections follow the standard article rules: choose 'the' for particular, contextually known nouns or idiomatic references, and 'a/an' for non-specific, singular nouns or when introducing a concept for the first time.

Question:
Honesty, though often tested, remains (a) — foundation of all (b) — relationships. Without (c) — trust, (d) — reliance on others becomes impossible.

Options:
ক. Blank (a): choose the correct article or determiner
খ. Blank (b): choose whether an article is needed and the correct number/form
গ. Blank (c): choose the correct article/determiner (if any)
ঘ. Blank (d): choose the correct determiner or quantifier


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক the খ x (no article; plural: relationships) গ x (no article; trust is uncountable here) ঘ any

Explanation:
ক (the): 'Honesty ... remains the foundation' — we use 'the' because we refer to a specific abstract concept (the single foundation).

খ (x/no article): 'foundation of all relationships' — after 'all' we do not use another article; 'relationships' is plural and generic.

গ (x/no article): 'Without trust' — 'trust' is an uncountable noun referring to the general idea, so no article is needed.

ঘ (any): 'any reliance on others becomes impossible' — 'any' emphasises that no amount/type of reliance is possible without trust; 'the reliance' would be less natural in this generic statement.

Options:
ক. Blank (a): choose the correct article
খ. Blank (b): choose the correct article before 'reader'
গ. Blank (c): choose the correct adjective/determiner for 'attention'
ঘ. Blank (d): choose the correct determiner for 'studies'


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a খ the গ close ঘ their

Explanation:
ক (a): 'A good book is a friend' — indefinite article 'a' introduces one such friend among many.

খ (the): 'never deserts the reader' — 'the reader' refers to the typical/definite reader in general statements; 'the' is used to generalize a class.

গ (close): 'give close attention' — 'close attention' is the common collocation meaning careful focus; other words like 'full' might work but 'close' is idiomatic.

ঘ (their): 'their studies' — 'their' is a gender-neutral plural possessive appropriate for 'students'; 'the studies' would be less natural and 'his/her' is less inclusive.

Options:
ক. Blank (a): choose the correct article
খ. Blank (b): choose the correct article before 'scarce commodity'
গ. Blank (c): choose the correct determiner for 'personal data'
ঘ. Blank (d): choose the correct determiner for 'passwords'


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক the খ a গ their (or one's) ঘ their

Explanation:
ক (the): 'In the age of information' — we use 'the' because we refer to the specific era defined by information technology.

খ (a): 'a scarce commodity' — 'scarce commodity' is singular and indefinite, so 'a' is appropriate.

গ (their / one's): 'protect their personal data' — 'their' is the natural plural, gender-neutral possessive referring back to 'people'. 'One's' is also grammatically correct but less conversational when referring to people generally.

ঘ (their): 'should not share their passwords' — again 'their' is the inclusive possessive matching 'people'; 'the passwords' would imply a specific set of passwords, which is not intended.

Question:
Rita was rushing to catch an early train to the city. The short passage below describes what happened. Complete each numbered sub-question by supplying the correct prepositions.

Options:
ক. Rita arrived ___ the station ___ 8 a.m.
খ. She ran ___ the platform and jumped ___ the train.
গ. She kept her bag ___ her lap ___ the journey.
ঘ. She waved ___ her friend ___ the window as the train moved off.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক at; at — Rita arrived at the station at 8 a.m. (use 'arrive at' for places like stations; 'at' for clock times). 
খ across; onto — She ran across the platform and jumped onto the train. ('across' describes moving from one side to the other over the platform; 'onto' indicates movement to a position on the train). 
গ on; during — She kept her bag on her lap during the journey. ('on' shows position resting on the lap; 'during' indicates the time-span of the journey). 
ঘ to; from — She waved to her friend from the window as the train moved off. ('wave to' is the typical collocation; 'from the window' shows the origin of the action).

Explanation:
ক: 'arrive' usually pairs with 'at' for points/places (arrive at the station) and we use 'at' for times like '8 a.m.' — hence 'at the station at 8 a.m.'.

খ: 'run across' fits when moving over the surface of something (the platform). To indicate movement onto the train, use 'onto' (movement toward and ending up on). 'On' would indicate position but not the movement.

গ: A bag rests 'on' a lap. For the time period we use 'during the journey' to indicate throughout that period. 'For the journey' is also possible but 'during' emphasises throughout the journey.

ঘ: We 'wave to' someone (the recipient of the action). 'From the window' shows where she was when she waved. 'At the window' could describe position but 'from the window' better conveys origin of the action while the train is moving.

Question:
A family went out for a picnic by the riverside. Fill the blanks in each instruction or description using suitable prepositions.

Options:
ক. They set out ___ the morning ___ Sunday.
খ. They spread the mat ___ the grass and sat ___ it.
গ. The children ran ___ the trees ___ the butterflies.
ঘ. They returned ___ sunset, tired but happy ___ memories.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক in; on — They set out in the morning on Sunday. ('in the morning' is the idiomatic phrase; 'on Sunday' for the day).
খ on; on — They spread the mat on the grass and sat on it. ('on' indicates position atop the grass and atop the mat).
গ among; after — The children ran among the trees after the butterflies. ('among the trees' expresses movement within a group of trees; 'after' indicates pursuit).
ঘ at; with — They returned at sunset, tired but happy with memories. ('at sunset' marks that time; 'with memories' shows possession/accompaniment of feelings/memories).

Explanation:
ক: Use 'in the morning' (common English collocation) to indicate part of the day. Days take 'on' (on Sunday).

খ: 'on the grass' indicates being positioned on its surface. Both spreading the mat and sitting are actions that place someone/something on a surface, so 'on' is appropriate twice.

গ: 'among' is used when something or someone moves within a group (trees). To indicate pursuit, 'after' is the suitable preposition (they ran after butterflies).

ঘ: Times like 'sunset' are usually preceded by 'at' (at sunrise, at noon, at sunset). 'With memories' is idiomatic to show that they returned accompanied by memories — i.e., their feelings/memories came with them.

Question:
Dr. Karim gave post-operative instructions to a patient. Complete the following sentences by inserting the correct prepositions.

Options:
ক. Take the medicine ___ your meals and finish it ___ a week.
খ. Keep the wound covered ___ the daytime but let it breathe ___ night.
গ. Avoid heavy lifting ___ six weeks to allow healing ___ the tissues.
ঘ. If you feel fever ___ 38°C or notice increasing pain, report ___ the clinic immediately.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক after; within — Take the medicine after your meals and finish it within a week. ('after meals' times dosing; 'within a week' gives the allowable time span to complete the course).
খ during; at — Keep the wound covered during the daytime but let it breathe at night. ('during the daytime' for the period; 'at night' is the standard phrase).
গ for; of — Avoid heavy lifting for six weeks to allow healing of the tissues. ('for six weeks' expresses duration; 'healing of the tissues' is the natural prepositional phrase).
ঘ above; to — If you feel fever above 38°C or notice increasing pain, report to the clinic immediately. ('fever above 38°C' indicates the threshold; 'report to' a place/authority is the correct verb–preposition pair).

Explanation:
ক: 'after your meals' tells when to take the medicine relative to eating. 'Within a week' indicates that the course should be completed at some point not later than one week — a time limit.

খ: 'during the daytime' emphasizes the whole daylight period when the wound stays covered; 'at night' is the common time phrase used for nighttime.

গ: 'for six weeks' expresses the length of the restriction. 'Healing of the tissues' uses 'of' to connect the noun 'healing' with what is being healed (the tissues).

ঘ: Medical thresholds for fever are described as 'above' a temperature (or 'over'). 'Report to the clinic' is the standard collocation to indicate informing or visiting the clinic/medical authority.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

Explanation:
ক: 'essential' শব্দটি স্বরধ্বনি দিয়ে শুরু হওয়ায় এর আগে অসংজ্ঞায়ক নিবন্ধ 'an' ব্যবহার করা হবে: 'an essential area'.

খ: এখানে নির্দিষ্ট স্কুলকে বোঝানো হচ্ছে (স্কুল = আগে থেকেই প্রসঙ্গিত), তাই নির্দিষ্ট নিবন্ধ 'the' ব্যবহার করা উচিত: 'for the school'.

গ: বাক্যতে 'students ... play, run and enjoy' — ক্রিয়াগুলো করার সক্ষমতা বা অনুমতাকে বোঝাতে 'can' সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত মডাল: 'students can play'. বিকল্প হিসেবে 'may' বা 'often' ব্যবহার করলে অর্থ পরিবর্তিত হতে পারে, কিন্তু সাধারণ বিবৃতির জন্য 'can' যথাযথ।

ঘ: 'open space' কথাটির আগে অসংজ্ঞায়ক নিবন্ধ 'an' প্রয়োজন কারণ 'open' স্বরধ্বনি দিয়ে শুরু হয়: 'an open space'.

অতএব পূর্ণ বাক্যটি হবে: 'The playground is an essential area for the school where students can play, run and enjoy. It is an open space surrounded by trees.'

খ: এখানে প্রসঙ্গভিত্তিকভাবে ওই প্রতিষ্ঠানের কম্পিউটার ল্যাবকে বোঝানো হচ্ছে — তা নির্দিষ্ট; ফলে 'the school' সঠিক: 'in the school'.

গ: 'computers, printers and a projector'—কম্পিউটারগুলোর সংখ্যাটি অনিশ্চিত কিন্তু একাধিক বোঝাতে 'several' বা 'many' ব্যবহার করা যায়। সাধারণভাবে 'several' প্রাসঙ্গিক ও সংক্ষিপ্ত।

ঘ: 'projector' একটি একক উপকরণ; আগে নির্দিষ্টভাবে উল্লেখ না করলে 'a projector' ব্যবহার করা উচিত: 'a projector for teaching'.

খ: 'the students' কে সুবিধা দেয়ার ক্রিয়া বোঝাতে 'for the students' ব্যবহার করা প্রয়োজন — এখানে 'for' একটি পূর্বপদ (preposition): 'for the students'.

গ: 'Students should buy some healthy food' বলতে পরিমাণ বোঝাতে 'some' উপযুক্ত — এটি অনির্দিষ্ট পদার্থের পরিমাণ প্রকাশ করে এবং অনানুষ্ঠানিক পরামর্শ হিসেবে ভালভাবে ফিট করে।

ঘ: 'pay a reasonable price' — 'reasonable price' এখানে একটি একক ধারণা হিসেবে ব্যবহৃত হচ্ছে, তাই 'a' নিবন্ধ ব্যবহার করা হয়: 'pay a reasonable price'.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) the top floor; (b) an old building
খ (c) the central market; (d) thieves
গ (e) the main door; (f) the corridor
ঘ (g) a suspicious shadow; (h) bed

Explanation:
ক — (a) 'the top floor': we use 'the' because 'top floor' is a unique, definite position in that building; the speaker lives on that specific top floor. (b) 'an old building': 'old' begins with a vowel sound, so 'an' is required; it's nonspecific (one among many buildings). 

খ — (c) 'the central market': this is a particular market near the flat (definite), so 'the' is appropriate. (d) 'thieves': after 'worried about' we normally use the plural noun without an article when speaking generally about people of that type. Saying 'about thieves' (no article) means thieves in general. 

গ — (e) 'the main door': a specific door of their flat, so 'the'. (f) 'the corridor': we check the corridor of the building we live in (a specific corridor), so 'the' fits better than 'a'. 

ঘ — (g) 'a suspicious shadow': we use 'a' because it introduces one unspecified instance of a suspicious shadow. (h) 'bed': in everyday speech it's common to say 'go to bed' without an article. Using no article conveys the idiomatic meaning of sleeping.

খ (c) footsteps; (d) the boardwalk
গ (e) the shutters; (f) a lantern
ঘ (g) a fisherman; (h) the path

Explanation:
ক — (a) 'a cliff': the cottage is on one of many possible cliffs, so the indefinite 'a' is used. (b) 'the Atlantic': this names a specific ocean; large bodies of water are definite. 

খ — (c) 'footsteps': when listening generally we use the plural noun without an article ('listen for footsteps'). (d) 'the boardwalk': this is a specific feature near the cottage, so 'the' is appropriate. 

গ — (e) 'the shutters': the shutters of that cottage are definite (the ones belonging to the cottage). (f) 'a lantern': any single lantern used for light, so 'a' is correct. 

ঘ — (g) 'a fisherman': this introduces a nonspecific person who might be returning; 'a' is indefinite. (h) 'the path': the path to the cottage is a specific route, so 'the' is used.

Sometimes we imagine (f) ______ ghost pacing past (g) ______ window and laugh, then hide (h) ______ notebook under our pillow.

Options:
ক. Fill blanks (a) and (b).
খ. Fill blanks (c) and (d).
গ. Fill blanks (e) and (f).
ঘ. Fill blanks (g) and (h).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) a quiet corridor; (b) a university hostel
খ (c) an old lamp; (d) the corner
গ (e) the electric heater; (f) a ghost
ঘ (g) the window; (h) a notebook

Explanation:
ক — (a) 'a quiet corridor': the corridor is one among many possible corridors, so the indefinite article 'a' is appropriate. (b) 'a university hostel': speaking of one hostel in a general sense, 'a' is used. 

খ — (c) 'an old lamp': 'old' begins with a vowel sound, so 'an' is required. (d) 'the corner': the specific corner where the lamp stands is definite, hence 'the'. 

গ — (e) 'the electric heater': the heater in that room is a specific appliance, so 'the' fits. (f) 'a ghost': an imagined, nonspecific entity — 'a' is correct. 

ঘ — (g) 'the window': the window of that corridor/room is a definite reference. (h) 'a notebook': one unspecified notebook placed under the pillow, so the indefinite 'a' is used.

Question:
Rapid urban migration in Bangladesh has resulted in (a) _____ expansion of informal settlements and (b) _____ pressure on public transport. Although a young workforce represents (c) _____ capacity for economic growth, inadequate (d) _____ education often prevents them from getting skilled employment.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a).
খ. Fill blank (b).
গ. Fill blank (c).
ঘ. Fill blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক unprecedented
খ mounting
গ enormous
ঘ vocational

Explanation:
ক (unprecedented): 'Expansion of informal settlements' due to rapid urban migration is best described as 'unprecedented' when the rate and scale are historically high.

খ (mounting): 'Pressure on public transport' is commonly described as 'mounting' or 'increasing' — 'mounting' emphasizes a growing, accumulating strain.

গ (enormous): A 'young workforce' represents a large and promising potential; 'enormous capacity' captures the significant contribution youth can make to economic growth.

ঘ (vocational): The sentence contrasts potential with a lack of applicable skills; 'vocational education' specifically refers to job-oriented training that would enable youth to obtain skilled employment. 'Vocational' fits the grammar after 'inadequate'.

Question:
Climate variability affects Bangladesh's agriculture through (a) _____ flooding and (b) _____ salinity intrusion in coastal farmlands. To sustain crop output farmers require (c) _____ seed varieties and (d) _____ water-management practices.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a).
খ. Fill blank (b).
গ. Fill blank (c).
ঘ. Fill blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক recurrent
খ increased
গ salt-tolerant
ঘ improved

Explanation:
ক (recurrent): Flooding in Bangladesh is often seasonal and repeats; 'recurrent' captures that periodic nature.

খ (increased): 'Salinity intrusion' in coastal soils has been worsening with sea-level rise and reduced freshwater flow; 'increased' indicates the growing problem.

গ (salt-tolerant): To cope with salinity, farmers need crop varieties that can tolerate saline conditions — 'salt-tolerant' is precise and context-appropriate.

ঘ (improved): 'Water-management practices' should be enhanced (better irrigation scheduling, drainage, rainwater harvesting); 'improved' succinctly conveys the need for upgrading existing methods.

Public health in many rural areas still struggles with (a) _____ child malnutrition and a (b) _____ rate of maternal mortality. Strengthening (c) _____ care networks and expanding (d) _____ awareness can substantially reduce these problems.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a).
খ. Fill blank (b).
গ. Fill blank (c).
ঘ. Fill blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক chronic
খ high
গ primary-health
ঘ maternal-health

Explanation:
ক (chronic): 'Child malnutrition' in rural settings is often long-standing; 'chronic' indicates persistent, systemic malnutrition.

খ (high): 'Rate of maternal mortality' being problematic is best described as 'high' to show severity compared with acceptable benchmarks.

গ (primary-health): Strengthening local, front-line services — 'primary-health care networks' — addresses prevention, early detection, and basic treatment and is the right level to reduce deaths and malnutrition.

ঘ (maternal-health): Expanding 'maternal-health awareness' (prenatal care, danger signs, nutrition, family planning) directly targets causes of maternal mortality and improves outcomes; the phrase fits the context and grammar.

Question:
Public Wi‑Fi hotspots are commonly found in coffee shops, airports, hotels and libraries. They allow devices to access the internet without using a cellular data plan. Hotspots rely on a local wired connection and a wireless access point, and many offer basic protection for users' traffic. Fill the blanks below about how hotspots work and what they require.

Options:
ক. Hotspots provide internet access to __________ users within a limited physical range.
খ. Hotspots normally connect to the internet over a __________ backbone provided by an Internet service provider.
গ. The wireless device that broadcasts the network to users is called an __________ (standards: IEEE 802.11).
ঘ. To encrypt user traffic on an open network, hotspots may implement security protocols such as __________ or __________.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক nearby mobile or portable device users

খ fixed wired broadband backhaul (e.g., DSL, cable or fiber)

গ Wi‑Fi access point (IEEE 802.11 AP)

ঘ WPA2 or WPA3 (Wi‑Fi Protected Access versions)

Explanation:
ক: Hotspots serve devices that are physically close to the access point — typically mobile phones, tablets, and laptops — so describing them as 'nearby mobile or portable device users' captures that limited range.

খ: A hotspot itself is an access layer; it forwards traffic to the wider internet over a fixed wired connection (DSL, cable, or fiber) supplied by a local ISP. Calling this the 'fixed wired broadband backhaul' is accurate.

গ: The device that creates the wireless network is an access point using the Wi‑Fi family of standards (IEEE 802.11). It may be built into a router or be a standalone AP.

ঘ: WPA2 and WPA3 are the current Wi‑Fi security protocols used to encrypt traffic and authenticate users on wireless networks. They are widely implemented to protect against eavesdropping on public hotspots.

Question:
Satellite phones and satellite data terminals provide communication where terrestrial networks are absent. They connect via orbiting satellites and are used in maritime, emergency, and remote-land operations. Complete the statements about satellite connectivity and performance.

Options:
ক. Satellite handsets communicate with __________ located above the Earth rather than with local cell towers.
খ. These systems are particularly valuable for __________ operations such as disaster response, scientific expeditions, and shipping.
গ. They are essential where there is no __________ infrastructure on the ground.
ঘ. One trade-off for wide-area coverage is often greater __________ compared with terrestrial cellular voice/data.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক communication satellites in orbit (GEO, MEO or LEO)

খ emergency, maritime and remote-area operations

গ terrestrial/cellular ground infrastructure

ঘ propagation delay (higher latency)

Explanation:
ক: Satellite phones link to satellites (which may be geostationary, medium-Earth, or low-Earth orbit) rather than to nearby terrestrial cell towers.

খ: Satellite systems are most useful where reliable terrestrial service is unavailable — for disaster relief, ships at sea, polar or desert expeditions, and other remote-area use cases.

গ: In those remote regions, the usual ground-based network elements (cell towers, wired backhaul) are absent or impractical, so satellites provide the missing connectivity.

ঘ: Signals must travel much farther to and from satellites, especially GEO satellites ~36,000 km up, introducing noticeable propagation delay (latency) compared with local cellular links; even LEO systems have some added delay relative to a purely terrestrial connection.

ক mobile operating system (e.g., Android or iOS)

খ app store / application marketplace (e.g., Google Play, Apple App Store)

গ GPS/GNSS receivers (Global Positioning System or other GNSS)

ঘ biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint or face recognition

Explanation:
ক: The mobile operating system (OS) — like Android or iOS — is responsible for managing CPU, memory, peripherals, app lifecycle, and security on smartphones.

খ: App distribution is handled via an app store or marketplace maintained by the platform vendor (for example Google Play on Android or the App Store on iOS), which provides installation, updates, and review controls.

গ: Location-aware features rely on GNSS receivers (commonly GPS) built into the device; these chips receive signals from navigation satellites to calculate position.

ঘ: To secure access, devices increasingly rely on biometrics (fingerprint sensors or front-facing facial-recognition systems) because they provide convenient and strong user authentication tied to the physical user.

Question:
When (a) ——— famous painter Laila agreed to decorate (b) ——— royal hall, the governor promised her (c) ——— gold coin for every (d) ——— tile she painted. After she completed one hundred tiles, the governor paid her in copper coins instead.

Options:

খ. Fill blank (b).
গ. Fill blank (c).
ঘ. Fill blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক the
খ the
গ a
ঘ painted

Explanation:
ক (the): We use the definite article "the" before a noun phrase when the speaker and listener know which person is meant; here Laila is identified as "famous painter Laila," so "the famous painter Laila" is correct. খ (the): "the royal hall" is a specific hall (the hall of the royal residence), so the definite article "the" is needed. গ (a): When promising a single coin per unit, we use the indefinite article "a" ("a gold coin for every ..."). ঘ (painted): The participle "painted" describes which tiles qualify for payment (tiles that she painted). "Painted" fits naturally after "every" to mean "every tile that was painted by her."

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক the
খ an

ঘ completed

Explanation:
ক (the): "the scholar Raza" is appropriate because Raza is identified by name and thus definite. খ (an): "an encyclopedia"—the indefinite article "an" is used before vowel sounds; "encyclopedia" begins with a vowel sound, so "an" is correct. গ (a): "a shilling for each..." uses the indefinite article to indicate one unit of reward per entry. ঘ (completed): "completed entry" specifies entries that Raza finished; the adjective/participle "completed" correctly modifies "entry" in the phrase "each completed entry."

Correct Answer:

Explanation:
ক (the): "the young musician Tara" uses "the" because Tara is a specific individual already identified by name. খ (a): "a cycle of songs" refers to one unspecified cycle, so the indefinite article "a" is correct. গ (a): Again, "a gold coin" indicates one coin per unit; "a" is the correct indefinite article. ঘ (finished): The participle "finished" describes which songs count for payment — songs that she finished. Using "finished" after "every" makes the meaning clear: every song that was completed by her.

Question:
A young painter inherited a tiny studio from her grandmother but lost interest in painting. She read novels instead of working at easels and left most of her supplies untouched. One afternoon she met (a) ___ elderly curator who advised her to take (b) ___ outdoor sketching class and practise every day. Following (c) ___ curator's advice, she cleaned (d) ___ brushes, primed (e) ___ canvases and began to paint. After several months she placed (f) ___ portfolio in (g) ___ local gallery and slowly regained her confidence.

Options:
ক. Fill blanks (a)–(c).
খ. Fill blanks (d)–(e).
গ. Fill blanks (f)–(g).
ঘ. Explain why the chosen articles/determiners are correct in one sentence each.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) an; (b) an; (c) the

খ (d) the; (e) the

গ (f) a; (g) the

ঘ Explanations:
- (a) "elderly" begins with a vowel sound (e-), so use "an elderly curator." 
- (b) "outdoor sketching class" is introduced nonspecifically here, and "outdoor" begins with a vowel sound (o-), so "an" fits the sound pattern; additionally, the curator is recommending one class among many: "an outdoor sketching class." 
- (c) The curator has been mentioned specifically now (the particular curator who advised her), so use "the curator." 
- (d) "the brushes" refers to the painter's own brushes already mentioned as untouched supplies, so the definite article "the." 
- (e) "the canvases" similarly refers to the painter's specific canvases in her studio. 
- (f) "a portfolio" is introduced for the first time and is nonspecific, so use "a." 
- (g) "the local gallery" points to a definite, contextually identified gallery (the one local to her), so use "the."

Explanation:
This passage tests correct use of articles (a/an/the) and definiteness. Use "a/an" for introducing something nonspecific or one among many; choose "an" before vowel sounds. Use "the" when referring back to a specific, previously mentioned, or contextually identifiable noun (e.g., the curator who advised her; the brushes and canvases in her studio; the local gallery known in context).

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) the; (b) the; (c) an

খ (d) a; (e) the

গ (f) some; (g) the

ঘ Explanations:
- (a) "the vacant plot" — the plot is specific in the story (near the river), so "the." 
- (b) "the river" — a particular river referenced by location (near the plot), so definite article "the." 
- (c) "an immediate return" — introducing the idea of any single immediate return (nonspecific), so "an." 
- (d) "a stray dog" — a dog appears for the first time and is nonspecific, so "a." 
- (e) "the young trees" — these are the specific saplings the gardener planted, so "the." 
- (f) "some cold drinks" — plural, indefinite offer; "some" expresses an unspecified quantity of refreshments. 
- (g) "the plants" — refers back to the particular plants in the vacant plot, so the definite article "the."

Explanation:
Use "the" when both speaker and listener can identify the noun (specific plot, river, or the plants already planted). Use "a/an" for first mention of a singular, nonspecific item (a stray dog, an immediate return). Use "some" for an indefinite plural or uncountable quantity offered (some cold drinks).

খ (d) the; (e) a; (f) a

গ (g) a; (h) his

ঘ Explanations:
- (a) "a remote village" — first mention, nonspecific, so "a." 
- (b) "a cup of tea" — an individual cup introduced for the first time, nonspecific: "a." 
- (c) "the host" — now refers to the specific person who invited him (definite), so "the." 
- (d) "the nearby hill" — a particular hill identified by proximity, so "the." 
- (e) "a panorama" — one among many possible views, introduced nonspecifically, so "a." 
- (f) "a small notebook" — a single notebook introduced nonspecifically for sketching, so "a." 
- (g) "a postcard" — one postcard, nonspecific; "a" is used for first mention. 
- (h) "his friend" — the friend is specific and related to the traveler; the possessive "his" makes it definite.

Explanation:
Articles 'a/an' introduce nonspecific, first-mentioned items; 'the' marks contextually specific or previously identified items. Possessives (his) inherently specify the noun (friend) and replace the need for an article.

Context: The internet has changed how we live, learn and work. Fill the blanks in the following sentences using appropriate words (articles, prepositions, adverbs, etc.) to make each sentence grammatically correct and meaningful.

Options:

ঘ responsibly

Explanation:
ক (an): 'important' begins with a vowel sound, so the correct indefinite article before it is 'an'.
খ (the): 'most convenient' is a superlative construction indicating a unique or specific item among all ways, so we use the definite article 'the'.
গ (a): 'single day' is a nonspecific, countable noun phrase; we use the indefinite article 'a'.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a valuable
খ an

Explanation:
ক: 'a valuable' — 'valuable' begins with a consonant sound, so 'a valuable asset' is correct and natural. খ: 'an' — used before 'eminent' because 'eminent' begins with a vowel sound (/ˈɛmɪnənt/); the full phrase is 'an eminent researcher'. গ: 'an inspiring' — 'inspiring' begins with a vowel sound (/ɪ/), so 'an inspiring professor' is correct. ঘ: 'a' — used before 'well-organized routine' because 'well-organized' begins with a consonant sound; 'a well-organized routine' is the natural collocation. Overall, article selection depends on the initial sound of the following word (vowel sound → 'an'; consonant sound → 'a'), and adjective-noun pairs are chosen for natural meaning in the context.

"Though daily newspapers are not always (a) ———— unmixed blessings, they remain (b) ———— one of the most useful things in our lives.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক an
খ one of the
গ a
ঘ a

Explanation:
ক (an): The phrase is "not always an unmixed blessing." "Unmixed blessing" is an idiom in singular form and requires the article "an" before the vowel-initial adjective "unmixed."

খ (one of the): The sentence needs a phrase that indicates newspapers are part of a group of useful things. "One of the" correctly introduces the superlative phrase "one of the most useful things."

গ (a): The idiom "seldom pass a day without ..." uses "a" to mean "any single day." "A day" is the common collocation here, not "the day" or "every day."

ঘ (a): The comparison "like a frog in a well" is the standard simile. The singular article "a" is required before "frog" to make the idiom grammatical.

Question:
The spread of digital reading has changed habits, but many attitudes about books remain. Complete the passage by supplying the missing words.

"With the rise of e-books and online articles, reading has become (a) ———— accessible to a wider audience, yet the tactile pleasure of print is (b) ———— cherished by many bibliophiles. Some readers set aside (c) ———— an hour every evening to read quietly. A life without regular reading can leave one's view of the world (d) ———— narrow."

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক more
খ still
গ about
ঘ rather

Explanation:
ক (more): The comparative "more accessible" correctly contrasts increased accessibility due to e-books with past conditions.

খ (still): "Still cherished" conveys that despite technological change, printed books continue to be valued; "still" is the appropriate adverb here.

গ (about): "Set aside about an hour" is the natural collocation to indicate an approximate duration; "about" fits better than "a" or "the."

ঘ (rather): The adverb "rather" modifies "narrow" to indicate the degree of narrowness resulting from not reading. Alternatives like "too" could work in other contexts, but "rather narrow" is idiomatic here.

Question:
Compare quick social updates with edited journalism in the passage below and fill the blanks.

"Social platforms often deliver breaking news (a) ———— instantly, but they frequently lack the (b) ———— depth and verification that newspapers provide. Good editors make sure articles are (c) ———— checked for facts before publishing. Without such care, readers can become (d) ———— misinformed."

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক almost
খ the
গ thoroughly
ঘ easily

Explanation:
ক (almost): "Almost instantly" is a common phrase to indicate something happens very quickly but perhaps not literally the instant it occurs. Other options like "very" could work, but "almost" neatly conveys near-instant delivery.

খ (the): The phrase "the depth and verification" refers to a specific kind of depth expected from newspapers; the definite article "the" is appropriate when referring to that established quality.

গ (thoroughly): "Thoroughly checked for facts" is the standard collocation meaning rigorously examined. Other adverbs like "carefully" would also fit, but "thoroughly" emphasizes completeness.

ঘ (easily): "Easily misinformed" means it is simple for readers to become misled without proper verification. "Easily" is the idiomatic choice to convey susceptibility.

Question:
Samira is (a) ——— bright student who always helps others. She believes that reading regularly is (b) ——— good habit. One day she might become (c) ——— accomplished lawyer or (d) ——— inspiring teacher.

Options:
ক. Fill in blank (a).
খ. Fill in blank (b).
গ. Fill in blank (c).
ঘ. Fill in blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a
খ a
গ an
ঘ an

Explanation:
ক (a): Use "a" before words beginning with a consonant sound. "Bright" begins with a consonant sound /b/, so "a bright student" is correct.

খ (b): "Good" begins with a consonant sound /g/, therefore "a good habit" is correct (we use the indefinite article for a nonspecific singular noun).

গ (c): "Accomplished" begins with a vowel sound /ə/ (schwa), so the correct article is "an": "an accomplished lawyer." The rule is to choose a/an based on pronunciation (vowel vs consonant sound), not spelling alone.

ঘ (d): "Inspiring" begins with a vowel sound /ɪ/, so "an inspiring teacher" is correct. Even though "teacher" starts with a consonant, the article depends on the word immediately following it (here, "inspiring").

Question:
Rafiq follows a disciplined routine. (a) ——— practice of studying for an hour each evening helped him improve. He hopes to be (b) ——— artist and perhaps later (c) ——— engineer. He treats every day as (d) ——— new opportunity to learn.

Options:
ক. Fill in blank (a).
খ. Fill in blank (b).
গ. Fill in blank (c).
ঘ. Fill in blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The
খ an
গ an
ঘ a

Explanation:
ক (a): "The practice of studying..." is natural here because we refer to a specific routine already mentioned (the habit described), so the definite article "the" is appropriate.

খ (b): "Artist" can begin with a vowel sound if modified or in isolation it is pronounced with a vowel consonant? The correct form is "an artist" because "artist" begins with the vowel sound /ɑː/.

গ (c): "Engineer" begins with the vowel sound /ɛ/ (or /ɪ/ in some accents), so we use "an engineer." Use "an" before words starting with vowel sounds.

ঘ (d): "A new opportunity" is the correct choice because we refer to one nonspecific instance among many; "new" begins with a consonant sound /n/, so "a" is used.

Question:
Leila understands that youth is (a) ——— crucial phase for building habits. She has set (b) ——— definite target to finish her degree. To pursue it she follows (c) ——— organized study-plan and values (d) ——— honest effort above all.

Options:
ক. Fill in blank (a).
খ. Fill in blank (b).
গ. Fill in blank (c).
ঘ. Fill in blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a
খ a
গ an
ঘ an

Explanation:
ক (a): Use "a" before "crucial" because it begins with a consonant sound /k/, so "a crucial phase" is correct.

খ (b): "A definite target" — "definite" begins with a consonant sound /d/, and the noun is nonspecific here, so "a" is appropriate.

গ (c): "An organized study-plan" — "organized" begins with a vowel sound /ɔː/ or /o/, depending on accent, but it is treated as starting with a vowel sound, so "an" is used for euphony and correct pronunciation.

ঘ (d): "An honest effort" — although "honest" starts with the letter 'h', the 'h' is silent and the word begins with a vowel sound /ɒ/ or /ɑː/; therefore the correct article is "an." This illustrates that article choice depends on sound, not spelling.

Question:
Modern mobile devices do much more than make voice calls. A typical smartphone offers telephony, messaging, and internet services to (a) —— users moving across coverage areas. When a device leaves one coverage area and enters another, the connection is handed over between (b) —— that serve each cell. These radio access nodes forward calls and packets to an operator's (c) —— which provides switching, billing and interconnection to the public telephone network and the internet. Advances in radio and core design increased the available (d) ——, enabling services such as HD voice, video streaming and real‑time cloud apps.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a) — what kind of users?
খ. Fill blank (b) — name the radio nodes that cover cells.
গ. Fill blank (c) — what part of the operator's infrastructure handles switching and interconnection?
ঘ. Fill blank (d) — what was increased to enable streaming and real‑time apps?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক mobile users
খ base stations (cell towers / base transceiver stations)
গ core network (mobile core / IMS / EPC depending on generation)
ঘ data rates (bandwidth / throughput)

Explanation:
ক — "mobile users" is the standard term for people using wireless devices while moving between coverage areas. খ — The radio nodes that provide coverage for each cell are commonly called base stations; terms include cell towers or base transceiver stations (BTS). These perform the air interface functions and manage radio resources. গ — The operator's core network (for example, the EPC in LTE or the IMS for multimedia services) performs switching, subscriber management, billing, and interconnection with the PSTN and the internet. ঘ — To support services like HD voice and video streaming the networks increased available data rates (more bandwidth and higher throughput), achieved through better radio technologies, spectrum, and core capacity.

Question:
Consider portable wireless handsets used for personal and business communication. Unlike a desk phone that requires a physical phone jack, a handset registers using a subscriber identity stored on a (a) —— which authenticates the user to the operator. Calls and data are carried over the radio link to the nearest (b) —— and then through signaling and routing in the operator's backbone. Newer mobile services also support IP‑based voice (VoIP) over mobile — commonly called (c) —— — and features like mobile payments and push e‑mail rely on (d) —— for secure transactions.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a) — what stores subscriber identity?
খ. Fill blank (b) — name the immediate radio access node.
গ. Fill blank (c) — what is IP‑based voice over mobile networks called?
ঘ. Fill blank (d) — what is required to make mobile payments and push e‑mail secure?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক SIM (Subscriber Identity Module)
খ base station (cell site)
গ VoLTE (Voice over LTE) or more generally VoIP over mobile
ঘ end‑to‑end security (encryption / secure authentication such as TLS / SIM‑based authentication)

Explanation:
ক — The SIM card holds the subscriber identity (IMSI and authentication keys) and enables the handset to register with the mobile network. Modern eSIMs perform the same function in embedded form. খ — The base station (also called cell site or eNodeB in LTE terminology) is the radio access point that connects the handset to the operator network. গ — IP‑based voice over mobile networks is commonly referred to as VoLTE in LTE networks; more broadly it is VoIP on mobile. VoLTE uses the IMS architecture for call control. ঘ — Secure mobile services require encryption and strong authentication. Techniques include SIM‑based authentication, TLS/HTTPS for apps, and payment‑specific protections (tokenization, secure elements) to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

Question:
In areas without terrestrial cell coverage, specialized devices provide voice and data via satellites. Satellite phones connect to a (a) —— in orbit instead of a nearby cell tower. Compared with terrestrial cellular links, satellite links typically exhibit higher (b) —— which can affect interactive services. Their usable (c) —— is often lower than urban mobile networks, limiting high‑speed streaming, but they offer critical connectivity for (d) —— such as remote field teams and disaster response.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a) — what do satellite phones connect to?
খ. Fill blank (b) — what characteristic is higher on satellite links?
গ. Fill blank (c) — what resource is usually lower than in urban mobile networks?
ঘ. Fill blank (d) — name the groups that particularly benefit from satellite connectivity.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক satellite (satellite constellation / geostationary or LEO satellite)
খ latency (propagation delay)
গ bandwidth (data throughput)
ঘ emergency responders, remote workers, maritime and aeronautical users

Explanation:
ক — Satellite phones link to satellites (either a single geostationary satellite or a low‑earth‑orbit constellation) rather than terrestrial base stations. খ — Because of the long distances (especially to geostationary orbit), satellite communications generally have higher latency (longer propagation delay), which impacts real‑time interactivity like gaming or some VoIP scenarios. ল — Satellite systems often provide lower usable bandwidth compared with dense urban cellular networks, limiting sustained high‑speed streaming or large downloads. ঘ — Satellite connectivity is vital for emergency responders, remote field teams, ships, and aircraft where terrestrial networks are unavailable; it provides continuity of communication in disasters and remote operations.

Question:
My father is (a) — honest and (b) — devoted family man. He works (c) — a factory and comes home (d) — the evening to spend time with us.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক an
খ a
গ in a factory
ঘ in the evening

Explanation:
ক (an): 'honest' begins with a vowel sound /ˈɒnəst/, so we use the indefinite article 'an'.
খ (a): 'devoted' begins with a consonant sound, so the correct indefinite article is 'a' — 'a devoted family man'.
গ (in a factory): For workplaces like 'factory' we commonly use the preposition 'in' to indicate being inside that place: 'works in a factory'. 'At a factory' is also possible but 'in a factory' emphasizes working inside the building.
ঘ (in the evening): The habitual time expression uses 'in the evening' to indicate a part of the day when he comes home.

Question:
Our school has (a) — responsible headmistress. She treats students (b) — fairness and insists on (c) — highest standards. Students attend assemblies (d) — every morning.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a
খ with
গ the
ঘ every

Explanation:
ক (a): 'responsible' begins with a consonant sound; use the indefinite article 'a' before a singular count noun: 'a responsible headmistress'.
খ (with): The phrase 'treats students with fairness' uses the preposition 'with' to link the verb 'treats' and the noun 'fairness'. Alternatively, one could say 'treats students fairly' (an adverb), but the blank as given suits 'with'.
গ (the): 'highest standards' refers to specific, highest level expectations, so the definite article 'the' is used: 'insists on the highest standards'.
ঘ (every): Time frequency 'every morning' does not take an article; the correct word is 'every' to indicate each morning.

Question:
There is (a) — old banyan tree in the courtyard. Birds build nests (b) — its branches. Children play (c) — shade and read books (d) — afternoons.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a)
খ. Fill blank (b)
গ. Fill blank (c)
ঘ. Fill blank (d)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক an
খ on
গ in the shade
ঘ in the afternoons

Explanation:
ক (an): 'old' starts with a vowel sound, so use 'an' — 'an old banyan tree'.
খ (on): Birds build nests 'on its branches' because nests are placed on the surface of branches; the preposition 'on' denotes that location.
গ (in the shade): 'Play in the shade' is the idiomatic phrase using the preposition 'in' plus the definite article 'the' for a specific area of shade provided by the tree.
ঘ (in the afternoons): To indicate habitual activity during that part of the day, use 'in the afternoons' (or 'in the afternoon' for a general statement); 'in the afternoons' emphasizes repeated events across afternoons.

Question:
After you conduct a quick baseline check of student performance, you must decide which topics and activities to include in your next unit. Those decisions should reflect learners' current status as well as the goals you set. Many teachers treat content selection and assessment planning as separate tasks, yet they are closely linked and should inform one another throughout the instructional cycle.

Options:
ক. Choose the best word to complete: After you conduct (a) __________ baseline check of student performance...
খ. Choose the best word to complete: ...decide which topics and activities to include in (b) __________ next unit.
গ. Choose the best word to complete: Many teachers treat content selection and assessment planning as (c) __________ tasks...
ঘ. Choose the best word to complete: ...yet they are closely linked and should (d) __________ one another throughout the instructional cycle.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক a
খ the
গ separate
ঘ inform

Explanation:
ক (a → a): The phrase 'a baseline check' introduces one instance of a screening activity; the indefinite article 'a' is appropriate because this is not specifying a previously mentioned unique baseline check. খ (b → the): 'the next unit' refers to a definite, specific unit that follows in the course sequence; 'the' identifies that particular upcoming unit. গ (c → separate): Grammatically and semantically, 'separate tasks' correctly conveys that teachers often treat these activities as distinct from each other. ঘ (d → inform): 'Inform one another' expresses the reciprocal relationship between content selection and assessment planning—each should provide input to the other. Pedagogically, this highlights alignment: assessments should reflect content and objectives, and content should be chosen with assessment and learning goals in mind.
