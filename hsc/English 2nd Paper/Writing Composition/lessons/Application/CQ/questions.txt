Question:
Write a paragraph on "The causes and effects of failure in English" within 200 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Causes of Failure in English and their Remedies

There are several causes of failure in English education in Bangladesh. Some specific causes and potential remedies are discussed here. Many schools in Bangladesh lack the resources, such as textbooks and other teaching materials, necessary to provide effective English language instruction. Providing schools with the resources they need to teach English effectively, such as textbooks and other materials, could help improve students' proficiency in the language. Many English teachers in Bangladesh have not received the training necessary to effectively teach the language. Providing teachers with training in teaching methods and curriculum development could help improve their ability to teach English effectively. English is often seen as a foreign language in Bangladesh, which the students do not use in their daily lives. Creating more opportunities for students to use English in real-life situations, such as through conversation clubs or exchange programs, could help them become more proficient in the language. Incorporating English language instruction into other subjects, such as science and math, and emphasizing the practical benefits of being proficient in English, such as higher education and job opportunities, could help increase students' motivation to learn the language. Students from lower socio-economic backgrounds may not have the same level of access to resources and opportunities to improve their proficiency in English, which can also contribute to failure in English education.

Explanation:
Failure in English often stems from a mix of personal and contextual causes: weak foundational skills in grammar and vocabulary, irregular practice, poor study habits, low motivation, fear of making mistakes, and inadequate or mismatched teaching methods. External factors such as lack of exposure to English, limited reading and speaking opportunities, time constraints, and stress or family pressures also contribute. The effects of failure include reduced confidence, poorer academic results, limited communication skills, and fewer educational or career opportunities; it can create a cycle where avoidance of English practice worsens ability and motivation. Corrective steps—consistent practice, targeted grammar and vocabulary work, speaking and listening practice, effective study strategies, supportive feedback, and quality instruction—can break this cycle and restore progress.

Explanation: This paragraph is correct because it links specific causes (skill gaps, habits, environment) to predictable effects (confidence loss, limited opportunities) and offers targeted remedies; understanding that failure is multifactorial helps students focus on practical changes—regular practice, better strategies, and supportive learning—to improve English.

Question:
Write a cause and effect paragraph on "Environment Polution" Your paragraph should not exceed 200 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Environment Pollution

The environment refers to the air, water and land in which people, animals and plants live. Human beings, animals, plants, air, water and soil are the main elements of the environment. These elements should be pollution-free for our healthy living. But when they are polluted and their essential balance is disrupted, it is called environmental pollution. Nowadays, almost everywhere, our environment is getting polluted. In many places of our country, the environment has become extremely polluted. We, ourselves, are responsible for this situation. Industries and factories emit huge amount of smoke, gases and fume. Motor vehicles also emit large amount of smoke and gases. All these cause air pollution. Water is polluted from the dumping of industrial wastes and by chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Due to the indiscriminate use of vehicle horns, loud speakers, microphones, etc., sound is polluted. Soil is polluted by harmful chemical fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides. Trees play an important role In the environment. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Thus, they save the environment. But trees are being cut down for different commercial purposes. This needs to be stopped for the sake of keeping our environment healthy. Environment pollution is a great threat to our existence. It changes the world's climate and brings about different kinds of natural disasters. Thus, the world is getting unsuitable for living. To make life healthy and comfortable, we should keep the environment clean and pollution free.

Explanation:
Environmental pollution is caused by human activities such as industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, deforestation, and improper waste disposal. These actions release harmful chemicals and particulates into air, water, and soil, causing respiratory illnesses, loss of biodiversity, contaminated water supplies, and climate change. This paragraph is correct because it clearly links specific causes to observable effects, showing the causal relationship needed to understand how reducing those activities can prevent or lessen the damage.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Road Accidents in Bangladesh/ Causes and Effects of Road Accidents in Bangladesh

Road accident is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh. It occurs for some specific reasons. Reckless driving contributes to most of the accidents. The drivers maneuver their motorised vehicles at breakneck speed. Sometimes they lose their control over steering that leads to accidents. Violation of traffic rules also accounts for road accidents. Inadequate traffic rules and inefficient traffic policemen are sometimes responsible for road accidents. Narrow roads create hindrances to the smooth movement of vehicles that cause accidents. Overloaded transports are also the cause of accidents. Mechanical failures, including faulty brakes and bald tyres also contribute to fatal accidents. A road accident is considered as a curse. It causes enormous losses including major and minor injuries, psychological trauma, disability and even death to the victims. It also causes material losses including waste of money for treatment of the victims and repairing the vehicles. Undoubtedly, the effects of road accident leave a haunting memory on the individuals and their family. In the long run, a road accident affects the country's national economy. So, the government must enforce a strict law for transportation sector and take stern steps to check accidents that claim thousands of lives per year.

Question:
Write a paragraph on "Global Warming" in 200 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Global Warming

Global warming is the ultimate result of environmental pollution. Air, one of the most important elements of environment, is getting polluted. As a result, the air surrounding the earth is gradually getting warmer. This is called global warming. It is negatively affecting the environment. Because of global warming, nature gets affected. As a result, natural calamities hit us every now and then. The lower southern part of Bangladesh will go under water owing to, global warming. The destruction and burning down of tropical rain forests, the traffic clogging up city streets, the rapid growth of industries, the use of chlorofluorocarbons in packaging and manufacturing commercial products, the use of detergents etc. are some major causes of global warming. So, the main elements responsible for global warming are carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons and so on. We can prevent it from getting worse by stopping or lessening environmental pollution. Moreover, we can arrange different seminars nationally and internationally for mass awareness. Different media can play their parts in this regard. To lead a healthy and happier life, we cannot but control global warming.

Question:
Write a cause-and-effect paragraph on "Price hike " , briefly describing the causes and its impacts on our daily life.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Causes of Price Hike and Its Effects

Bangladesh is a small country with several problems. Among the recent problems, price hike is widely discussed. Price hike means the rise of price of daily necessaries. The price of essential commodities is increasing by leaps and bounds. Today, price hike is a common phenomenon in our economy. It has spread its evil clutch all over the country. Prices of daily essentials are increasing alarmingly. People of fixed and limited income are suffering a lot. All are getting worried about this problem. There are many causes behind price hike. The first and foremost cause is over population. Man-made crisis of commodities. is another cause. Dishonest businessmen do it for higher profits. Business syndicate, smuggling and corruption are also key causes of price hike. It also depends on international market. Besides, anarchy and unawareness are responsible for it. The effects of price hike are many. Most of the people of Bangladesh are living below poverty line. So, their condition is becoming miserable. Many "of them have to remain famished almost every day. The poor children are leaving school in despair. For price hike, the poor are becoming poorer. The problem of price hike is hindering the overall development of our country. We have to take some immediate steps to bring down prices of valuable commodities. At first, food production must be increased as much as possible. Also, dishonest businessmen must be punished. Storing commodities by a profit monger syndicate must be checked to keep price under control, we need political stability as well. The government should store food to cope with any natural disaster. The government should also sell essential commodities for the poor at a lower rate. Smuggling and black marketing are to be eradicated at any cost. Moreover, adequate supply of essential commodities has to be ensured. Above all, conscious people should work together to control price hike.

Explanation:
Price hikes occur when factors like rising production or transportation costs, reduced supply (due to natural disasters or supply-chain disruptions), increased demand, or expansionary government policies push prices up. These changes reduce people’s purchasing power, force households to cut nonessential spending or switch to cheaper goods, and can increase stress and food insecurity in daily life. This explanation is correct because higher costs or lower supply directly raise market prices, which effectively lowers real income and causes the observable changes in consumers’ behavior.

Question:
Write a compare and contrast paragraph on "City life and Rural life" within 200 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Village Life and City Life/ Country Life and City Life/City Life and Rural Life

Since the creation of the universe, man has started living in groups, which finally formed family or society. And with the development of civilisation, man created cities. Now, man is living both in cities and villages. Cities have flourished but the importance of country life has not decreased. In this modern competitive world, needs for city life have increased as most of the modern facilities are still confined to the cities. The development of the society depends both on the development of the cities and villages. If the cities produce something, the villages supply them with the raw materials. In the cities, life is very busy and competitive and people live in polluted environment. On the other hand, in the villages, environment is very fresh and hygienic. Modern facilities are available in the cities whereas most of the villages are bereft of modern facilities. Still, for good medical facilities and higher degrees, people need to go to the cities. In the cities, people lead a very artificial life in big buildings. But in the villages, one can lead a simple life in the lap of nature though nowadays, village politics has come out to be very alarming. Despite some merits and demerits, both lives have their charms, which depend on the individual interests. A balanced development can remove the gaps between two types of life largely.

Explanation:
A correct compare-and-contrast paragraph on "City life and Rural life" clearly identifies the main similarities and differences—such as population density, employment opportunities, access to services, pace of life, and environmental quality—and notes the advantages and drawbacks of each. It works because it begins with a clear topic sentence, groups related points, uses transition words (e.g., "in contrast," "similarly"), gives brief examples, and ends with a summarizing sentence that ties the comparison together. This structure helps students see both factual contrasts and the reasoning behind them, and teaches how to present balanced, organized comparisons.

Question:
Write a paragraph on "The Benefits of Early Rising" in about 200 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Benefits of Early Rising

Early rising provides a person with physical, mental and economic benefits. First of all, a person who wakes up early in the morning takes some exercises or walk in fresh air by the riverside or in the open field. As a result, his physical health is improved in a great way. Secondly, the atmosphere in the early morning remains quiet and calm. No hue and cry is heard then. Nature assumes its best look in the morning with colourful flowers and green leaves. Birds begin to chirp. All these make our mind fresh and lively. Thirdly, an early riser also gets enough time to do his/her work properly. Thus, he can earn better and lead a more enjoyable life. In other words, an early riser can avail himself of more economic benefits. On the contrary, if one gets up late, the schedule of his work becomes interrupted. To sum up, early rising makes a man healthy, wealthy, and cheerful.

Explanation:
Waking up early brings several clear benefits that improve daily life and long-term well-being. Early risers often enjoy quieter, uninterrupted hours that make planning and focused work easier, which boosts productivity and helps complete important tasks before distractions begin. Morning light helps regulate the body’s circadian rhythm, improving sleep quality and mood, while giving time for exercise and a healthy breakfast supports physical health and sustained energy. Rising early also encourages better time management and self-discipline, which can reduce stress by preventing last-minute rushes and allowing for thoughtful decision-making. For students and professionals alike, consistent early starts create a routine that enhances concentration, memory, and academic or work performance. Social and mental benefits include a calmer mindset, more time for reflection or reading, and the ability to enjoy peaceful moments that foster creativity. Over time, these habits contribute to greater consistency in daily life, improved overall health, and a stronger sense of control and accomplishment. In short, early rising offers practical advantages—more productive hours, healthier routines, and better sleep patterns—that together support both immediate effectiveness and long-term personal growth.

Question:
Write a paragraph on "Uses and Abuses of Mobile Phone" in about 200 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Uses and Abuses of Mobile Phone

We live in the age of science and technology. Mobile phone is one of the wonderful inventions of modern science and technology. Mobile phone is a scientific device by which we can communicate with others. This communication system is operated without any wire. We cannot imagine a day without mobile phone. Nowadays, especially the students are very prone to absorb the demerits of mobile phone. They sometimes keep chatting and wasting their time with their friends when they are supposed to be at their desk to study. Though people are getting benefits, mobile phone sometimes becomes the cause of health hazards. It causes brain tumours, genetic damage and many other health issues. But it is a matter of great regret that most people are not aware of the disadvantages of mobile phone. The blood pressure becomes high and red blood cells get damaged if a person is continuously exposed to radiation caused by cellular phone. Using cellular phone is also harmful for the pregnant women. So, the government should raise public awareness on using mobile phone by children and pregnant women. If mobile phone is used in a controlled way, it will do more benefit to us.

Explanation:
Mobile phones have become indispensable tools in modern life, offering quick communication, access to information, and many conveniences that improve productivity and safety. They enable instant calls and messages, video calls, email, online banking, navigation, and access to educational resources and news. Smartphones support businesses through remote work, digital payments, and marketing, and they provide entertainment via music, videos, and games. However, excessive or improper use brings serious problems: addiction and screen dependency can harm mental health; distraction while driving or studying leads to accidents and poor performance; constant connectivity may invade privacy and enable cyberbullying, fraud, and the spread of misinformation. Prolonged exposure to screens and poor posture may cause sleep disturbance, eye strain, and physical discomfort. To maximize benefits and minimize harms, users should set time limits, use privacy settings, avoid phone use while driving, verify information sources, and model mindful habits for children. Responsible use, combined with public awareness and sensible regulations, ensures that mobile phones remain powerful tools for progress rather than sources of harm.

This paragraph is correct because it balances both positive uses and common abuses, gives concrete examples of each, and ends with practical measures to reduce harm; that structure helps students understand the concept by showing benefits, risks, and realistic solutions.

Write a paragraph on "International Mother Language Day" in about 200 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
International Mother Language Day

The 21st February is a red letter day in the history of our country. It is our Shaheed Dibash. Now, the day is observed internationally as the International Mother Language Day. In 1948, the then Pakistani rulers declared that only Urdu would be the state language of Pakistan. But our students protested that unjust decision. They claimed Bangla to be one of the state languages. On the 21st February in 1952, students along with the general people brought out a procession. Police fired into the procession and some students died on the spot and many were injured. At last, the Pakistani rulers declared Bangla to be one of the state languages of Pakistan. Many years later, on November 17, 1999 UNESCO declared the day as the International Mother Language Day. At present, the day is observed throughout the world. In Bangladesh, we observe the day with great importance to show respect to our language martyrs as well as to our mother tongue. On the day, people generally wake up early in the morning. They put on black badges and walk to Shaheed Minar barefooted singing the mourning song of the day. They offer flowers and wreaths at the foot of the Shaheed Minar. Meetings, seminars and cultural and religious programmes are arranged across the country. People visit the graveyards of the language martyrs and pray for the salvation of their departed souls.

Write a paragraph on "Tree Plantation" in about 200 words

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Tree Plantation

Tree plantation refers to planting trees at a large scale in a planned way. Trees are our friends. They give us food and shelter as well as soothe our eyes with their green colour. They provide us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They also give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. They supply us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause 'sufficient rainfall and prevent drought. Trees along the roadside and, coastal areas prevent soil erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate people cut down trees at random for their selfish interest. So, we lose trees. Hence, tree plantation programme must be carried out across the country regularly. The more we plant trees, the more our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is crucial as we do not have adequate forest areas required to maintain the ecological balance. Making people conscious of it by holding various seminars and meetings, tree plantation campaign may create positive impact among the people. The mass media like TV and radio can play great roles to inspire people for tree plantation. To make life and environment healthy, there is no alternative to tree plantation.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Padma Multipurpose Bridge/The Padma Bridge

The Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a multipurpose road-rail bridge across the Padma River. Bangladesh has constructed the bridge with its own resources. It connects Louhajong, Munshiganj to Shariatpur and Madaripur. Thus, it links the south-west of the country to northern and eastern regions. Actually, it has connected 21 southern districts with the capital. The bridge is a two-level steel truss bridge that carries a four-lane highway on the upper level and a single-track railway on the lower level. Having 41 spans, each 150 m long and 204 steel piles and 32 vertical bored concrete piles, the bridge is 6.15 km long and 18.18m wide. The rail viaduct has 14 spans of 332 m connecting Mawa end to. Jajira end. Apart from transportation, there are other utilities like gas transmission line, optical fiber and telephone line and high voltage electric line through the bridge. The bridge has been constructed by China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Company Limited. The project has taken 1062 hectares of land. Starting on 7. December 2014, the construction ended in June 2022. This dream bridge was inaugurated on June 25, 2022 and was opened for vehicles the following day. The Padma Bridge is the most expensive project in the history of Bangladesh. However, the bridge will contribute a lot to the economic development of Bangladesh. It will increase the GDP by as much as 1.2 percent. Thus, the Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a significant milestone in the construction history of Bangladesh.

Explanation:
The Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a landmark road-rail bridge across the Padma River in Bangladesh that links the country’s southwestern region more directly with Dhaka and the rest of the nation. At about 6.15 kilometres long, the bridge carries a four-lane highway with provision for a railway line and utility corridors, enabling faster, safer transport of people and goods. Fully financed and built by Bangladesh, it was inaugurated in June 2022 and is celebrated as a symbol of national self-reliance. The bridge’s practical benefits include sharply reduced travel time and transport costs, better market access for agricultural and industrial products, increased investment and job opportunities in the southwest, and easier access to health, education and administrative services. These outcomes together promote balanced regional development and national economic growth. This paragraph is correct because it summarizes widely reported, verifiable facts about the bridge’s dimensions, functions, funding and inauguration, and it states the documented economic and social effects observed and projected since the bridge opened.

Question:
Write a paragraph on "Importances of Moral Values" in about 200 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Importance of Moral Values

Moral values are the principles and ethics that help human beings live a decent life. By following moral values, we live a life of virtue. They also help us live a life of righteousness and virtue. We feel glad when we are moral because we do not fear punishment and retribution for doing immoral acts. If we have moral values in us, we can also inspire others to lead a life of righteousness and virtue. The two major moral values are honesty and truthfulness. When we are honest and truthful, we can have a society free from corruption and violence. Consequently, peace will dominate in that society. Again, to respect other people, their views and opinions are also a type of moral value. If we want to live in peace, we must value others' choices and opinions. Opinions and views may differ but we cannot engage ourselves in fight and quarrel regarding this. We should also do our duties that we have for our parents, family members, teachers and the people of the soceity. More importantly, we have to love our country. We should not do anything that degrades or harms the honour of our country. In order to be an asset to the society as well as the country, we must realize the importance of moral values and sustain it in us.

Question:

d. List and explain three concrete, practical measures the college should implement immediately to prevent outsider disturbance and enhance student safety.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Application to the Principal:

18 August 2025

The Principal
Kamalabad College
Sylhet

Subject: Request to take immediate measures against unauthorized outsiders entering the college campus

Dear Sir/Madam,

We, the students of Kamalabad College, respectfully draw your attention to a persistent problem affecting our academic environment. For the past few weeks strangers — including street vendors, idle youths and a few troublemakers — have been entering the campus during class hours. They often sell goods without permission, play loud music, gather in front of classrooms and, on some occasions, have harassed female students and threatened others. These activities disturb classes and create an unsafe atmosphere for study.

In view of the above, we humbly request that you kindly take the following measures at the earliest: (1) restrict and monitor entry points; (2) appoint or assign a trained guard at the main gate; (3) display clear entry rules and ask unauthorized vendors to stay outside; and (4) coordinate with the local police for periodic patrols. Immediate action will restore a peaceful academic environment and ensure students’ safety.

We shall be grateful for your prompt intervention.

Yours faithfully,

Amina Rahman
Class: XII, Section B, Roll: 07
On behalf of the students of Kamalabad College, Sylhet

b Notice for the college gate (short):

ATTENTION

For the safety and peaceful study environment of our students, NO OUTSIDERS, VENDORS OR UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS are allowed inside the college premises during class hours (8:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m.).

- Gate entry only with valid college ID or visitor pass issued by office.
- Loud music, hawking and loitering are prohibited.
- Anyone violating these rules will be asked to leave and may be handed over to local authorities.

By order of the Principal
Kamalabad College

c Complaint letter to the Officer-in-Charge (O.C.), nearest police station:

18 August 2025

Officer-in-Charge
Sylhet Model Police Station
Sylhet

Subject: Request for police assistance to prevent harassment and unauthorized gatherings on college campus

Sir,

We are students of Kamalabad College, Sylhet. Over the last month there have been recurring incidents of unauthorized outsiders entering our campus during class hours. These persons sell goods without permission, play loud music and on several occasions have verbally harassed and threatened students (female students were teased on 10 August and 12 August at around 11:30 a.m.). Our college has limited security personnel and cannot control the situation alone.

We request that the police kindly increase patrols near the college during class hours and, if possible, station an officer periodically at the gate during busy times. We are willing to provide witness statements and a list of incidents if required. Prompt police support will help prevent escalation and ensure the safety of students.

We hope for your cooperation and prompt action.

Yours faithfully,

Amina Rahman

d Three practical measures the college should implement immediately (with explanation):

1) Controlled entry with ID/visitor pass and trained gatekeeper
   - Require all students and staff to show college ID at entry and issue visitor passes to all guests. Station at least one trained guard at the main gate to check IDs and prevent vendors/strangers from entering. This is the simplest immediate deterrent and directly reduces unauthorized access.

2) Visible signage, regular announcements and a clear disciplinary policy
   - Put up prominent notices at entrances (see sample notice above) and make periodic announcements reminding people of entry rules and penalties. Adopt and publicly share a disciplinary rule that vendors, loiterers and anyone causing disturbance will be removed and may face penalties. Clear rules reduce ambiguity and make enforcement easier.

3) CCTV, lighting and coordination with local police for patrols
   - Install CCTV cameras at the main gate and common areas to monitor activity and deter wrongdoing. Ensure adequate lighting in evening hours. Formally request the local police for regular patrols during peak times and ask for a quick-response plan for reported incidents. Surveillance plus police support improves safety and accountability.

Optional quick actions: organize a short awareness session for students on personal safety and reporting procedures; create a student help desk or hotline; restrict vehicular parking outside the main gate to reduce gathering spots.

These measures are practical, cost-effective and can be implemented quickly to restore a secure learning environment.

Explanation:
This solution package was prepared to provide immediate, usable documents and practical steps. Explanation of choices:

- Application to the Principal: Formal applications require date, recipient, a clear subject line, a concise description of the problem, specific incidents or effects, requested actions and a courteous closing with the applicant’s details. This structure ensures the Principal understands the problem and proposed remedies.

- Gate notice: Notices must be short, direct and placed where everyone can see them. They state prohibited behaviors, required identification procedures and consequences. Clear, simple language increases compliance.

- Police complaint: When harassment or threats occur, informing the local police with dates, approximate times and the nature of incidents is important. A polite, factual tone with an offer to provide witness statements helps obtain cooperation.

- Suggested measures: The three recommended steps (controlled entry, signage/discipline, and CCTV/police coordination) combine low-cost immediate actions with slightly longer-term investments. Controlled entry addresses the root cause (unauthorized access); signage clarifies rules and legitimizes enforcement; surveillance and police coordination enhance deterrence and response capacity.

Tone and format: All documents use polite, formal language and specific requests. Including contact information and offering cooperation (witnesses, student representatives) makes authorities more likely to act. The measures balance immediacy and sustainability so the college can restore a safe, undisturbed academic environment quickly and maintain it over time.

Question:
Write a paragraph on "The Bangabandhu Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge / Bangabandhu Bridge" in about 200 words

Options:
a. Write a coherent paragraph (about 200 words) describing the Bangabandhu Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge: its purpose, general features, and national significance.
b. List five key features of the bridge and give a one-sentence explanation for each feature.
c. Give a brief construction timeline (planning, start, completion, inauguration) and name the types of organizations involved (no need for exact company names).
d. In about 50 words, explain three major economic or social impacts the bridge has had on Bangladesh.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a The Bangabandhu Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge, commonly called the Bangabandhu Bridge, spans the Jamuna (Brahmaputra) River and stands as one of Bangladesh's landmark infrastructure achievements. Built to link the country's eastern and western regions, the bridge transformed transport by carrying road and rail connections across a previously wide and seasonally volatile river channel. Besides facilitating faster movement of people and goods, it hosts utility lines such as power and communication conduits, making it a backbone for regional development. Its construction shortened travel times, integrated markets, and opened up agricultural and industrial opportunities for districts that had been relatively isolated. Strategically important for national cohesion, the bridge also serves as an essential route for trade to neighboring countries and for disaster response logistics within Bangladesh. Named in honor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the structure symbolizes modern nation-building and continues to stimulate investment, tourism, and socio-economic mobility across the country.

b 1) Road and rail connectivity — Provides an all-weather roadway and railway link, uniting east and west Bangladesh and enabling multimodal transport.
2) Multipurpose utilities corridor — Carries power lines, fiber-optic cables, and pipelines, integrating infrastructure services across the river.
3) All-season resilience — Designed to withstand river dynamics and seasonal flooding, ensuring year-round transportation.
4) Economic catalyst — Reduces travel time and logistics costs, promoting trade and regional development.
5) Strategic national link — Enhances national integration, emergency response capacity, and access to markets and services.

c Planning for a major Jamuna crossing began decades earlier as part of national development studies; detailed design and financing arrangements were finalized in the 1990s. Construction began after final approvals and mobilization, continued through intensive civil works (piers, decks, approaches), and the main bridge works were completed in the late 1990s. The structure was inaugurated soon after completion. The project involved Bangladesh government agencies (roads/rail authorities), international consultants for design and supervision, and a consortium of international and local contractors; funding and technical support came from both national budgets and international development partners.

d The bridge boosted the national economy by cutting transport costs and travel time, stimulating regional trade and investment. It improved access to markets, education, and health services for formerly isolated districts, raising livelihoods and social mobility. Additionally, it strengthened disaster relief and national connectivity, enhancing resilience and integration.

Explanation:
The paragraph in part (a) synthesizes the bridge's purpose (linking east and west), its mixed transport and utility roles, and its symbolic and economic importance. Part (b) breaks down tangible features that explain why the bridge is consequential: transport modes, utilities, resilience, economic effects, and strategic value. Part (c) provides a concise timeline framework without exact contentious dates, focusing on project stages (planning, construction, inauguration) and the typical mix of participants—government agencies, international consultants, contractors, and development partners—which is standard for large infrastructure in developing countries. Part (d) highlights three clear, high-level impacts (economic, social, and resilience) that follow logically from improved connectivity: reduced costs and travel time, better access to services, and stronger emergency/logistics capacity. Together, the answers mirror the style of the original prompt—an informative paragraph plus targeted sub-answers—while remaining a distinct and original treatment of a similar infrastructural topic.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Application to the Principal (Formal Letter)

15 September 2025

The Principal
Y College
City

Subject: Request for immediate measures to ensure safe drinking water in the college campus

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am a student of Class XII (Roll No. 23). I write on behalf of the students of Y College to draw your urgent attention to the unsafe and irregular supply of drinking water in our campus over the past few months. Many students have reported stomach illnesses and other waterborne symptoms after drinking tap water. As we are a large student body and many of us attend long practical and tutorial sessions, access to safe drinking water is essential for health and proper study.

In view of the above, I respectfully request that the college take the following immediate measures:
1. Arrange portable water dispensers or bottled water at main student areas until a permanent solution is in place.
2. Install a certified water purifier(s) or filter unit on the main supply line and carry out immediate water quality testing.
3. Ensure a regular cleaning and maintenance schedule for overhead tanks and pipelines.
4. Inform students about any interim safety precautions and provide first-aid information.

We believe these steps will prevent further illness and help maintain a healthy learning environment. We are ready to cooperate with the administration and the students' council in implementing these measures.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Name]
Class XII, Roll No. 23
On behalf of the students of Y College

b Short Notice for Noticeboard

NOTICE

Date: 15 September 2025

Due to irregular water quality in the campus, temporary safe drinking water will be provided at the following places from 16 September until further notice:
- Ground floor opposite the library (water dispensers)
- Canteen entrance (bottled water counter)

Students are requested to use only the designated points for drinking water and to avoid drinking directly from classroom taps until the college completes water testing and purification. Please maintain cleanliness around dispensers. For any health concerns, contact the college infirmary.

Office of the Principal

c Complaint Letter to Municipal Water Authority

15 September 2025

The Superintendent
Municipal Water Supply Department
City

Subject: Request for urgent water quality inspection and assistance at Y College

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing on behalf of the students of Y College, located at [college address]. For several months the college water supply has been intermittent and recent tests (informal on-site observations) suggest contamination leading to student illnesses. The college administration has been informed but immediate corrective measures have not yet been implemented.

We request the Municipal Water Supply Department to kindly:
1. Conduct an urgent inspection and laboratory analysis of the water supplied to Y College (incoming main and internal storage tanks).
2. Advise on the source and extent of contamination and recommend remedial actions.
3. Provide technical support or certify water treatment units suitable for campus use.

If we do not receive a response within seven days, we will be compelled to escalate the matter through higher civic channels to ensure student safety. We hope for your prompt assistance in this public-health matter.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
Class XII, Y College
On behalf of concerned students

d Persuasive Paragraph for Morning Assembly

Fellow students,

Safe drinking water is a basic necessity and our right. Recently several classmates have fallen ill because of unsafe water, which affects both health and studies. Until the college completes purification and testing, please use only the designated water points, carry your own clean bottles, avoid sharing drinking glasses, and wash hands before eating. Support the students' council’s campaign for permanent water-purification measures by following these precautions and reporting any leaks or unclean tanks. Together we can protect our health and keep our campus safe.



Explanation:
This solution set provides four documents tailored to different recipients and purposes while maintaining a consistent, formal tone where appropriate.

- For the application (a): The letter follows a standard formal structure—date, recipient, subject, salutation, body with clear requests, and a closing signature. It states the problem, provides its impact (student illnesses), and lists specific, realistic remedies (temporary dispensers, purifier installation, tank cleaning, and communication). This helps the Principal see both urgency and feasible actions.

- For the noticeboard (b): Notices must be brief, actionable, and visible. The notice states dates, locations for temporary water, a clear instruction (use designated points), and a health advisory. It uses short lines and headings for easy reading.

- For the municipal complaint (c): When seeking external help, the letter formally addresses the authority, describes the problem and prior steps, and asks for inspection, analysis, and technical support. It also sets a timeline (response within seven days), which can prompt quicker action and establishes a record for escalation if needed.

- For the assembly paragraph (d): Oral messages should be concise, persuasive, and instructive. This paragraph highlights the importance, immediate actions students should take (use designated points, carry clean bottles, hygiene), and asks for community support, balancing caution with constructive steps.

Tone and language: Formal letters use respectful salutations and specific requests; the notice is direct and practical; the assembly paragraph is motivational and concise. Including concrete measures (temporary dispensers, testing, maintenance schedule) makes requests actionable and increases the chance of administrative response. Contact details and signatures help accountability and follow-up.

Question:
You are preparing a short assignment on contemporary environmental health. The task focuses on composing a concise, informative paragraph on how a global environmental problem affects people, plus short follow-up tasks that extract and explain key points from that paragraph.

Options:
a. Write a paragraph of about 200 words on "Climate Change and Human Health".
b. List four specific human health effects mentioned in the paragraph.
c. Name three public health measures recommended in the paragraph to reduce harm.
d. Define "greenhouse gas emissions" in one clear sentence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Climate change poses an escalating threat to human health across the globe. Rising average temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events are altering the distribution of infectious diseases, exacerbating respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, and undermining food and water security. Heatwaves increase the risk of heatstroke and dehydration, particularly for elderly and socioeconomically vulnerable populations, while droughts reduce crop yields and threaten nutrition. Heavy rainfall and floods contaminate drinking water and facilitate outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as cholera. Changes in temperature and humidity expand the habitats of disease vectors like mosquitoes, heightening transmission of malaria, dengue, and Zika. Air pollution from wildfire smoke and increased ground-level ozone aggravates asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mental health impacts, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress, frequently follow climate-related disasters and displacement. Effective public health responses require strengthening surveillance systems, enhancing emergency preparedness, improving urban planning to reduce heat exposure, and ensuring equitable access to healthcare and resilient food systems. International cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt infrastructures is essential to protect populations now and into the future. Individuals can also contribute by reducing energy consumption, supporting sustainable transport, and advocating for policies that prioritize public health and environmental justice.

b Four specific human health effects mentioned: 1) heatstroke and dehydration (from heatwaves); 2) worsened respiratory and cardiovascular conditions (from heat and air pollution); 3) waterborne disease outbreaks such as cholera (from contaminated water after floods); 4) increased vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue (due to expanded mosquito habitats).

c Three public health measures recommended: 1) strengthen surveillance systems to detect and track disease and heat-related illness; 2) enhance emergency preparedness and disaster response (including flood and heatwave plans); 3) improve urban planning to reduce heat exposure and ensure resilient food and water systems, plus ensuring equitable access to healthcare.

d "Greenhouse gas emissions" defined: Emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide released by human activities and natural processes that trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere and drive global warming.

Explanation:
The paragraph (solution a) synthesizes well-established pathways by which climate change affects human health: extreme heat, altered precipitation, and changing ecosystems. For part b, the four health effects are explicitly described in the paragraph and reflect common, evidence-based outcomes of climate impacts: heat-related illness, worsening cardio-respiratory diseases, waterborne infections after flooding, and spread of vector-borne diseases. Part c lists public health interventions emphasized in the paragraph; these are standard adaptation measures that reduce vulnerability and improve response capacity (surveillance identifies outbreaks early, preparedness mitigates disaster impacts, and urban planning reduces exposure). Part d provides a concise technical definition: greenhouse gases are defined by their role in trapping heat—this links directly to why reducing these emissions is central to limiting future climate-related health harms. The answers are drawn directly from the paragraph content and from widely accepted public health and climate science concepts.

Question:
Imagine you are asked to persuade a group of students about adopting an early-morning habit to boost their daily productivity. The organizer wants a short composition, some concrete benefits, a sample morning schedule, and practical tips to help students become early risers.

Options:
a. Write a paragraph titled "How Rising Early Boosts Productivity" in about 200 words.
b. List and explain three physical benefits of waking up early.
c. Give an example morning routine (times and activities) for a student aiming to be productive.
d. Provide two practical, evidence-based tips to help someone become an early riser and stick to it.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Answer:
How Rising Early Boosts Productivity

Rising early transforms the way we approach the day by creating space for calm, focus, and intentional action. In the quiet hours of the morning distractions are fewer, allowing uninterrupted time for planning, reflection, and deep work; this heightened focus makes complex tasks more manageable and reduces the need for late-night catch-up. Physiologically, exposure to morning light helps regulate the circadian rhythm and improves alertness and mood, while a short routine of stretching or exercise increases blood flow and cognitive sharpness. Early mornings also allow for a consistent breakfast and mindful preparation, which stabilizes energy and decision-making throughout the day. By prioritizing the most important tasks when willpower and concentration are highest, early risers often finish essential work sooner and feel less stress. Over weeks, this habit builds a dependable schedule that improves sleep quality and overall well-being. In short, waking early provides a regular, serene window for high-value activities, supports better health, and creates momentum that carries productivity through the rest of the day.

b Answer:
1) Improved cardiovascular health: Morning exercise such as brisk walking or light jogging boosts circulation and supports heart health by lowering blood pressure and improving lipid profiles when done regularly. 2) Better metabolic regulation: Eating a balanced breakfast soon after waking stabilizes blood glucose, reducing mid-morning energy crashes and helping maintain a healthy metabolism. 3) Enhanced sleep quality: Consistent early wake times strengthen the circadian rhythm, leading to deeper, more restorative sleep at night and reduced daytime drowsiness.

c Answer:
Example Morning Routine for a Student:
- 6:00 am: Wake up, open curtains for natural light, drink a glass of water.
- 6:05–6:25 am: Light exercise or stretching (20 minutes) to increase alertness.
- 6:25–6:40 am: Shower and get dressed.
- 6:40–7:00 am: Healthy breakfast and quick review of priorities for the day.
- 7:00–8:30 am: Focused study block (highest-priority subject) with phone on Do Not Disturb.
- 8:30–8:45 am: Short break and prepare to leave or shift to classes/other tasks.
This routine balances physical activity, nourishment, and a solid early work period when cognitive performance is typically high.

d Answer:
1) Gradual shifting with a fixed wake time: Move your wake-up time earlier by 10–15 minutes every 2–3 days until you reach the target time, and keep that wake time consistent every day (including weekends) to reset your circadian clock. 2) Anchor your morning with a rewarding ritual: Pair waking up with something you enjoy (a favorite tea, a short walk, or 20 minutes of an engaging book) so your brain associates the earlier hour with positive outcomes; combine this with limiting evening screens and a wind-down routine to make falling asleep earlier easier.

Explanation:
The paragraph in (a) emphasizes structure: quiet time for deep work, physiological benefits (light and exercise), consistent nutrition, and long-term effects on sleep—these are common, research-backed mechanisms linking early rising to productivity. In (b) the three physical benefits were chosen because cardiovascular fitness, metabolic stability, and sleep regulation are primary, measurable outcomes tied to morning routines. For (c) the schedule is realistic for students: a short exercise window, breakfast, then a focused study block early when attention is fresh; times are adjustable but show the principle of prioritizing high-value tasks early. For (d) the tips use behavioral principles: small, gradual changes reduce resistance and preserve sleep health, while positive reinforcement (a morning reward) increases habit persistence; both strategies are supported by sleep hygiene and habit-formation research.

Question:
You are advising a friend who must decide whether to relocate to a large metropolitan city or settle in a quiet rural town. Consider social, economic, health, and lifestyle factors as you present your analysis and advice.

Options:
a. Write a compare and contrast paragraph (maximum 200 words) that summarizes the main differences and similarities between metropolitan (city) life and rural (country) life.
b. List three clear advantages of metropolitan (city) life.
c. List three clear advantages of rural (country) life.
d. Give a personal recommendation (50–60 words) for someone weighing both options; justify your choice.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Answer: Choosing between metropolitan and rural life means balancing pace, opportunity, and environment. Cities concentrate jobs, specialized healthcare, higher education, cultural institutions, and diverse social scenes, offering fast transit and plentiful services but often bringing higher living costs, noise, and pollution. Rural areas provide cleaner air, lower housing costs, more private space, closer ties to nature, and stronger local community bonds, but they typically lack specialist medical care, broad job markets, and certain conveniences. Technological advances like remote work and e-commerce have narrowed some gaps—allowing people to access urban salaries or services while living outside crowded centers—yet differences in lifestyle and daily rhythms remain: urban life is fast and opportunistic; rural life is slower and restorative. Personal priorities—career goals, family needs, health concerns, and social preferences—should guide the choice, while better regional planning and infrastructure can blend strengths of both environments. (Approx. 150–180 words)

b Answer:
1. Concentrated employment and career growth opportunities across many industries.
2. Wide access to specialized healthcare, higher education, cultural institutions, and entertainment.
3. Better public transportation, diverse social networks, and more immediate services and amenities.

c Answer:
1. Lower cost of living and more affordable, spacious housing.
2. Cleaner environment, less noise, and a slower pace that can benefit mental and physical health.
3. Stronger local community ties, safer outdoor spaces, and greater access to nature and agricultural opportunities.

d Answer: If immediate career advancement, cultural variety, and easy access to specialist services matter most, choose the city; if you prioritize space, affordability, and tranquility, choose the countryside. For many, the ideal compromise is a well-connected small town or suburb that allows access to urban jobs and services while preserving community and open space—especially now that remote work makes this hybrid lifestyle practical. (Approx. 55 words)

Explanation:
The paragraph (a) was structured to compare economic, social, and environmental aspects while noting how technology (remote work, e-commerce) reduces differences. Sub-answers (b) and (c) give concise, high-impact advantages intended to help quick decision-making: one set emphasizes opportunity and services; the other emphasizes cost, health, and community. The recommendation (d) balances trade-offs and reflects current trends (remote/hybrid work), advising a practical compromise (small town/suburb) that suits many people. When writing a compare-and-contrast paragraph, start with a clear framing sentence, then present paired points (urban advantage vs rural advantage), acknowledge overlaps or bridging factors, and conclude with a judgement tied to priorities; this keeps the piece focused and within the word limit.

Question:
Many households are feeling the pinch as prices of food, fuel, and everyday goods rise rapidly. The media, markets, and government debates focus on how these rising prices affect family budgets, business costs, and national development. Use this situation to respond to the following tasks.

Options:
a. Write a cause-and-effect paragraph on "Rising Inflation", briefly describing the main causes and its impacts on everyday life.
b. List five immediate short-term actions the government can take to relieve ordinary people from the burden of rising prices, with one-sentence justification for each.
c. Suggest three practical steps households can adopt to cope with higher prices, explaining how each step helps.
d. Propose two long-term structural policies to stabilize prices and explain why each would be effective.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Rising Inflation: Causes and Effects

Rising inflation refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services. Its causes are often a mix of demand-pull factors (when aggregate demand grows faster than supply), cost-push pressures (higher costs for raw materials, energy, or wages), supply chain disruptions, currency depreciation that makes imports costlier, and speculative hoarding or market manipulation. The effects touch everyday life: household budgets shrink as food, fuel, and utilities consume a larger share of income; low- and fixed-income families face increased food insecurity and health risks; businesses incur higher production costs, which can reduce hiring or raise unemployment; savings lose real value, discouraging investment; and social tension may rise as inequality widens. In short, inflation erodes purchasing power and can slow overall development if left unchecked.

b Five Immediate Government Actions (with one-line justification each)

1. Targeted subsidies or cash transfers to vulnerable households — cushions the poorest from immediate price shocks without broad market distortions.
2. Release government-held food and fuel reserves into the market — increases short-run supply and eases price spikes.
3. Temporarily reduce or suspend tariffs and taxes on essential imports — lowers import costs and retail prices quickly.
4. Strengthen market monitoring and anti-hoarding enforcement — prevents artificial shortages and punishes profiteering.
5. Provide short-term support to critical supply chains (transport, storage) — reduces distribution bottlenecks that push up prices.

c Three Practical Household Steps (with explanation)

1. Prioritize spending and create a weekly budget focusing on essentials — helps households track spending, cut nonessential purchases, and stretch limited income.
2. Switch to cost-effective substitutes and buy in bulk for non-perishables — reduces unit cost and buffers against frequent price changes.
3. Increase home-level food planning (meal planning, preservation, small-scale gardening where possible) — lowers dependence on market purchases and reduces waste.

d Two Long-Term Structural Policies (with explanation)

1. Invest in domestic agricultural productivity and storage infrastructure — expanding local food production and better storage reduces reliance on imports, stabilizes supply, and lowers volatility from seasonal shortages.
2. Maintain prudent macroeconomic policy (stable monetary policy to anchor inflation expectations plus fiscal discipline) — controlling money supply growth and reducing unsustainable deficits keeps inflation expectations stable, which prevents wage-price spirals and preserves purchasing power.

Explanation:
Reasoning behind the solution:

Paragraph (a): The paragraph links common economic causes of inflation (demand-pull, cost-push, supply shocks, currency effects, and market distortions) to observable impacts on households, firms, and the economy. This structure shows cause leading to effect and highlights why inflation matters for daily life.

Short-term government actions (b): These measures are chosen because they can be implemented quickly and target either supply (releasing reserves, supporting supply chains), demand (targeted transfers), or market functioning (anti-hoarding, tariff adjustments). The aim is to alleviate immediate hardship while avoiding measures that would fuel inflation further (e.g., broad untargeted subsidies financed by large deficits).

Household steps (c): Practical, low-cost behavioral changes (budgeting, substitution, meal planning) reduce exposure to price swings and improve resilience. Buying in bulk and preserving food reduce per-unit costs and frequency of purchases, which helps when prices are rising.

Long-term policies (d): Structural responses address root causes: increasing productive capacity (especially in agriculture for food price stability) and anchoring macroeconomic expectations. Investment in productivity reduces supply constraints; sound monetary and fiscal policies prevent excessive demand growth and preserve the currency’s value, both central to long-run price stability.

Overall, combining immediate relief, household adaptation, and long-term structural reform creates a balanced strategy to manage rising prices without creating new economic problems.

Question:
Write a coherent descriptive piece about your favourite teacher, portraying their personality, teaching style, and the impact they have had on you and your classmates. Include a personal example that shows why they are memorable.

Options:
a. Write a paragraph of about 200 words on "My Favourite Teacher" following the given context.
b. List five qualities of this teacher and give a brief explanation (1–2 sentences each) why each quality matters.
c. Describe a short personal anecdote (3–5 sentences) that demonstrates the teacher's influence or kindness.
d. Suggest three practical ways students can show appreciation to such a teacher.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a My Favourite Teacher

My favourite teacher is Mr. Karim, who teaches science at our school. He is calm, patient and incredibly curious, which makes every lesson feel like an invitation to explore. His classes are always well organized: he begins with a simple question to spark our interest, demonstrates an experiment or example, and then encourages us to test ideas in small groups. He uses everyday situations to explain difficult concepts, so abstract topics become easy to visualize. Beyond academics, Mr. Karim cares deeply about our confidence and character; he spends extra time with those who struggle and praises effort as much as success. His voice is steady and encouraging, and he listens carefully to our questions without rushing. Once, when our class failed a lab report, he stayed after school for a week to help us redo our work, not for his credit but to ensure we understood the process. Because of him, many students who once disliked science now participate eagerly in discussions and projects. I admire his dedication, his respectful treatment of everyone, and the way he makes learning both challenging and enjoyable — qualities that make him unforgettable as a teacher and a mentor.

b Five qualities:
1) Patience — He explains difficult ideas slowly and returns to them until students understand, which builds confidence.
2) Clarity — He organizes lessons with clear steps and examples, helping students follow complex topics easily.
3) Encouragement — He praises effort and improvement, motivating students to try without fear of failure.
4) Practicality — He links theory to real-life examples, making lessons relevant and memorable.
5) Empathy — He notices students' struggles and offers time and support beyond class hours.

c Anecdote:
Once our class performed poorly on a chemistry practical. Instead of scolding, Mr. Karim scheduled extra sessions after school, brought simpler materials, and guided each group patiently through the steps. By the end of the week, every student had not only corrected the procedure but also expressed genuine interest in repeating the experiment at home.

d Ways to show appreciation:
1) Write a heartfelt thank-you note describing specific help they provided. 2) Organize a small surprise (e.g., a card or group photo) from the class to acknowledge their efforts. 3) Demonstrate appreciation through actions: apply what they taught, participate actively, and maintain respectful behaviour in class.

Explanation:
The solution is structured to meet each sub-question precisely. For part (a) the paragraph follows a clear descriptive pattern: introduction of the teacher, description of teaching style, examples of personality and methods, a personal anecdote showing impact, and a concluding sentence stating why the teacher is memorable. This structure ensures coherence and covers personality, pedagogy and influence — all elements requested in the context. Part (b) lists five qualities chosen because they commonly affect student learning and classroom climate; each quality has a concise rationale linking it to student outcomes (understanding, motivation, relevance, emotional support). Part (c) gives a brief, concrete anecdote illustrating the teacher's supportive behavior and its positive result, which provides evidence for claims made in the paragraph. Part (d) suggests practical, low-cost, and meaningful ways students can express appreciation: written thanks, a group gesture, and continued respectful engagement — all actions that convey gratitude and reinforce the teacher's impact. The overall answers model clear writing, use specific examples, and balance emotional and practical elements so the piece is both descriptive and actionable.

Question:
Context: You have been asked to prepare material for a school assembly about moral values and their influence on individuals and society. The material should include a short written piece, concrete examples, and practical suggestions for teaching morals to students.

Options:
a. Write a paragraph (about 200 words) titled "Role of Moral Values in Personal and Social Life."
b. List five important moral values and give one-sentence explanations for each.
c. Describe two realistic moral dilemmas a student might face and explain how they should be resolved.
d. Suggest three practical activities or methods a school can use to teach moral values effectively, with brief reasons why each works.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Role of Moral Values in Personal and Social Life

Moral values are the guiding principles that shape our choices, behavior, and relationships. They help individuals distinguish right from wrong and promote qualities such as honesty, compassion, responsibility, and respect. At the personal level, moral values build character: they encourage self-discipline, foster trustworthiness, and support emotional well-being by aligning actions with conscience. When people practice moral values consistently, they form reliable habits that make everyday decisions easier and healthier. Socially, shared moral values create a foundation for peaceful coexistence; they reduce conflicts, encourage cooperation, and enable collective problem-solving. Communities that prize fairness and empathy tend to have stronger social bonds and greater public trust. Moreover, moral values guide citizens in fulfilling civic duties—respecting laws, protecting the vulnerable, and contributing to the common good. Teaching and modeling these values in families, schools, and public life ensures their transmission across generations. In a rapidly changing world, moral values provide a stable moral compass that helps individuals and societies navigate ethical challenges, preserve dignity, and build inclusive, resilient communities.

b Five important moral values (one-sentence explanations):
1. Honesty — Telling the truth and being transparent builds trust and credibility with others.
2. Respect — Valuing others' rights, feelings, and opinions fosters peaceful and cooperative relationships.
3. Responsibility — Accepting the consequences of one’s actions ensures reliability and social accountability.
4. Compassion — Showing kindness and empathy helps relieve others’ suffering and strengthens community ties.
5. Fairness — Treating people impartially and justly promotes equality and reduces resentment.

c Two moral dilemmas and resolutions:
1. Dilemma: A student sees a classmate cheating on a test; reporting the cheating could get the classmate punished, but staying silent undermines fairness. Resolution: The student should first encourage the classmate to admit the mistake and stop; if the cheating continues or affects others’ outcomes, the student should report the incident to a teacher, emphasizing fairness and the long-term harm of dishonest behavior. The approach balances compassion with responsibility to uphold integrity.
2. Dilemma: A student finds a lost phone with messages revealing private problems of the owner; returning it preserves privacy but reading or sharing the messages would be tempting. Resolution: The student should not read or share the messages and should return the phone immediately to school authorities or attempt to contact the owner, respecting privacy and practicing honesty.

d Three practical school activities/methods to teach moral values (with reasons):
1. Role-playing and drama exercises — These let students practice ethical choices in safe, realistic scenarios, building empathy and decision-making skills through experiential learning.
2. Classroom discussions of short stories or current events — Guided conversations about characters’ choices help students analyze consequences, appreciate diverse perspectives, and apply moral principles to real situations.
3. Community service projects — Hands-on service teaches responsibility, compassion, and civic-mindedness while connecting classroom values to tangible benefits for others.

Explanation:
This solution is designed to be practical for a school assembly. The paragraph (a) summarizes why moral values matter individually and socially, giving a concise but complete view suitable for about 200 words. The list in (b) picks five widely recognized core values and gives single-sentence rationales so learners can grasp the essence quickly. In (c), each dilemma is realistic for students and the resolutions balance competing moral considerations (compassion vs. fairness, privacy vs. honesty) while offering concrete steps to resolve the conflict ethically. For (d), the suggested activities are evidence-based pedagogical approaches: role-play promotes empathy through enactment; discussion develops critical thinking and moral reasoning; community service links values to civic action and reinforces internalization through practice. Altogether, these components provide both content and methods to communicate moral values effectively to young learners and to help them apply those values in everyday situations.

Question:
Context: Consider the growing problem of plastic waste in cities and coastal areas. Single-use plastics, improper disposal, and limited recycling have led to visible litter, clogged drains, and harmed wildlife. You are asked to analyze this situation and respond to specific tasks below.

Options:
a. Write a cause-and-effect paragraph on "Plastic Pollution". Your paragraph should not exceed 180 words.
b. Name three primary causes of plastic pollution with one-sentence explanations for each.
c. List three major effects of plastic pollution on the environment and human health (one sentence each).
d. Suggest three practical measures communities can take to reduce plastic pollution, with a brief rationale for each.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Plastic Pollution

Plastic pollution occurs when plastic materials accumulate in the environment, damaging ecosystems and human well-being. Single-use plastics like bags, bottles and packaging are produced in large quantities and often discarded after a brief use; poor waste management and littering allow these items to reach streets, rivers and oceans. Once in nature, plastics break into microplastics that persist for decades, entering food chains and contaminating water and soil. Marine animals mistake plastic for food, causing injury or death, while blocked drains and sewers increase flood risk in urban areas. Plastic production also relies on fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing plastic pollution therefore requires cutting needless plastic use, improving collection and recycling systems, and encouraging alternatives and policies that hold producers responsible. (Approx. 128 words)

b Causes
1. Overuse of single-use plastics: Convenience culture drives heavy consumption of disposable bags, bottles and wrappers that are rapidly thrown away.
2. Inadequate waste management: Insufficient collection, landfill capacity and recycling infrastructure allow plastics to escape into the environment.
3. Littering and illegal dumping: Public behavior and weak enforcement result in plastics reaching waterways and natural habitats.

c Effects
1. Wildlife harm: Animals ingest or become entangled in plastics, leading to injury, starvation or death.
2. Human health risks: Microplastics enter food and water supplies, with potential effects on digestion, chemical exposure, and long-term health still under study.
3. Environmental degradation: Plastics persist for decades, polluting beaches, clogging drains (increasing flood risk), and contributing to ecosystem decline.

d Measures
1. Reduce and replace: Promote reusable bags, refillable bottles and alternative materials to cut demand for single-use plastics; this directly reduces waste generation.
2. Improve waste systems: Invest in collection, sorting and recycling infrastructure and extend producer responsibility to ensure plastics are managed, not discarded.
3. Public education and enforcement: Run awareness campaigns and enforce anti-littering laws to change behavior and prevent illegal dumping, protecting waterways and communities.

Explanation:
The paragraph (a) links causes (production and mismanagement) to effects (wildlife harm, microplastics, flooding) and actions required (reduce, manage, policy), keeping within the word limit. Part (b) focuses on proximal drivers: consumer habits, systemic infrastructure gaps, and illegal disposal—each directly leads to environmental leakage of plastics. Part (c) highlights distinct impact categories: ecological (animal harm), human health (microplastic contamination and chemical exposure), and broader environmental/systemic impacts (persistence, flood risk). Part (d) gives practical, scalable interventions: source reduction (most effective), system improvements (necessary for existing plastics), and behavior/policy measures (to sustain change). Together these answers show cause-effect links and feasible responses to plastic pollution.

Question:
You have been asked to prepare material for a school magazine and a classroom presentation to mark International Mother Language Day. The editor wants a short essay for the magazine and additional notes the teacher can use for a class discussion and activities.

Options:
a. Write a paragraph of about 200 words on "Mother Language and Cultural Identity" suitable for the school magazine.
b. Briefly state the historical origin of International Mother Language Day (include key date(s) and a one-sentence summary of the event).
c. Name two common ways people in Bangladesh observe this day, with one short sentence for each.
d. Suggest three practical activities schools can run to promote the mother tongue among students (one sentence per activity).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Paragraph (about 200 words):
Mother Language and Cultural Identity

Language is more than a tool for communication; it is the living thread that binds people to their history, values, and collective memory. A mother tongue carries within it folktales, idioms, songs, and expressions that reveal how a community understands the world and its place in it. When children learn in their mother language, they grasp concepts more deeply and retain knowledge more effectively, which supports both cognitive development and emotional well-being. Preserving and celebrating our native languages also protects cultural diversity against the homogenizing pressures of globalization. Each language embodies unique ways of thinking and solving problems, and its loss diminishes humanity’s shared intellectual heritage. Observances like International Mother Language Day remind us to honor those who sacrificed for linguistic rights and to advocate for inclusive education policies that respect linguistic plurality. By nurturing mother tongues at home and in schools, societies empower individuals to participate fully in civic life while keeping rich traditions alive for future generations.

b Historical origin:
On 21 February 1952 students and citizens in then-East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) protested for recognition of their language, Bangla; police fired on the demonstrators and several protesters were killed—UNESCO later declared 21 February as International Mother Language Day to honor those events and promote linguistic and cultural diversity.

c Two common observances in Bangladesh:
- People place flowers and wreaths at the Shaheed Minar to pay homage to the language martyrs.
- Cultural programs, poetry recitations, and processions are held throughout the day to celebrate the language and its literature.

d Three practical school activities to promote the mother tongue:
- Storytelling sessions where elders or teachers narrate folk tales in the mother tongue, followed by student retellings to build oral skills.
- A ‘‘Mother Tongue Day’’ project fair in which students create posters, short plays, and audio recordings showcasing regional dialects and vocabulary.
- Bilingual reading corners stocked with children’s books in the mother tongue and paired translations to encourage reading and language comparison.

Explanation:
The paragraph in (a) emphasizes both educational and cultural reasons for valuing mother tongues: cognitive benefits for learners and the role of language in preserving collective memory. In (b) the answer gives the concise historical fact—the 21 February 1952 shootings—and links it to UNESCO’s declaration, which is the widely recognized origin of the international observance. For (c) I chose the two most visible and widespread practices in Bangladesh: paying tribute at the Shaheed Minar and cultural performances; these are typical and easily verifiable. For (d) the suggested school activities are practical, low-cost, and directly support active use of the mother tongue: oral tradition (storytelling), creative student projects (fair), and reading support (bilingual reading corners). Each activity fosters engagement, literacy, and pride in linguistic heritage while being adaptable to different school sizes and resources.

Question:
Smartphones and mobile apps now touch almost every part of our daily lives: communication, learning, work, entertainment, health tracking, and shopping. While they bring convenience and new opportunities, they can also lead to distraction, privacy risks, and health concerns. Consider the balanced view of how smartphones affect individuals and society.

Options:
a. Write a paragraph (about 180–220 words) titled "Benefits of Smartphones in Everyday Life".
b. List five specific ways smartphones can enhance education and learning for students.
c. Describe three major negative effects of excessive smartphone use and offer one practical solution for each effect.
d. Explain two measures schools and two measures governments can take to reduce smartphone misuse while preserving their educational benefits.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Benefits of Smartphones in Everyday Life

Smartphones have revolutionized how people connect, learn, and manage daily tasks. They provide instant communication through calls, messaging, and video, allowing families and colleagues to stay in touch across distances. As portable mini-computers, smartphones give access to the internet, enabling real-time information retrieval, online banking, navigation, and e-commerce. They support productivity with calendars, reminders, document editing, and cloud synchronization, helping users organize work and personal life efficiently. In education, smartphones host e-books, educational apps, and video lectures that make self-paced and remote learning possible. Health and fitness applications promote wellness by tracking steps, sleep, and vital signs, and by reminding users to take medications or exercise. For entertainment, smartphones stream music, movies, games, and social content, offering relaxation and creative expression. Additionally, smartphones empower small businesses and freelancers through mobile payment systems, digital marketing, and remote client communication. When used mindfully, smartphones enhance convenience, accessibility, and opportunities for economic and social participation across age groups.

b Five ways smartphones enhance education

1. Access to educational resources: e-books, online courses, and scholarly articles anytime.
2. Interactive learning apps: language apps, simulations, and quizzes that reinforce concepts.
3. Communication and collaboration: messaging, video calls, and cloud docs for group projects and teacher feedback.
4. Personalized learning: adaptive apps that adjust difficulty and track student progress.
5. Field learning and data collection: cameras, sensors, and GPS for experiments, observations, and real-world projects.

c Three negative effects of excessive smartphone use and solutions

1. Effect: Attention loss and reduced concentration, harming study and work quality.
   Solution: Implement scheduled phone-free study periods (e.g., Pomodoro technique) and use focus apps to block distracting notifications during work sessions.

2. Effect: Sleep disturbance from screen exposure and late-night use, leading to fatigue and cognitive decline.
   Solution: Enforce a digital curfew—avoid screens at least one hour before bedtime—and enable night mode/blue-light filters plus do-not-disturb during sleep hours.

3. Effect: Social isolation and mental health impacts from excessive social media use and comparison.
   Solution: Practice mindful usage by setting daily time limits for social apps, curate social feeds to reduce negative content, and encourage offline social activities and hobbies.

d Measures for schools and governments

Schools:
1. Digital literacy curriculum: Teach students about healthy phone habits, online privacy, critical thinking for digital content, and time-management strategies.
2. Structured smartphone policies: Create balanced rules (e.g., phones off or in lockers during lessons, but allowed for specific educational tasks) combined with supervised tech-based activities.

Governments:
1. Public awareness campaigns: Fund nationwide education on safe smartphone use, addressing mental health, radiation myths, and privacy best practices targeted to parents, students, and educators.
2. Regulation and support: Enact policies that protect user privacy (data protection laws), encourage app transparency, and support schools with resources for digital infrastructure and teacher training.

Explanation:
The solution balances a descriptive paragraph with actionable lists and practical interventions. Part (a) summarizes the broad benefits of smartphones—communication, productivity, education, health, entertainment, and economic utility—while emphasizing mindful use. Part (b) identifies direct educational affordances of smartphones: access, interactivity, collaboration, personalization, and real-world data collection. For part (c), the selected negative effects (attention loss, sleep disruption, social/mental health issues) are common and evidence-backed concerns; each proposed solution is practical, behaviorally oriented, and implementable without heavy cost: structured focus techniques, sleep hygiene measures, and mindful usage limits. Part (d) separates responsibilities: schools handle instruction and daily policies to shape student behavior, while governments run public campaigns and set regulations to protect users and enable safe, equitable access. Overall, the answers aim to be realistic and actionable—promoting the benefits of smartphones while providing feasible measures to mitigate harms.

Question:
A secondary school's English department has observed a steady decline in students' performance and confidence in using English. The headteacher asks for a concise analysis and practical responses that can be used in a departmental meeting and in classroom practice.

Options:
a. Write a paragraph (150–200 words) analyzing the main causes and likely effects of poor English proficiency among secondary students.
b. List five specific, actionable remedies the department can implement next term, with one-sentence justifications for each.
c. Propose three simple assessment methods to diagnose the primary causes of students' poor performance.
d. Design a short in-class speaking activity (aim, materials, step-by-step procedure, timing) that teachers can use immediately to boost confidence.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Paragraph:
Poor English proficiency among secondary students often stems from limited daily exposure, weak foundational grammar and vocabulary, exam-centered teaching, and insufficiently trained or overloaded teachers. Socio-economic factors and lack of English use at home further reduce opportunities for practice. As a result, students develop low communicative confidence, perform poorly in both written and oral assessments, and miss higher-education and employment opportunities that demand fluent English. The classroom climate may become teacher-dominated and test-oriented, which reinforces rote memorization rather than meaningful language use. Over time, negative experiences create a vicious cycle: students avoid speaking, their listening and speaking skills atrophy, and motivation declines. Addressing these issues requires shifting toward communicative, learner-centered practices, improving teacher training and resources, and creating regular, low-stakes opportunities for real communication so students build competence and confidence incrementally.

b Remedies:
1) Weekly spoken-English clubs (15–20 min) to build routine, low-pressure practice. 
2) Short teacher professional-development sessions on communicative methods to improve classroom input. 
3) Integrate English across subjects (labels, simple instructions) to increase exposure. 
4) Use graded readers and audio for extra practice, including at-home listening tasks. 
5) Replace some high-stakes test items with formative tasks (presentations, portfolios) to reward real use.

c Assessment methods:
1) Diagnostic vocabulary & grammar quick test (20–30 items) to map gaps. 
2) 5–7 minute recorded speaking task for fluency and pronunciation analysis. 
3) Student survey/interviews about study habits, home language use, and attitudes to identify motivational and socio-economic factors.

d Classroom activity (20 minutes):
Aim: Boost speaking fluency and cooperative interaction.
Materials: Prompt cards with everyday scenarios (shopping, asking directions), timer, simple feedback checklist.
Procedure: (1) Warm-up (2 min): teacher models a 1-minute dialogue. (2) Pair role-play (8 min): students take turns with two cards, 2 rounds × 2 min each, switching roles. (3) Group mini-performance (6 min): 3 pairs perform one best dialogue. (4) Feedback & reflection (4 min): peers give 1 positive comment + 1 suggestion; teacher highlights language items to try next time.

Explanation:
The paragraph (a) identifies common systemic and classroom-level causes (exposure, pedagogy, assessment culture, socio-economic context) and links them to observable effects (low confidence, poor outcomes). Remedies (b) are practical, low-cost, and aimed at increasing meaningful input, teacher capacity, and motivation—key factors from second-language acquisition research. Assessment methods (c) include objective diagnostics (tests), performance-based measures (recorded speaking), and affective data (surveys) so teachers can triangulate causes rather than relying on grades alone. The activity (d) follows communicative language teaching principles: clear aim, short meaningful tasks, repetition, peer interaction, low-stakes performance, and immediate formative feedback to build fluency and confidence without overemphasizing accuracy. Together these steps create repeated, scaffolded opportunities for authentic use, which research and classroom practice show are effective for improving proficiency and motivation.

Question:
A neighborhood group has launched an "Urban Greening Campaign" to increase green cover in their town. They plan to plant trees along streets, in schoolyards and small vacant plots. The campaign organizers want written materials and concrete steps to persuade residents, ensure sapling survival, and explain the broader benefits of tree plantation. Use the context to address the following tasks.

Options:
a. Write a paragraph (about 200 words) on "Urban Tree Plantation" suitable for a community newsletter.
b. List five key environmental benefits of planting trees in urban areas, with one-sentence explanations for each.
c. Describe three practical measures residents should take to ensure young saplings survive and grow, giving a short rationale for each measure.
d. Provide a short catchy slogan for the campaign and a four-line motivational couplet (poetic lines) to print on flyers.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Urban Tree Plantation

Urban tree plantation is the deliberate planting and care of trees within cities and towns to enhance environmental quality and community well-being. Trees calm noisy streets, filter dust and pollutants from the air, and reduce urban heat by providing shade and cooling through transpiration. Well-placed trees near homes and schools improve mental health, encourage outdoor activity, and create attractive public spaces that strengthen neighborhood ties. Fruit-bearing and native species can support urban biodiversity by offering food and habitat for birds and pollinators. Thoughtful planning — choosing suitable species, planting at correct distances from utilities, and ensuring space for root growth — reduces future maintenance problems and prolongs tree life. Community involvement in planting days fosters local ownership, while ongoing watering and mulching during the first few years ensure sapling survival. With modest investment and collective effort, urban tree plantation transforms vacant plots and barren streets into healthier, greener places that cool the climate, absorb carbon, conserve soil, and uplift the daily lives of residents.

b Five Environmental Benefits

1. Air purification — Trees absorb pollutants (e.g., particulate matter, NOx) and produce oxygen, improving air quality. 
2. Urban cooling — Shade and evapotranspiration from trees lower ambient temperatures, mitigating heat islands. 
3. Carbon sequestration — Trees capture and store CO2, helping to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. 
4. Stormwater management — Roots and soil beneath trees increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff and flooding. 
5. Biodiversity support — Trees provide habitat and food for birds, insects, and small mammals, increasing urban ecological diversity.

c Three Practical Measures for Sapling Survival

1. Regular watering (first 2–3 years) — Provide deep watering twice a week in dry periods so roots establish; inconsistent moisture leads to weak root systems. 
2. Mulching around the base — Apply a 5–8 cm layer of organic mulch, keeping it away from the trunk; mulch conserves moisture, suppresses weeds, and moderates soil temperature. 
3. Protective staking and guards — Install stakes or tree guards to protect young trunks from wind, animals, and accidental damage; remove or adjust stakes after 12–18 months to allow natural trunk strengthening.

d Slogan and Motivational Couplet

Slogan: "Plant Today, Breathe Tomorrow."

Couplet:
Green roots awaken streets once bare,
Shade, life and hope we gladly share.
Nurture a sapling, watch it rise—
A greener town in every eyes.

Explanation:
This solution provides a community-oriented paragraph of about 200 words emphasizing practical and social aspects of urban tree plantation (section a). The environmental benefits (section b) are concise, focusing on the main ecosystem services trees provide in cities. The practical measures (section c) prioritize early-life care critical for survival: consistent watering builds roots, mulching conserves moisture and improves soil health, and protection prevents physical damage; each measure includes the rationale so residents understand why to act. The slogan and couplet (section d) are crafted for visibility on flyers and to inspire participation; the slogan is short and memorable, while the four-line couplet uses simple imagery to evoke community responsibility and positive outcomes. Together, these parts are suitable for a neighborhood campaign packet: informative for newsletters, actionable for volunteers, and motivational for outreach materials.
