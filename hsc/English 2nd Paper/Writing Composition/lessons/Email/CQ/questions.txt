Hey Tabassum,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to talk to you about something important – your multimedia classes at school. I've noticed that you seem a bit indifferent towards attending these classes, and I wanted to share why they're actually quite valuable.

First of all, multimedia classes provide you with a unique opportunity to learn using different mediums like videos, interactive presentations, and online resources. This can make learning more engaging and fun, helping you understand complex topics in a simpler way. Plus, in today's world, being comfortable with technology and multimedia tools is essential for your future education and career.

Regularly attending multimedia classes will also give you a chance to interact with your classmates and teachers in a different setting. These classes often involve group activities and discussions, which can help you learn from your peers and share your own ideas too. Building these connections can enhance your overall learning experience.

Remember, education is a precious gift, and making the most out of it will benefit you in the long run. Try to approach these multimedia classes with an open mind and a positive attitude. If you're struggling with anything or find something confusing, don't hesitate to ask your teacher or classmates for help – that's what they're there for.

I believe that you have the potential to excel in your studies, and attending multimedia classes regularly will definitely contribute to your success. So, keep an eye on your attendance and actively participate in these classes. You'll find that they can make a real difference in your learning journey.

If you ever want to talk more about this or need any advice, feel free to reach out to me. I'm here to support you!

Take care and keep shining,

Question:
Suppose you are Masum, a student of class XI of Bogura Govt. College, Bogura. Your younger brother, Jamil, has been skipping the computer lab sessions at his school because he thinks they're boring. Prepare materials to persuade him to attend regularly.

Options:
a. Write an email to Jamil advising him to attend computer lab classes regularly (include greeting, body and signature).
b. List four concise reasons why attending computer lab classes regularly is important for a student today.
c. Suggest three practical tips Jamil can follow to make computer lab sessions more engaging and useful.
d. Provide a clear subject line for the email and one polite closing sentence that encourages action.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a Hi Jamil,

I hope you are doing well. I noticed you have been skipping the computer lab sessions lately, and I wanted to share why it’s worth attending them regularly. Computer labs give hands-on experience with software and hardware that you can’t get from textbooks alone. Regular practice will make tasks like typing, presentations, basic programming, and using the internet for study much easier. Lab classes also let you ask your teacher questions on the spot and learn from classmates. Try going to the next two sessions and focus on one small skill each time — I’ll help you practice at home if you want.

Take care,
Masum

b 1) Practical skills: Hands-on experience with software (word processors, spreadsheets, presentations) that are essential for studies and future jobs.
2) Problem-solving: Opportunity to practice troubleshooting and logical thinking (basic programming, debugging, using tools).
3) Digital literacy: Safe and effective use of the internet, file management, and online research skills.
4) Better performance: Many assignments and exams assume familiarity with computers; regular lab attendance improves speed and accuracy.

c 1) Set a small goal for each session: e.g., learn to create a slide, format a document, or write a short script — small wins build interest.
2) Pair up with a classmate or ask the teacher one specific question before class so you have a focused task to complete.
3) Apply what you learn to something you care about (make a poster for a hobby, a simple game idea, or a photo-edit for social media) to make practice meaningful.

d Subject line: "Why the Computer Lab Will Help You — Try Two Sessions"

Polite closing sentence: "Please give the next two lab sessions a try — I’ll help you review what you learn, and I’m sure you’ll notice the difference."

Explanation:
The email in (a) uses a friendly, encouraging tone to reduce resistance and invites a small trial (next two sessions) rather than demanding permanent change — this is more likely to get cooperation. The four reasons in (b) highlight both short-term academic benefits and long-term employability, covering practical, cognitive, and safety aspects of computer use. The tips in (c) are concrete actions Jamil can use immediately: goal-setting, collaboration, and personal relevance, which are proven methods to increase engagement. The subject in (d) is direct and action-oriented, increasing open rates; the closing sentence is supportive and offers help, which reinforces motivation and reduces anxiety about trying again.
