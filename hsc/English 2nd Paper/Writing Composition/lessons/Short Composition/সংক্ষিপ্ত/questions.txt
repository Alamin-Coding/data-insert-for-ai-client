Question:
Deforestation has a great impact on Bangladesh. Because of deforestation our country is gradually turning into a desert. Now, write a short composition on “Deforestation and its Adverse Consequences.” Use 200-250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Composition (Deforestation and its Adverse Consequences )

Deforestation, the widespread clearance of forests for various purposes, poses a severe threat to the environment and has far-reaching consequences for countries like Bangladesh. In recent years, the country has witnessed an alarming rate of deforestation, resulting in significant ecological imbalances and adverse effects on its landscape.

One of the immediate consequences of deforestation is the loss of biodiversity. Forests are home to a diverse range of plant and animal species, many of which are unique and endemic. When trees are felled, habitats are destroyed, leading to the displacement and potential extinction of these species. This loss of biodiversity disrupts ecosystems and weakens their resilience to natural disasters.

Furthermore, deforestation directly contributes to climate change. Trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. The removal of trees not only releases stored carbon back into the atmosphere but also reduces the planet's capacity to mitigate the effects of climate change.

In Bangladesh, deforestation has been a key factor in exacerbating issues like soil erosion and flooding. Trees act as natural barriers against soil erosion, their roots binding the soil together. Without trees, soil becomes susceptible to erosion by wind and water, resulting in barren land and reduced agricultural productivity. Moreover, deforested areas are more prone to flooding as trees help regulate water flow and prevent excessive runoff.

Perhaps the most distressing consequence of deforestation is the degradation of land, often leading to desertification. As trees are removed, the land loses its ability to retain moisture, becoming arid and infertile. This gradual transformation of fertile land into desert-like conditions has significant socio-economic impacts, threatening livelihoods and food security.

To address the adverse consequences of deforestation, concerted efforts are required. Sustainable forest management, afforestation, and reforestation initiatives are crucial to restore ecosystems, mitigate climate change, and preserve biodiversity. Educating communities about the importance of forests and implementing strict regulations against illegal logging are essential steps toward halting this destructive trend.

In conclusion, deforestation poses a serious threat to Bangladesh's environment, economy, and well-being. Its adverse consequences, including loss of biodiversity, climate change, soil erosion, and desertification, underscore the urgent need for collective action to protect and conserve the country's precious forests. Only through responsible stewardship and proactive measures can we ensure a sustainable and thriving future for both our environment and society.

Question:
Write a short composition on “Childhood Memories”. Write within at least 200 words but don’t exceed 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Composition (A Treasured Tapestry of Time )

Childhood memories, woven intricately into the fabric of our past, hold a special place in our hearts. They are like precious gems, gleaming with the innocence, joy, and wonderment that characterized those early years of life.

As I reflect on my childhood, a tapestry of vibrant moments unfolds before my mind's eye. The scent of rain-soaked earth after a downpour, the laughter shared with friends during endless games, and the excitement of discovering new worlds within the pages of a book—these memories remain etched in my soul.

The simplicity of childhood is a treasure in itself. It was a time when worries were limited to the next playtime and happiness was found in the simplest of things—a colorful kite soaring against the sky, a field of wildflowers, or the comforting embrace of a loved one. Each memory carries its own unique blend of emotions, shaping the person I have become.

Childhood memories also teach us invaluable life lessons. They remind us of the resilience and adaptability that we possessed as children. Every scraped knee, every setback in building that towering sandcastle, was a lesson in perseverance. The friendships forged during those years taught us the significance of loyalty and companionship, traits that continue to influence our adult relationships.

Yet, as we grow older, childhood memories can also be bittersweet. They transport us to a time of innocence and carefree days, reminding us of the passage of time and the inevitability of change. The nostalgia they evoke can be a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of life.

In conclusion, childhood memories are a treasure trove that we carry with us throughout our journey. They are more than just moments; they are the building blocks of our identity, imprinted with emotions and experiences that shape us. As we navigate the complexities of adulthood, revisiting these memories allows us to reconnect with our roots and rediscover the child within us.

Explanation:
My childhood memories are a warm collection of small moments that shaped who I am. I remember dusty afternoons chasing friends through narrow lanes, the sound of laughter echoing off brick walls, and the taste of mangoes stolen from my neighbor’s tree. School mornings smelled of chalk and wet uniforms; my teacher's gentle patience made me curious. On rainy days, we jumped in puddles, feeling the cold splash on our feet while our mothers called from the doorways. Festivals meant colorful decorations, sweets, and the joy of sharing old stories around the table. My grandfather taught me how to fly a kite and how to repair its torn paper—he showed patience and resourcefulness that I still admire.

These memories are vivid not because they were grand, but because they were filled with feeling: the comfort of my mother’s hand, the thrill of a scraped knee, the pride of learning a new game. They taught me kindness, courage, and the value of simple pleasures. Looking back, I see how those small experiences formed my habits, my friendships, and my sense of belonging. Even now, a familiar smell or a simple melody can bring me back to those carefree days. Childhood memories are treasures that remind us where we came from and guide us toward who we want to become.

This composition works because it uses concrete sensory details and specific anecdotes to create vivid images, follows a clear structure (scenes then reflection), and ends with a reflective conclusion that links past experiences to present identity, making the piece coherent and emotionally engaging.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Composition (Duties and Responsibilities of Students)

Students, as the future pillars of society, bear significant duties and responsibilities that extend beyond academic pursuits. While education is a cornerstone of their growth, students also play a crucial role in shaping their character, contributing to their communities, and preparing for responsible citizenship. These duties and responsibilities serve as a foundation for personal development and positive societal impact.

First and foremost, students have a duty to prioritize their education. Attending classes regularly, actively participating in discussions, and dedicating time to study and research are essential aspects of fulfilling this duty. A strong academic foundation equips students with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in their chosen paths and contribute effectively to society.

In addition to academic commitments, students have a responsibility to cultivate virtues such as honesty, integrity, and empathy. Upholding these values not only benefits their own moral development but also fosters a culture of respect and ethical behavior within their communities. Furthermore, students must exhibit good behavior and discipline both within and outside the educational institution, serving as role models for their peers.

Students also have a duty to actively engage in co-curricular activities that enhance their holistic development. Participation in sports, arts, and cultural events nurtures creativity, teamwork, and leadership qualities. Moreover, involvement in community service projects fosters empathy and a sense of social responsibility, making students aware of the challenges faced by society and motivating them to contribute positively.

A significant responsibility of students is to respect the rights and diversity of others. Creating a harmonious and inclusive environment involves treating classmates, teachers, and staff with kindness and consideration. Embracing differences in opinions, cultures, and backgrounds fosters a spirit of tolerance and understanding, essential for a cohesive society.

As future citizens, students bear the responsibility of staying informed about societal issues and contributing to positive change. They must actively participate in civic activities, exercise their voting rights, and advocate for causes that align with their values. This engagement empowers them to play an active role in shaping the future of their nation.

In conclusion, the duties and responsibilities of students extend beyond the classroom, encompassing academic excellence, ethical conduct, personal development, community engagement, and societal contribution. By fulfilling these obligations, students not only pave the way for their own success but also contribute to the betterment of their communities and the progress of the nation as a whole.

Explanation:
This composition correctly meets the prompt by listing and explaining key duties and responsibilities of students—such as regular attendance, honest study, respect for teachers and peers, discipline, and participation in school life—and giving brief examples of how these habits support learning. It clarifies the underlying concept that duties are obligations one must fulfill while responsibilities are accountable actions that build character and communal harmony, both leading to personal growth and academic success. The clear introduction, organized body, and concise conclusion make the response easy to follow and ensure it satisfies the required length and purpose.

Question:
Internet is influencing our young generation both positively and negatively. Write composition on the ‘Uses and Abuses of Internet’. Write at last 200 words but don’t exceed 250 words.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Composition (Uses and Abuses of Internet)

The Internet, a revolutionary invention of the modern age, wields a profound impact on the younger generation, offering both immense benefits and potential pitfalls. Its positive influence is evident in various domains. As a treasure trove of information, the Internet serves as a vast repository of knowledge, enabling young individuals to explore diverse subjects, conduct research, and expand their horizons. Online educational platforms, tutorials, and e-books provide unparalleled learning opportunities, making education accessible to even the remotest corners of the world. Communication has also been revolutionized, as social media and instant messaging platforms foster connections, transcending geographical boundaries and enabling the exchange of ideas and cultures.

However, the Internet's allure also poses certain hazards. One of the most pressing concerns is the excessive screen time that can lead to addiction and a sedentary lifestyle, negatively impacting physical and mental health. The unfiltered nature of the online world exposes young minds to inappropriate content, promoting misinformation, cyberbullying, and online harassment. Privacy breaches and the vulnerability of personal data are serious threats as well. Moreover, the Internet's plethora of entertainment options can detract from real-world interactions and hinder the development of essential life skills.

To harness the Internet's potential while mitigating its drawbacks, a balanced approach is crucial. Educators and parents must guide youngsters in discerning reliable sources of information, practicing online etiquette, and maintaining a healthy screen time regimen. Schools should incorporate digital literacy education into curricula, teaching students critical thinking, digital citizenship, and online safety. Filtering software and parental controls can help shield children from inappropriate content.

In conclusion, the Internet is a double-edged sword for the younger generation. Its positive impact on education, communication, and global exposure is undeniable. However, its potential for misuse, addiction, and negative influence also looms large. Nurturing responsible online behavior, promoting digital literacy, and fostering a healthy balance between virtual and real-life experiences are pivotal in ensuring that our youth harness the Internet's benefits while safeguarding their well-being.
