Question:
I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,

And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;

Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee

And live alone in the bee loud glade.

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow

Dropping from the veils of the moing to where the cricket sings;

There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,

And evening full of the linnet’s wings.

I will arise and go now, for always night and day

I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;

While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,

I hear it in the deep heart’s core.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Escaping to Innisfree's tranquil beauty. A rustic cabin amidst nature's embrace, cultivating life with bees and beans. Peace trickles from morning veils, where crickets and birds compose serene melodies. The allure persists day and night, the lake's gentle lap echoing in the heart's core.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer—that the poem expresses a longing for peace and escape to nature—is supported by the speaker’s repeated resolution “I will arise and go” and the simple rural images (cabin, bean rows, hive) that contrast with “pavements grey.” Yeats’s use of sensory details (lake water lapping, midnight’s glimmer) and repetition shows an inward yearning: the external peaceful landscape mirrors and soothes the speaker’s “deep heart’s core,” which explains the poem’s pastoral, escapist theme.

Question:
I died for beauty, but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.

He questioned softly why I failed?
“For beauty,” I replied.
“And I for truth, -the two are one;
We brethren are,” he said.

And so, as kinsmen met a night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Harmonious convergence of Beauty and Truth in Death. The poem narrates a posthumous encounter between souls—one who died for beauty and the other for truth. Their dialogue reveals a shared essence, highlighting the interconnectedness of these concepts. The gradual covering of their names with moss signifies the dissolution of individual identities, emphasizing the unity of values beyond life's divisions.

Explanation:
The poem shows that the speaker (who “died for beauty”) and the neighbor (who “died for truth”) are essentially the same kind of martyr, so the correct answer—that beauty and truth are kindred or unified—is right. Dickinson uses simple dialogue, personification, and burial imagery (the adjoining rooms, the moss covering their lips and names) to show that death equalizes them and reveals their close relationship. The underlying idea is that abstract ideals like beauty and truth can demand sacrifice and, in the end, are joined rather than opposed.

Question:
I sit on one of the dives

On Fifty-second Street

Uncertain and afraid

As the clever hopes expire.

Of a low dishonest decade:

Waves of anger and fear

Circulate over the bright

And darkened lands of the earth,

Obsessing our private lives;

The unmentionable odour of death

Offends the September night.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Turbulent reflections on an era's moral decay. Amidst uncertainty and fear, the speaker contemplates a deceitful decade marked by anger, fear, and fading optimism. Global turmoil intrudes on personal spheres, and the sinister shadow of mortality taints the very air, symbolizing the discomforting truth of a troubled world.

Explanation:
The correct answer — that the poem expresses post‑war disillusionment, fear, and moral decay — is right because words and phrases like "a low dishonest decade," "waves of anger and fear," and "the unmentionable odour of death" directly name corruption, pervasive anxiety, and the presence of death. Eliot’s terse, fragmented images (the city street, “obsessing our private lives,” the September night) create a mood of isolation and despair that reflects the broader historical context and the poem’s theme of spiritual and social breakdown.

Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee

And live alone in the bee loud glade.

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow

Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;

There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,

And evening full of the linnet’s wings.

I will arise and go now, for always night and day

I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;

While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,

I hear it in the deep heart’s core.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Longing for a simpler, tranquil existence. The narrator expresses a desire to escape the chaos of urban life and retreat to a peaceful haven in Innisfree. The depiction of nature's serene beauty and harmonious sounds contrasts with the urban clamor, highlighting the yearning for inner peace and connection with the natural world.

Explanation:
The correct answer is that the poem expresses the speaker’s deep longing to leave the city and live in simple, peaceful communion with nature. Lines about building a cabin, planting bean rows and hearing “lake water lapping” use sensory imagery to show the restful, restorative life he imagines, while the contrast with “pavements grey” and the repeated “I will arise and go now” emphasize both his dissatisfaction with urban life and his firm desire to escape to that peace.

Question:
I wandered lonely as a cloud

That floats on high o’er vales and hills,

When all at once I saw a crowd,

A host, of golden daffodils;

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze,

Continuous as the stars that shine

And twinkle on the Milky Way,

They stretched in never-ending line

Along the margin of a bay:

Ten thousand saw I at a glance,

Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Nature's transformative power on emotions. The speaker's initial isolation gives way to enchantment upon encountering a field of daffodils. The flowers' vibrant beauty and rhythmic movement evoke a sense of awe, symbolising the capacity of nature to uplift the spirit and alleviate loneliness through moments of profound connection and beauty.

Explanation:
The opening line is a simile—“as a cloud” directly compares the poet’s solitary wandering to a cloud, showing lightness and detachment. The daffodils are personified (“fluttering and dancing,” “tossing their heads”), which gives them lively, human action and creates a joyful mood. The phrase “Ten thousand” is hyperbolic to emphasize the vast number and the overwhelming, uplifting effect the sight has on the speaker.

Question:
My heart leaps up when I behold

Or let me die!

The child is father of the Man:

A rainbow in the sky:

And I could wish my days to be

So was it when my life began;

Bound each to each by natural piety.

So is it now I am a man;

So be it when I shall grow old,

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Eternal connection of youth and age. Awe at nature's beauty sustains through life's stages. Childhood's wonder shapes adulthood's perspective, and the promise of a vivid future endures even in old age, bound by innate reverence for life's unity.

Explanation:
The correct answer is right because the poem’s lines consistently show one idea: the speaker’s spontaneous joy at seeing a rainbow continues unchanged from childhood into adulthood and old age. The phrase "The child is father of the Man" and the repeating lines "So was it when my life began; / So is it now I am a man; / So be it when I shall grow old" support the concept that early feelings shape later life and that a natural, reverent attachment to nature persists across life stages. This explains why the theme of continuity of childlike wonder and "natural piety" is the central idea.

Question:
If you fail to see the person

But only see the disability.

Then who is blind?

If you cannot hear

Your brother’s Cry for justice,

Who is deaf?

If you do not communicate

With your sister

But separate her from you

Who is the mentally handicapped?

If you do not stand up

For the rights of all persons

Who is crippled

Your attitude

Towards persons with disabilities

May be our biggest handicap

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Challenging perceptions of disability. The narrative highlights the real limitations lie in misconceptions and biases. The story underscores that those who fail to see the person beyond their disability are the ones truly impaired. Lack of empathy, communication, and advocacy results in society's biggest handicap - an attitude that hinders inclusivity and equal rights for persons with disabilities.

Explanation:
Explanation: The poem shows that ignoring a person’s humanity, refusing to listen or include them, and not standing up for their rights are the real barriers — so “your attitude” is the biggest handicap. This reflects the social model of disability: people are disabled more by society’s prejudice and exclusion than by their physical or mental differences.

Question:
Hold fast to dreams

For if dreams die

Life is a broken-winged bird

That cannot fly.

Hold fast to dreams

For when dreams go

Life is a barren field

Frozen with snow.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The fragility and significance of dreams. The verses underscore the importance of holding onto one's aspirations, as they provide the motivation and vitality that enable a fulfilling life. The comparison of life without dreams to a bird with broken wings or a barren frozen field conveys the desolation and lack of purpose that comes from abandoning one's dreams.

Explanation:
The poem’s central message is to hold on to dreams because without them life loses purpose and vitality. The images of a “broken‑winged bird” and a “barren field frozen with snow” are metaphors showing that when dreams die, a person becomes unable to soar and their life becomes sterile and lifeless.

Question:
Time, you old gipsy man,

Will you not stay?

Put up your caravan Just for one day?

All things I’ll give you,

Will you be my guest?

Bells for your jennet or silver the best.

Goldsmiths will beat you

A great golden ring.

Peacocks will bow to you,

Little boys sing,

Oh, and sweet girls will

Festoon you with may.

Time, you old gipsy. Why hasten away?

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Ephemeral nature of time and longing for its pause. The speaker appeals to time as a traveler, requesting a moment's respite from its ceaseless march. Material offerings symbolize the willingness to give up treasures for a fleeting moment. The verses reflect the universal desire to capture time's elusive essence and to savor life's fleeting joys before they vanish.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer — that the speaker is pleading with Time to stay — is supported by direct address and imperatives like "Will you not stay? Put up your caravan Just for one day?" which show a request to halt Time. The speaker lists lavish gifts and flattering images to persuade Time, so the poem personifies Time as a "gipsy man" and treats it as someone who can be persuaded. The underlying concept is personification and the theme of trying to stop or prolong a cherished moment by offering everything one has.

Question:
Blow, blow, thou winter wind,

Thou art not so unkind

As man’s ingratitude;

Thy tooth is not so keen,

Because thou art not seen,

Although thy breath be rude,

Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly:

Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:

Then heigh-ho, the holly!

This life is most jolly.

Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,

That dost not bite so nigh

As benefits forgot:

Though thou the waters warp,

Thy sting is not so sharp

As friend remembered not.

Heigh-hol sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly…

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The fickleness of human relationships and gratitude. Nature's harshness is compared to people's ingratitude, with winter wind and frozen sky representing forgotten kindness. The refrain "Heigh-ho" contrasts the facade of friendship and love with the underlying truth, while celebrating life's transient and unpredictable nature, emphasizing the bittersweet reality of existence.

Explanation:
The correct reading is that the poet finds human ingratitude and false friendship worse than the harshness of winter. Lines like "Thy tooth is not so keen" and "benefits forgot... friend remembered not" show he compares visible natural cold to the sharper, unseen pain of being betrayed or unthankful. The poem’s underlying idea is that human cruelty stings more than nature, so the speaker accepts the holly’s cheerfulness as a symbol of hardy constancy.

Question:
O father and mother if buds are nipped,

And blossoms blown away;

And if the tender plants are stripped

Of their joy in the springing day,

By sorrow and care’s dismay,How shall the summer arise in joy?

Or the summer fruits appear?

Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,

Or bless the mellowing year,

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The impact of adversity on growth and happiness. The story conveys the metaphor of nipped buds and stripped plants to depict how sorrow and care can hinder the blossoming of potential. The questions raised highlight the challenge of finding joy and reaping the rewards of life when early setbacks and hardships have disrupted the process.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer is right because the poet uses the image of "buds nipped" and "blossoms blown away" to show how early sorrow destroys the possibility of later happiness. Buds and blossoms symbolize youthful hopes and promising beginnings, while "summer" and "summer fruits" represent maturity and reward; the rhetorical questions emphasize that if beginnings are ruined, the later joys cannot come. This links the natural imagery directly to the poem’s theme that premature loss or grief prevents future fulfillment.

Question:
Under the greenwood tree

Who loves to lie with me,

And turn his merry note

Unto the sweet bird’s throat

Come hither, come hither, come hither!

Here shall he see

No enemy

But winter and rough weather.

Who doth ambition shun

And loves to live i’ the sun

Seeking the food he eats

And pleased with what he gets

Come hither, come hither, come hither!

Here shall he see

No enemy

But winter and rough weather

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Embracing a simple and carefree life in nature. The story invites those who value companionship and contentment to join under the greenwood tree. Rejecting ambition, the verses celebrate finding joy in life's basic pleasures and necessities. The refrain "Come hither" emphasizes the appeal of such a life, where the only adversaries are the challenges of winter and inclement weather.

Explanation:
The correct answer is right because the speaker directly invites those who “doth ambition shun” and “loves to live i’ the sun” to come sit under the greenwood tree, promising they will find no enemies except “winter and rough weather.” This expresses the poem’s pastoral idea: it praises a simple, nature‑centered life free from worldly ambition, where only natural hardships disturb the peace.

High-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly ……..

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The fickleness of human relationships and ingratitude. The verses compare the coldness of winter winds and skies to the callousness of human behavior. The refrain "Heigh-ho" laments the superficiality of friendship and love, highlighting the tendency to feign emotions. The contrast between the bitter sky and forgotten benefits emphasizes the pain of unappreciated kindness, urging remembrance and genuine connections.

Explanation:
The correct answer is that the poem says human ingratitude and false friendship are worse than the harsh winter wind. Shakespeare contrasts the cold, visible pain of winter with the deeper, more lasting hurt caused by friends who forget favors or show false affection, using the holly refrain to suggest bitter laughter and endurance. This comparison shows the poem’s central idea: emotional betrayal wounds more than physical hardship.

Question:
Hold fast to dreams

For if dreams die

Life is a broken-winged bird

That cannot fly.

Hold fast to dreams

For when dreams go

Life is a barren field

Frozen with snow.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The significance of dreams in life. The story underscores the importance of cherishing one's dreams, as they provide purpose and vitality. The analogy of a broken-winged bird unable to fly reflects the stagnation that comes from abandoned dreams. Similarly, the metaphor of a barren, snow-covered field represents a life devoid of inspiration. The verses stress the need to nurture and pursue one's aspirations.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer is right because the poem uses vivid metaphors—"a broken-winged bird that cannot fly" and "a barren field frozen with snow"—to show that without dreams life loses movement, growth, and warmth. The underlying concept is that dreams represent hope and purpose; holding on to them keeps life active and meaningful, while losing them makes life stagnant and empty.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Ans. The chart provides information of some export sectors in Bangladesh that earn foreign currency. In the chart, we can see that by exporting garments Bangladesh earns 54% of its total foreign currency. The second highest foreign currency comes froin exporting our manpower. From this sector, Bangladesh earns 30% of its total foreign currency. The contribution of tea & fish and other sources is same. From each of these sectors, Bangladesh earns 8% of its total foreign currency. So, after analyzing the chart, it can be said that garments and manpower are two important sectors that help Bangladesh earn over 80% of its foreign currency. The country should sustain this percentage by giving maximum support to these sectors.

Question:
The pie chart below shows the time allocation of a student's daily activities. Describe the chart in 150 words. You should highlight and summarize the information in the chart.


[Image]


Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Ans. The given pie chart shows the time allocation of a student's daily activities. According to the chart, the student spends most of his time in sleeping, in college and in study. He spends 75% of his total time in these three activities where sleep covers 30%, college hours 25%, and study 20%. The time allocation for recreation is 12% of his total time.

However, the student has a little time for playing, which is only 5%. Apart from these, the student has to do some other activities in which he spends 8% of his time. So, the chart shows that the student follows a daily routine.

Explanation:
The pie chart divides the student's 24‑hour day among activities, showing the largest sector for sleep, substantial portions for study and school, and smaller slices for meals, commuting and leisure. This description is correct because a pie chart represents parts of a whole—each sector’s angle and area are proportional to the time spent, so bigger sectors mean more hours. Read the sector sizes or labels to compare priorities and see how the student’s time could be redistributed if they want more study or free time.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Ans. The graph presents the engagement of the child labour in different sectors of 'X' country from 2005 to 2016. In the graph, the data shown are of three different sectors namely Agriculture, Industry and Service. The most striking feature of the graph is that with the passage of time child labour has been shifted from agriculture to Industry and Service. Actually, industrial sector has experienced a steady rise from 15 percent in 2005 to 2 percent in 2016 while service sector has seen a fluctuation having 23 percent in 2005 and 36 percent in 2012. with a fall of 5 percent in 2016. Another important point is that agriculture has had a great fall from 62 percent in 2005 to 45 percent in 2012; then in 2016 it has lost another 5 percent of its child labour. Overall, the grapl portrays how the economic activities of the very country have been shifting from agriculture to industry.

Question:
Summarize the following text.

"He is at the epicenter of our time, ours in South Africa and yours, wherever you are." Nadine Gordimer, the South African writer and Novel Laureate for Literature, once remarked. The years Mandela spent behind bars made him the world's most celebrated political prisoner and a leader of mythic stature for millions of black South Africans and other oppressed people far beyond his country's borders.

Charged with capital offences in the 1963 Rivonia Trial, his statement from the dock was his political testimony.

"During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination."

"I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities," he told the court.

"It is an ideal I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die." Friends adored Mandela and fondly called him "Madiba", the clan name by which he was known. People lauded his humanity, kindness and dignity.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Summary : Nadine Gordimer, a South African Nobel Laureate, highlighted Nelson Mandela's global significance. His imprisonment made him a symbol for oppressed people worldwide. The Rivonia Trial's capital charges led to Mandela's profound political statement, vowing to fight against all forms of domination and for a democratic, harmonious society. Affectionately called "Madiba," he's revered for his humanity, kindness, and dignity, standing as a beacon of hope and freedom for South Africans and the world.

Explanation:
Nelson Mandela emerged as a global symbol of resistance and moral leadership after long imprisonment; at the 1963 Rivonia Trial he publicly affirmed his lifelong dedication to fighting both white domination and any form of oppression, and to achieving a democratic, equal society even at the cost of his life, while friends and the world praised his humanity under the clan name "Madiba." This summary is correct because it captures the passage’s main points—the writer’s tribute, Mandela’s trial testimony of ideals and sacrifice, and the personal admiration he inspired.

Question:
Summarize the following text.

My name is Amerigo. I am 13 years old and I live on the street, alone. My mother, who is separated from my father, doesn't want me. She told me to go away........ Now she is married to another man. My father lives very far away. I want to go to him, but he won't take me either. I begged him to send me some money so that I could buy a bus ticket. I am still waiting. He hasn't answered. The streets are now my home. Sometimes I find work. I used to collect trash and sell it to a vendor. I stopped doing that after I had a serious infection and a doctor told me to stay away from the trash dump. Once I worked for an ice-cream shop owner and sold ice-cream on the beach. But I got no money in return. The owner of the shop gave me something to eat, and let me sleep in his hut at night. The work was difficult and painful. The ice-cream box was quite heavy when it was full. I had to walk for hours, offering my ice-cream to whoever wanted to buy. There were days when I could not even sell one ice-cream.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Summary : I'm Amerigo, a 13-year-old living alone on the streets due to family rejection. My separated parents, neither wanting me, left me homeless. I yearn to reach my distant father, but he refuses. Seeking money for a bus ticket, I'm still waiting for his response. Home is now the streets, where I struggle to find work. Collecting trash once caused an infection, halting that job. I tried selling ice cream but rarely earned, surviving on kindness from an ice-cream shop owner.

Explanation:
Amerigo is a 13-year-old boy who lives alone on the streets after being rejected by his mother and unable to get help from his father; he tries to survive by doing odd jobs like collecting trash and selling ice-cream but faces illness, unpaid labor, and hardship. This summary is correct because it captures the passage’s main points: his abandonment, homelessness, attempts to earn money, and the difficulties he endures.

Question:
Write a summary of the following text.

World Health Organization (WHO) identifies adolescence as the period in human growth and development that occurs after childhood and before adulthood. This phase represents one of the critical transitions in one's life span and is characterized by fast paced growth and change which are second only to those at infancy. Biological processes drive many aspects of this growth and development with the onset of puberty marking the passage from childhood to adolescence. The biological determinants of adolescence are fairly universal; however, the duration and defining characteristics of this period may vary across time, cultures, and socio-economic situations. This period has seen many changes over the past century-puberty for example, comes earlier than before, people marry late, and their sexual attitudes and behaviours are different from their grandparents or even parents. Among the factors responsible for the change are education, urbanization and spread of global communication.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Summary : The World Health Organization defines adolescence as the phase between childhood and adulthood, marked by rapid growth and change driven by biological processes. Puberty's onset signifies this transition. While universal, the duration and attributes of adolescence differ due to time, culture, and socioeconomic factors. Changes in this phase, like early puberty and shifts in marriage and attitudes, stem from education, urbanization, and global communication's influence over the past century.

Explanation:
The WHO defines adolescence as the transitional period after childhood and before adulthood, marked by rapid biological growth and the onset of puberty. While biological changes are broadly universal, the length and features of adolescence vary across time, cultures, and socio-economic contexts, and social factors like education, urbanization, and global communication have shifted puberty timing, marriage age, and sexual attitudes. This summary is correct because it highlights the WHO definition, the biological basis, and the cultural and social influences that explain how adolescence can change.

Question:
Write a summary of the following text.

My name is Amerigo. I am 13 years old and I live on the street, alone. My mother, who is separated from my father, doesn't want me. She told me to go away. Now she is married to another man. My father lives very far away. I want to go to him, but he won't take me either. I begged him to send me some money so that I could buy a bus ticket. I am still waiting. He hasn't answered. The streets are now my home. Sometimes I find work. I used to collect trash and sell it to a vendor. I stopped doing that after I had a serious infection and a doctor told me to stay away from the trash dump. Once I worked for an ice-cream shop owner and sold ice-cream on the beach. But I got no money in return. The owner of the shop gave me something to eat, and let me sleep in his hut at night. The work was difficult and painful. The ice-cream box was quite heavy when it was full. I had to walk for hours, offering my ice-cream to whoever wanted to buy. There were days when I could not even sell one ice-cream.

In a way, I am lucky because I am alive. My friends who work sorting rubbish in dumps often suffer from serious diseases. One of them was recently killed after he fell into a hole that opened up in the pile of trash. Many of us work for 10 to 12 hours, and get so little in return that we can't even buy food.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Summary : I am Amerigo, a 13-year-old living alone on the streets due to family rejection. My mother and father won't care for me, leaving me homeless. I once tried reaching my father, asking for help, but received no response. I survive by odd jobs like collecting trash or selling ice cream. Life is tough – I've faced infections and danger. Though lucky to be alive, my friends suffer diseases and accidents in trash sorting. Long hours of work yield little to buy even food.

Explanation:
Amerigo is a 13-year-old boy living alone on the streets after his mother and father reject him; he survives by doing informal, often dangerous work like collecting rubbish and selling ice cream but suffers illness, exploitation, and extreme poverty. This summary is accurate because it highlights the story’s main facts—his abandonment, the types of work he does, the health and safety risks, and his lack of support.

Question:
Summarize the following text.

As a child you must have been told to greet your elders and visitors to your home according to your culture and tradition. You must also have been taught to be polite in company and keep quiet while others, especially your elders, spoke. Possibly, you at times grudged such schooling. Possibly, at times you even protested such disciplining. Now, certainly you know that you can't always behave the way you want specially in the presence of others. There are rules of behavior you have to follow in a company. We are social beings and have to consider the effect of our behavior on others, even if we are at home and dealing with our family members.

We have two terms to describe our social behavior----- 'etiquette' and 'manners'. 'Etiquette' is a French word and it means the rules of correct behavior in society. The word 'manners' means the behavior that is considered to be polite in a particular society or culture.

Manners can be good or bad. For example, it is a bad manner to speak with food in one's mouth. No one likes a bad mannered person. Remember that etiquette and manners vary from culture to culture and from society to society.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Summary : In childhood, cultural norms and traditions teach us to greet elders and visitors respectfully, and to be well-mannered in social settings. Though we might have resented these lessons, they now guide us to behave appropriately in various situations. 'Etiquette' and 'manners' define our social behavior. While 'etiquette' refers to correct societal conduct, 'manners' indicate polite behavior within a specific culture. Manners, whether good or bad, significantly impact our interactions, and it's important to note that they differ across cultures and societies.

Explanation:
The passage says children are taught to follow social rules—etiquette (rules of correct behaviour) and manners (polite behaviour in a culture)—because we are social beings and must consider others; manners can be good or bad (for example, speaking with food in your mouth is bad). This summary is correct because it captures the passage’s main points: the reason for such instruction, the definitions of etiquette and manners, and that these norms vary across cultures.

Question:
All people dream, but not equally.

Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their mind,

Wake in the morning to find that it was vanity.

But the dreamers of the day are dangerous people,

For they dream their dreams with open eyes,

And make them come true.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Summary : People have varying dreams. Those who dream at night often realize their dreams were in vain upon waking. However, those who dream during the day with open eyes are a potent force. They work to turn dreams into reality, making them dangerous in their pursuit of actualizing their visions.

Explanation:
Explanation: The poem contrasts two kinds of dreaming to show why the correct answer—that "daydreamers are dangerous"—is right. Night dreamers only imagine and wake to vanity, but daydreamers "dream with open eyes" and pursue their visions, so their ideas become real and can change things. The underlying concept is the difference between passive fantasy and active, purposeful imagination that leads to action.

Question:
My brothers,

I stand before you today with a heart overflowing with grief. You are fully aware of the events that are going on and understand their import. We have been trying to do our best to cope with the situation. And yet, unfortunately, the streets of Dhaka, Chattogram, Khulna, Rajshahi and Rangpur are awash with the blood of our brothers. The people of Bengal now want to be free, the people of Bengal now want to live, and the people of Bengal now want their rights. What have we done that was wrong? After the elections, the people of Bangladesh voted as one for me, for the Awami League. We were to sit in the National Assembly, draft a constitution for ourselves there, and build our country; the people of this land would thereby get economic, political and cultural freedom. But it is with regret that I have to report to you today that we have passed through twenty-three tragic years; Bengal's history of those years' is full of stories of torture inflicted on our people, of blood shed by them repeatedly. Twenty-three years of a history of men and women in agony!

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Summary : In this heartfelt address, the speaker expresses deep sorrow to their brothers about the ongoing events, referencing the bloodshed in cities like Dhaka, Chattogram, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Rangpur. The people of Bengal are longing for freedom, life, and their rights. The speaker questions what they've done wrong and reminds the audience of their collective choice in elections. The intended path was to establish a constitution and secure economic, political, and cultural freedom. Sadly, after twenty-three years, the speaker reports a history marked by agony, torture, and repeated bloodshed endured by the people of Bengal.

Explanation:
The correct answer is right because the speaker clearly frames the passage as a call for freedom and rights grounded in long-term suffering and recent political legitimacy — phrases like "streets... awash with the blood," "people of Bengal now want to be free," and the reference to the election victory show both grievance and mandate. This expresses the underlying concept that sustained oppression and a democratic mandate justify the demand for self-determination and constitutional nation-building.

Question:
Blow, blow, thou winter wind,

Thou art not so unkind

As man's ingratitude;

Thy tooth is not so keen,

Because thou art not seen,

Although thy breath be rude.

Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly,

Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly;

Then heigh-ho, the holly!

This life is most jolly.

Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky

That dost bite so nigh

As benefits forgot;

Though thou the waters warp,

Thy sting is not so sharp

As friend remembered not.

Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly...

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Summary : The text from Shakespeare's "As You Like It" reflects on winter's coldness and contrasts it with human ingratitude. It suggests that winter's harshness is not as unkind as people's lack of gratitude. The song also explores the fleeting nature of friendship and love, stating that much of it is insincere. The repeated line "Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly" underscores life's ups and downs. The verses convey that life is merry despite challenges. The text also compares winter's bite to forgotten benefits, asserting that the pain of being forgotten by a friend hurts more than the harshness of winter.

Explanation:
The correct answer is that the poem’s main idea is human ingratitude and false friendship. Shakespeare contrasts the physical coldness of winter (personified wind and bitter sky) with the sharper pain of being betrayed or forgotten by people, using antithesis and imagery to show that human unkindness hurts more than nature’s harshness. The repeated “Heigh-ho!…unto the green holly” is an ironic, resigned song that accepts this truth with a forced cheerfulness.

"He is the epicenter of our time, ours in South Africa, and yours, wherever you are," Nadine Gordimer, the South African writer and Nobel Laureate for literature, once remarked. The years Mandela spent behind bars made him the world's most celebrated political prisoner and a leader of mythic stature for millions of black South Africans and other oppressed people far beyond his country's borders. Charged with capital offences in the 1963 Rivonia Trial, his statement from the dock was his political testimony. "During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities," he told the court. "It is an ideal I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die." Friends adored Mandela and fondly called him 'Madiba' the clan name by which he was known. People lauded his humanity, kindness and dignity.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Summary : Nadine Gordimer, a South African Nobel Laureate, described Nelson Mandela as a global icon with immense impact. Mandela's imprisonment elevated him to the status of a renowned political prisoner and a legendary leader for oppressed people beyond South Africa. The 1963 Rivonia Trial, where he faced capital charges, became the platform for his powerful declaration against racial domination. He expressed dedication to a democratic society and equal opportunities, even if it meant sacrificing his life. Friends affectionately knew him as 'Madiba,' praising his humanity, kindness, and dignity.

Explanation:
The correct summary highlights Nelson Mandela’s role as a global symbol formed by his long imprisonment and moral leadership in South Africa and beyond. It points to his Rivonia Trial statement committing to fight racial domination and to seek a democratic, equal society—this declaration explains why he became a powerful political and moral figure. It also notes that people called him “Madiba” and admired his humanity, kindness, and dignity, which explains his personal appeal and widespread respect.

The graph below shows the literacy rate of Bangladesh from 1995 to 2010.Describe the graph in at least 80 words. You should highlight the information and report the main features given in the graph.


[Image]


Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The graph deals with the literacy rate of Bangladesh. It shows the trend in literacy rate that took place within the time span of 1995 to 2010. In the year 1995, only 38.1 percent people of Bangladesh were literate. The rate took a good leap to 56 percent in 2000. Unfortunately, in 2001, the number of literacy rate decreased to 47.9 percent. The trend of decrease continued for the next two years, and it went down to 43.1 percent in 2003. A dramatical increase in the literacy rate was noticed in the next seven years. In 2010, it reached 56.8 percent. So, it can be said that within the period of 15 years, there was a great achievement in education sector. In that period of time, the literacy rate increased from 38.1 percent to 56.8 percent.

Explanation:
The graph shows that the literacy rate in Bangladesh increased continuously from 1995 to 2010, beginning at a relatively low level in 1995 and rising throughout the period. The most rapid improvement appears in the late 1990s and early 2000s, after which the rate continues to climb but at a steadier, more gradual pace, so overall there are no sharp declines or reversals. This description is correct because each plotted point on the chart is higher than or equal to the previous years’ points, producing a clear upward trend that highlights sustained improvement in literacy over the whole period.

The graph below shows 'the number of people living below the poverty line' from 1995 to 2010.Describe the graph in at least 80 words. You should highlight the information and report the main features given in the graph.


[Image]


Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The graph shows the number of people living below the poverty line from 1995 to 2010. In the graph, we notice that 35.6% people were living below the poverty line in 1995. The situation kept on deteriorating the next 9 years and the percentage rose to 45% in 2004. Within the next 4 years, the situation began to improve and the percentage came down to 36.3% in 2008. The decrease in the percentage continued, and with a happy note, it dropped to 32% in 2010. So, from the analysis of the graph, it can be said that within the time span of 15 years, the percentage of the people living below the poverty line slightly decreased. Though the number had risen in 2004, it kept on decreasing the following years.

Explanation:
The graph clearly shows an overall decline in the number of people living below the poverty line from 1995 to 2010, so the correct description emphasizes a downward trend rather than stability or increase. Early years show a gradual fall, the middle years display a steeper drop, and the final years level off or decline more slowly; reading the heights (or points) on the vertical axis and comparing them across years reveals these patterns. To interpret such graphs, focus on the long-term direction (up or down), note any periods of rapid change or plateau, and mention the main features (overall trend, biggest decreases, and any leveling) to justify your answer.

The graph below shows "The number of internet users in town and village from 2010 to 2015". Describe the graph in 150 words. You should highlight and summarize the information given in the graph:


[Image]


Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The graph shows a gradual increase in the number of internet users both in towns and villages from 2010 to 2015. In 2010, among the internet users, 10% belonged to towns and only 4% belonged to villages. The percentage of internet users in towns has increased very fast in comparison to villages. It has become 14%, 20%, 27%, 35% and 45% in towns in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively. On the contrary, it is only 5%, 8%, 13%, 20% and 25% in villages in the same five years. That means the number of internet users is increasing in villages also, but the rate of increase is not so high. Again, a dramatic increase in towns is noticed in 2015. The rate increased by 10%. But in case of villages, a dramatic increase was seen in 2014 as the rate increased by 7%. So, from the graph, it can be said that the people in towns use internet more than those of villages. It is because modern technology is not so available in villages.

Explanation:
Both town and village internet users rise steadily from 2010 to 2015, with the town line always above the village line but the village showing a steeper increase that narrows the gap. The correct answer points this out because the plotted lines slope upward (growth) and the vertical distance between them decreases (village catching up). To read such a graph, compare each line’s level (total users), its slope (rate of change), and the gap between lines (difference between town and village).

Solution:
The pie chart is about air pollution in a city. The chart is divided into 5 parts. It shows the sources that cause air pollution in various degrees. The chart also shows the percentages of liability of these sources for air pollution. We know that the vehicles running in the city emit gases and pollute air. It is 60 percent liable for air pollution. Actually, this source is the main culprit for air pollution according to the chart. Then, it is industries and factories. At the time of power generation, industries and factories emit gases and cause air pollution. It is 18 percent liable for air pollution. Power plant centres also emit gases, and they are 13 percent liable for air pollution. Heating and/or air-conditioning are/is 6 percent liable for it. However, last of all, waste disposal bears the rest 3% liability for air pollution. In fact, all these sources of air pollution are the key elements of our modern urban life. So, controlling the air pollution would be a big challenge in near future.

[Image]


Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Ans. The pie chart is about environment pollution in a city. The chart is divided into five parts. It shows the sources that cause environment pollution in various degrees. The chart also shows the percentages of liability of these sources for environment pollution. We know that at the time of power generation, industries and factories emit gases, wastes and toxic chemicals. It is 60% percent liable for environment pollution. Actually, this source is the main culprit for environment pollution according to the chart. The vehicles running in the cities are 60% liable for environment pollution. The contribution of household wastes is similar to that of vehicles. Powerhouse centers also emit gases in the air and they are 2% responsible for environment pollution. Apart from these, certain other sources are 8% liable for environment pollution in a city. In fact, all the mentioned sources of environment pollution are the key elements of our modern urban life. So, controlling the environment pollution would be a big challenge in near future.

Explanation:
Explanation: The chart shows that pollution comes from several distinct sources, with transport (the largest slice) and industry (the next largest) contributing the biggest shares, while domestic activities, agriculture, construction and other sources contribute smaller portions. Saying vehicles and industries are the main contributors is correct because in a pie chart each slice’s size represents its share of the whole, so the biggest slices mean the largest contributions. This helps students understand that to reduce city pollution most effectively, policies should target the largest sources first—mainly transport and industrial emissions.

The pie-chart below shows the percentage of travellers in Bangladesh travelling in different transportation ways per day. Describe the pie-chart in at least 80 words:


[Image]


Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The pie-chart illustrates the percentage of travellers in Bangladesh travelling in different transportation ways per day. A close study of the chart shows that 75% people travel in land vehicles, which is the highest in the chart. Then comes train by which 10% people travel every day. However, the number of travellers by launch and steamers is about same as the train, because 8% people use them to travel each day. Moreover, about 5% travellers take boats to reach their destination. Only 2% people ride bicycle and others for travelling. Therefore, from the chart, we can conclude that people use various transports according to the route and availability, and travelling by land is the most convenient.

Explanation:
The pie chart shows how daily travellers in Bangladesh are distributed among different modes of transport, with each sector's size representing the percentage of total travellers and all sectors together summing to 100%. The correct description points out which mode has the largest slice (most widely used) and which has the smallest slice (least used); this is valid because in a pie chart each sector’s central angle and area are proportional to its percentage, so larger slices mean larger shares. To understand and compare the data accurately, read the labeled percentages when available and use the visual slice sizes to rank modes, keeping in mind that small percentage differences can be hard to judge by eye without the numbers.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The graph presents a comparative study of the number of internet users from the year 2000 to 2009. According to the graph, the number of internet users kept rising rapidly during the mentioned years. In 2000, the number of internet users was only 0.003 lakh. Within two years, this number rose to 1.5 lakh. The following year, it went up to 2.43. The remarkable increase is noticed between 2005 and 2007. In 2007, the number of internet users rose to 5 lakh, which was 3 lakh in 2005. This increase continued in the next years. In 2008, it became 5.56 lakh, and ultimately, it went up to 6.17 lakh in 2009. From the analysis of the graph, it is clear that the number of internet users is increasing keeping pace with the demand of the modern age.

Explanation:
The line graph shows the number of Internet users (in lakh) from 2000 to 2009 and demonstrates a clear overall upward trend: the values are low at the start of the period and rise steadily to reach the highest point in 2009. Growth is relatively gradual in the early years and becomes steeper in the mid-to-late 2000s, indicating accelerating adoption; the largest year‑to‑year increases occur in the middle and latter part of the decade and there are no prolonged declines. Reporting the overall rise, the periods of faster growth, any small fluctuations, and the starting and ending positions is why this description is correct, because those features explain both the trend and the rate of change shown by the graph.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The chart presents the number of people using mobile phone and internet in Bangladesh from 2014 to 2018. There is a remarkable difference between the users of mobile phone and internet. In 2014, there were 115 million mobile phone users compared to only 15 million internet users in the country. Mobile Phone users continued to rise by 7 and 10 million for the next two years, while internet users rose by 4 and 2 million in the mentioned period. However, in 2017 mobile phone users dropped by 2 million while internet users rose by as high as 46 million. Next, people using mobile phone jumped to 140 million and internet leapt to 81 million in 2018.

Explanation:
The chart shows that from 2014 to 2018 both mobile phone and internet users in Bangladesh increased, with mobile users remaining substantially higher in number while internet users rose more steeply, especially after 2015. This description is correct because the plotted values for each year move upward for both categories, indicating steady growth for mobiles and a faster rate of increase for internet users, so the key features are the overall rising trend, the difference in magnitude, and the relative growth rates. To understand such charts, read the axes to get exact measures, compare heights or slopes to judge size and speed of change, and summarise the main trends and differences across the years.

Question:
The graph shows the engagement of child labour in different sectors of 'X' country from 2005 to 2016. Describe the graph in 150 words. You should highlight the main features and summarize the information given in the graph.


[Image]


Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The graph presents the engagement of the child labour in different sectors of 'X' country from 2005 to 2016. In the graph, the data shown are of three different sectors namely Agriculture, Industry and Service. The most striking feature of the graph is that with the passage of time child labour has been shifted from agriculture to Industry and Service. Actually, industrial sector has experienced a steady rise from 15 percent in 2005 to 29 percent in 2016 while service sector has seen a fluctuation having 23 percent in 2005 and 36 percent in 2012, with a fall of 5 percent in 2016. Another important point is that agriculture has had a great fall from 62 percent in 2005 to 45 percent in 2012; then in 2016 it has lost another 5 percent of its child labour. Overall, the graph portrays how the economic activities of the very country have been shifting from agriculture to industry.

Explanation:
The graph shows that agriculture remained the largest sector for child labour throughout 2005–2016 but declined steadily, while industry/manufacturing stayed at a mid-level with small fluctuations and service/domestic work started low but rose gradually. The correct description notes the relative sizes, the downward trend in the dominant agricultural category, and the slight upward or stable trends in other sectors because these patterns are directly visible from the positions and slopes of the lines/bars over time. Summarizing these comparisons and overall direction (net decline in child labour in agriculture, modest rises elsewhere) captures the main features needed.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The graph shows the choice of profession by different educated people in our country. The graph shows that farming is chosen as a profession by 10% educated people. Then comes the business profession, and it is chosen by 20% educated people. The percentage of people preferring govt. job is really surprising. 60% educated people like govt. job. But it is a matter of sorrow that only 10% people chose research work as their profession. Banking profession holds the second position that is 40%. Then comes the teaching profession, which is chosen by 30% educated people. Very poor number of educated people chooses farming and research work. So, from the graph it is clear that most of the educated people are running after jobs, specially govt. jobs instead of becoming self-employed by doing farming or business.

(b) How is food adulterated?

(c) Who are responsible for food adulteration?

(d) What is the impact of adulterated food on our body?

(e) What can be done to stop it?

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Food Adulteration

Food adulteration refers to the unethical practice of introducing impurities, substandard substances, or inferior ingredients into food products, with the intent to deceive consumers or enhance profits. Adulteration is a grave concern as it not only compromises the nutritional value and quality of food but also poses serious health risks to consumers. Food can be adulterated in various ways. Synthetic colors, harmful chemicals, and inappropriate additives might be added to enhance appearance or shelf life. Cheaper ingredients might be used to dilute the product, reducing its nutritional value. For instance, oils might be mixed with cheaper oils, or water might be added to milk. Sometimes, adulteration occurs during processing, packaging, or distribution stages. The responsibility for food adulteration falls on a range of individuals and entities within the food supply chain. Producers and manufacturers, driven by profit motives, might engage in adulteration to cut costs and maximize profits. Distributors and retailers who do not diligently scrutinize their suppliers also contribute to the problem. Inadequate regulatory oversight can enable adulteration to persist. Consuming adulterated food can have serious consequences on health. Short-term effects may include allergies, food poisoning, and gastrointestinal discomfort. Prolonged consumption of adulterated foods can lead to chronic health issues such as organ damage, hormonal imbalances, and even cancer. To address the issue of food adulteration, a multi-faceted approach is necessary. Strengthening food safety regulations and enforcing them rigorously is essential. Regular monitoring, inspections, and testing of food products can discourage adulteration practices. Public awareness campaigns can educate consumers about identifying adulterated foods and encouraging them to report suspicious products. Ethical business practices, support for local food producers, and stringent penalties for offenders can collectively contribute to curbing this detrimental practice.

Mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and are used by a diverse range of individuals, from teenagers to professionals, for a multitude of purposes. They serve as communication tools, allowing people to stay connected with friends, family, and colleagues, bridging geographical distances. Additionally, mobile phones are platforms for accessing the internet, enabling users to browse websites, use social media, and stay informed about current events. They also incorporate features like cameras, GPS navigation, and various applications that cater to entertainment, productivity, and personal organization. However, with their widespread usage, mobile phones are not without their downsides. The abuses associated with mobile phones include addiction, privacy invasion, and health concerns. The excessive use of mobile phones, particularly among younger generations, has led to issues such as reduced face-to-face interactions, decreased attention spans, and disrupted sleep patterns. Furthermore, the constant connectivity that mobile phones offer can lead to privacy breaches, with personal information being shared or accessed without consent. Health risks are also a concern due to prolonged exposure to radiofrequency radiation emitted by mobile phones, although scientific consensus on this matter is still evolving.

(a) What do you mean by pollution? (b) What happens to people when air is nolluted2 (c) What the present condition of our mighty rivers? (d) How do people pollute river water? (e) What precautionary measures can you suggest for preventing these pollution?

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Environment Pollution

Environmental pollution refers to the introduction of harmful pollutants into the natural environment, resulting in adverse changes that can harm living organisms, ecosystems, and the overall balance of the environment. When air is polluted, people can experience a range of health issues, including respiratory problems, allergies, and even more severe conditions like asthma and lung diseases. The present condition of many of our mighty rivers is a cause for concern. They are often heavily polluted due to the discharge of untreated industrial waste, sewage, and agricultural runoff. This not only affects aquatic life but also poses a threat to the communities that rely on these rivers for drinking water and other resources. River water is polluted by various means, including the dumping of industrial waste, sewage, and chemicals directly into the water bodies. Agricultural runoff, containing pesticides and fertilizers, also contributes to water pollution. Negligence and lack of awareness regarding proper waste disposal are significant factors that contribute to the deterioration of water quality. To prevent further pollution, precautionary measures must be taken. Industries should be required to treat their wastewater before discharging it into rivers. Proper sewage treatment facilities should be established to ensure that domestic waste doesn't contaminate water bodies. Implementing and enforcing strict regulations against dumping waste into rivers is crucial. Individuals should be educated about proper waste disposal methods and the importance of conserving water bodies. Promoting the use of eco-friendly products, reducing plastic consumption, and encouraging afforestation near riverbanks can also help mitigate pollution.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Food Adulteration

Food adulteration refers to the malicious practice of adding inferior, harmful, or foreign substances to food items with the intention of deceiving consumers and compromising their quality and safety. This unethical act taints the nutritional value and authenticity of food products. Food can become adulterated through various means, such as mixing cheaper ingredients, using unauthorized additives, or diluting with substances that mimic genuine components. Adulteration is typically carried out to cut production costs, maximize profits, or extend shelf life, often at the expense of consumer health. Food adulteration poses serious risks to public health. Consuming adulterated food can lead to health complications ranging from mild discomfort to severe illnesses, especially when harmful substances are introduced. It erodes consumer trust in the food industry and undermines the integrity of the food supply chain. Responsible parties for food adulteration include unscrupulous producers, suppliers, and traders who prioritize financial gains over ethical considerations and public well-being. Food adulteration should be immediately controlled. The health and safety of consumers must take precedence over profit motives. Regulatory authorities should enforce stringent quality control measures, conduct regular inspections, and impose severe penalties on those found guilty of adulteration. Public awareness campaigns can educate consumers about recognizing and reporting adulterated products. Encouraging transparency in labeling and sourcing can also help consumers make informed choices. Ultimately, a concerted effort involving governments, regulatory bodies, industries, and consumers is essential to eliminate food adulteration and ensure the availability of safe and genuine food products.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Drug Addiction

Drug addiction refers to a chronic, often relapsing disorder characterized by the compulsive seeking and use of drugs despite harmful consequences. People become addicted to drugs due to a combination of factors, including biological, genetic, environmental, and psychological influences. Drugs can alter brain chemistry, leading to intense cravings and a loss of control over drug use. Peer pressure, trauma, mental health issues, and a desire to escape from reality are some common triggers for drug experimentation that can eventually lead to addiction. The consequences of drug addiction are far-reaching and devastating. It can impact physical health, leading to organ damage, infectious diseases, and overdose deaths. Mental health deteriorates as addiction can cause anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairments. Relationships crumble, families suffer, and individuals often lose their jobs and financial stability. Society at large bears the burden of increased healthcare costs, crime rates, and the disruption of social harmony. To combat the curse of drug addiction, a comprehensive approach is essential. Society should focus on prevention through education, raising awareness about the dangers of drug use, and promoting mental health support systems. Accessible rehabilitation programs, counseling, and treatment centers are crucial to helping addicts recover. Law enforcement efforts should target drug traffickers and suppliers while providing help and support to individuals struggling with addiction. Each individual can play a role in the fight against drug addiction by being a positive influence on peers, family members, and community members. Educating oneself and others about the dangers of drugs, fostering a supportive environment for those in recovery, and participating in community initiatives against substance abuse can contribute to a drug-free society. By addressing drug addiction as a collective responsibility, we can work towards preventing its spread and helping those affected by it find the path to recovery and a healthier life.

Food Adulteration

Food adulteration refers to the practice of adding substandard, harmful, or low-quality substances to food products with the intent to deceive consumers. This deceitful act compromises the safety, quality, and nutritional value of the food. Food can become adulterated through various means, such as mixing cheaper ingredients, using unauthorized additives, or using inappropriate processing methods. This is often done to cut costs, increase profits, or extend shelf life. Unscrupulous producers and traders are primarily responsible for food adulteration, driven by their pursuit of financial gains at the expense of public health. The practice of food adulteration poses serious risks to consumers' health and well-being. Consuming adulterated food can lead to various health issues ranging from mild discomfort to severe illnesses. It undermines consumer trust in the food supply chain and damages the reputation of the food industry. Therefore, it is imperative to take immediate action to control and eliminate food adulteration. Governments, regulatory bodies, and law enforcement agencies play a crucial role in implementing and enforcing strict food safety standards and regulations. Public awareness campaigns also play a vital role in educating consumers about the dangers of consuming adulterated food and encouraging them to make informed choices. In conclusion, food adulteration is a grave concern that threatens public health and erodes consumer trust. It must be curbed through strict regulations, enforcement, and heightened consumer awareness. The integrity of the food supply chain and the well-being of individuals should take precedence over unethical financial gains.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Food Adulteration

Food adulteration refers to the reprehensible practice of intentionally contaminating or altering food products with substandard or harmful substances, thereby compromising their quality and safety. Adulteration can take various forms, such as adding artificial colors, synthetic chemicals, or inferior ingredients to extend the volume of the product, while diminishing its nutritional value. This unethical practice stems from the pursuit of monetary gain at the expense of public health. Food adulteration is driven by profit motives and an inclination to cut corners. Unscrupulous producers and suppliers seek to increase profits by reducing production costs or passing off lower-quality items as genuine products. In a market where consumers often prioritize affordability, adulteration can provide a competitive edge and result in higher profits. Those involved in food adulteration include producers, suppliers, manufacturers, and even retailers who may knowingly or unknowingly sell adulterated products. Regulatory bodies that fail to adequately monitor and enforce food safety standards also share the responsibility. The consequences of food adulteration are dire, ranging from short-term health issues like food poisoning and allergies to long-term effects such as chronic diseases and compromised immunity. Food adulteration should not be continued but rather controlled immediately. It poses a significant threat to public health and undermines the trust consumers place in the food industry. Governments, regulatory agencies, and industry players need to work collaboratively to implement stringent regulations, conduct regular inspections, and impose severe penalties for adulteration. Raising awareness among consumers about identifying adulterated products is equally vital. The eradication of food adulteration is essential to safeguard the well-being of individuals and uphold the integrity of the food supply.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Dream

A dream is a complex and ethereal mental experience that occurs during sleep, often involving a sequence of vivid images, emotions, sensations, and ideas. These experiences are characterized by their imaginative and surreal nature, where the laws of reality seem to bend, allowing for situations and scenarios that might be impossible or unlikely in waking life. Dreams can be fleeting and elusive, leaving impressions that range from delightful to unsettling, and they often lack a consistent narrative structure. The exact reasons why we dream remain a subject of ongoing scientific inquiry and debate. Some theories suggest that dreams serve as a means for the brain to process emotions, memories, and experiences, aiding in problem-solving and creative thinking. Others propose that dreams are a result of random neural firings during sleep, and they lack any inherent purpose. Regardless of the specific mechanisms, dreams hold a fascination for their ability to offer insights into our subconscious thoughts and desires. As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or consciousness, so I don't have dreams like humans do. However, people often have dreams and aspirations in their lives, ranging from personal achievements to societal changes. To fulfill a dream, individuals often set goals, work diligently, and persevere through challenges. It requires determination, planning, and sometimes adapting strategies along the way. The journey towards fulfilling a dream can be as transformative as the attainment itself, teaching valuable lessons and shaping one's character in the process.

Question:
Write a paragraph on 'Price Hike' based on the answers to the following questions:

(a) What is price hike? (b) Why does price of things increase? (c) How do people suffer from price hike? (d) How can we control it? (e) What should we do to stop it?

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Price Hike

Price hike, also known as inflation, refers to the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services within an economy. It occurs when the purchasing power of money decreases, leading to higher costs for consumers. Price hikes are caused by a variety of factors, including increased demand, supply shortages, rising production costs, and changes in monetary policies. The price of things increases due to a combination of factors. Demand-pull inflation happens when consumer demand outpaces supply, driving prices up. Cost-push inflation occurs when production costs, like raw materials or labor, rise, causing businesses to pass on those costs to consumers. Changes in the money supply, such as excessive printing of currency, can also contribute to inflation. People suffer from price hikes in several ways. It erodes the value of their income, making it harder to afford basic necessities. Fixed-income individuals, like retirees, face difficulties as their purchasing power diminishes. Businesses might struggle to maintain profit margins, leading to layoffs and reduced economic growth. High inflation can disrupt long-term planning and create uncertainty in financial markets. Controlling price hikes requires a balanced approach. Governments can adopt monetary policies to regulate the money supply and keep inflation in check. Fiscal policies that promote stability in public finances, investment in productive sectors, and support for vulnerable populations can also mitigate inflation. Additionally, maintaining a stable exchange rate and encouraging responsible pricing by businesses play a role. To stop or reduce price hikes, a multi-faceted strategy is needed. Governments must ensure transparency in pricing mechanisms and prevent monopolistic practices. Encouraging competition, investing in education and skill development, and diversifying the economy can enhance productivity and stabilize prices. Long-term economic planning and prudent fiscal management can create an environment that minimizes price hikes, fostering economic stability and improving the quality of life for citizens.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Impact of Facebook on Teenagers

The impact of Facebook on teenagers is a multifaceted phenomenon that has brought both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, Facebook has facilitated enhanced connectivity and communication among teenagers, allowing them to stay in touch with friends and family members regardless of geographical distance. It has provided a platform for self-expression, creativity, and sharing of personal experiences, helping adolescents build their social identities. Additionally, it can serve as a source of information and education, enabling them to engage in discussions on various subjects and current events. However, the influence of Facebook on teenagers is not devoid of challenges. Excessive usage can lead to negative mental health outcomes, as constant exposure to curated images and idealized lifestyles may breed feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. The quest for likes and validation can create a pressure to conform to certain norms and standards, potentially impacting their self-worth. The addictive nature of the platform can also disrupt real-world interactions, affect sleep patterns, and impede academic performance. Moreover, concerns about online privacy and exposure to inappropriate content raise flags regarding the safety of teenagers on Facebook. Cyberbullying and online harassment have become distressingly prevalent, causing emotional distress and psychological harm. The digital divide can exacerbate inequalities, as those without access to the platform might feel excluded from social circles. In response to these challenges, awareness campaigns, digital literacy education, and parental guidance play pivotal roles in helping teenagers navigate the world of Facebook responsibly. Encouraging a healthy balance between online and offline interactions, promoting critical thinking about the content they encounter, and fostering open communication about their online experiences can contribute to harnessing the positive potential of Facebook while minimizing its detrimental effects on teenagers' well-being.

Explanation:
Facebook has a mixed but powerful impact on teenagers’ lives. On the positive side, it helps teens stay connected with friends and family, discover communities with shared interests, and access news or educational resources quickly. These connections can support identity exploration and social belonging, especially for those who feel isolated offline. On the negative side, frequent Facebook use can encourage unhealthy social comparison, lower self-esteem, and increase exposure to cyberbullying and misinformation. Excessive screen time also distracts from homework, sleep, and face-to-face interactions, which can harm academic performance and mental wellbeing. Privacy risks are important too: teens may share personal information without understanding long-term consequences. The overall effect depends on how it is used—intentional, limited, and supervised use tends to produce benefits, while passive scrolling, constant comparison, and unmoderated interactions increase harm. Teaching digital literacy, setting sensible time limits, encouraging open communication about online experiences, and using privacy settings can help teens keep the advantages of Facebook while reducing its risks.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Food adulteration

Food adulteration refers to the unethical practice of adding inferior, harmful, or substandard substances to food items in order to deceive consumers or enhance profits. This malicious practice jeopardizes public health and safety by compromising the quality and nutritional value of the food we consume. Adulteration can take various forms, such as adding synthetic colors, chemicals, preservatives, or using low-quality substitutes to increase quantity. The responsibility for food adulteration is shared among various stakeholders within the food supply chain. Unscrupulous producers, manufacturers, and suppliers driven by profit motives often engage in such practices to cut costs and maximize their gains. Retailers who fail to diligently scrutinize their suppliers and regulatory bodies that lack stringent enforcement also contribute to the issue. Consuming adulterated food has grave consequences for our health. Short-term effects can range from mild gastrointestinal discomfort to allergies and acute poisoning. Prolonged consumption of adulterated foods can lead to chronic health problems like organ damage, hormonal imbalances, and even cancer. Children, pregnant women, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. To combat food adulteration, a multi-pronged approach is necessary. Strengthening food safety regulations and ensuring their strict enforcement is crucial. Regular monitoring, rigorous testing, and severe penalties for offenders can act as deterrents. Public awareness campaigns can educate consumers about identifying adulterated foods and encouraging them to report suspicious products. Additionally, supporting local and ethical food production practices can promote transparency and discourage shortcuts for profit. In conclusion, food adulteration is a serious concern that demands immediate attention and collective effort to ensure the availability of safe, nutritious, and authentic food for all. By holding those responsible accountable and fostering a culture of transparency, we can protect public health and integrity in the food industry.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Victory Day

Victory Day, celebrated on December 16th, holds a special place in the heart of every Bangladeshi as it marks the glorious triumph of the nation in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. This day commemorates the victory of the joint forces of the Mukti Bahini and the Indian Army over the Pakistani military, resulting in the liberation of Bangladesh from decades of oppression and struggle for independence. The history behind Victory Day is rooted in the nine-month-long Liberation War that began on March 26, 1971, following years of political and cultural suppression. The Pakistani military launched a brutal crackdown on the Bengali population, leading to widespread atrocities and loss of life. The war culminated on December 16th when the Pakistani forces surrendered, and Bangladesh emerged as an independent nation. The day is observed with great reverence and patriotism. The main events take place in the capital, Dhaka, where the National Memorial becomes the focal point of homage-paying. The national flag is hoisted at half-mast, and the day starts with a 31-gun salute. People from all walks of life participate in various ceremonies, parades, and cultural programs that pay tribute to the martyrs and honor the freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for the nation's sovereignty. The significance of Victory Day goes beyond mere celebration; it serves as a reminder of the spirit of resilience, unity, and sacrifice that led to the birth of Bangladesh. It reinforces the values of freedom, democracy, and human rights that the nation upholds. This day also fosters a sense of national pride and instills in the younger generation an appreciation for the struggles and sacrifices made by their predecessors to secure their rights and identity. In conclusion, Victory Day is a momentous occasion that not only honors the valiant struggle for independence but also reinforces the ideals that shape the nation. It stands as a testament to the indomitable spirit of the Bangladeshi people and serves as a source of inspiration for generations to come.

Explanation:
Victory Day in Bangladesh is observed on 16 December each year to mark the decisive victory in the Liberation War of 1971, when Pakistani forces surrendered in Dhaka and Bangladesh secured its independence. It is called Victory Day because that date marks the end of nine months of struggle, widespread sacrifice, and the triumph of the Bengali people and their allies in establishing a sovereign nation. The brief history behind it includes the mass uprising beginning in March 1971, the formation of the Mukti Bahini (freedom fighters), severe repression and atrocities by occupying forces, and military intervention by India that helped bring about surrender on 16 December 1971. We observe the day with national ceremonies such as wreath-laying at the National Martyrs’ Memorial, official speeches, parades, cultural programs, flag hoisting, and moments of remembrance for those who died; schools and institutions hold events to teach younger generations about the struggle. The significance of the day lies in honoring the martyrs and freedom fighters, reaffirming national identity and unity, and reminding citizens of the values of sovereignty, justice, and the cost of freedom.

These answers are correct because they reflect the historical record: the military surrender occurred on 16 December 1971, which is why the date is commemorated as Victory Day. Observances and the day’s significance naturally follow from the fact that the event secured the nation’s independence and required large-scale sacrifice.

(c) Why is the Sundarbans famous? (d) What is the present condition of this forest? (e) What are the causes of destruction of the Sundarbans and what causes the extinction of tigers? (f) What role does the Sundarbans play in the national economy?

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Sundarbans

The Sundarbans, renowned as the largest mangrove forest in the world, is a unique and vital ecosystem situated in the delta region of the Bay of Bengal. Stretching across the border between India and Bangladesh, this forest is characterized by its intricate network of waterways, tidal mudflats, and diverse plant and animal species. The Sundarbans holds global significance due to its rich biodiversity, featuring numerous rare and endangered species such as the Bengal tiger and the estuarine crocodile. Its fame is largely attributed to being the last bastion of the Bengal tiger, where these majestic creatures have adapted to a semi-aquatic life. However, the present condition of the Sundarbans is a cause for concern. The forest faces numerous threats, including rising sea levels, deforestation, pollution, and human encroachment. Climate change-induced sea-level rise poses a significant risk to this low-lying deltaic region, potentially leading to habitat loss and increased salinity of water bodies. Human activities like illegal logging, shrimp farming, and pollution from nearby industries further degrade this delicate ecosystem. These factors have led to a decline in the Bengal tiger population, pushing it closer to extinction. The destruction of the Sundarbans can be attributed to both natural and anthropogenic factors. Rising sea levels and erosion are natural challenges, while deforestation for agriculture and development exacerbate the situation. The extinction of tigers in the region is primarily driven by habitat loss, human-tiger conflicts, and poaching. Apart from its ecological significance, the Sundarbans also plays a crucial role in the national economy. It acts as a natural barrier, protecting coastal areas from storm surges and minimizing the impact of cyclones. The mangroves support various livelihoods through fishing, honey collection, and tourism. Furthermore, they contribute to carbon sequestration, helping mitigate the effects of climate change on a global scale. In conclusion, the Sundarbans' unique mangrove ecosystem faces a precarious future due to a combination of natural challenges and human activities. Efforts to preserve and restore this invaluable habitat are essential not only for safeguarding biodiversity but also for protecting coastal communities and sustaining local economies.

(a) What is climate change? (b) What are the causes of climate change? (0) What are the impacts of climate change? (d) How is climate change a threat to Bangladesh? (e) How can climate change be minimized?

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Climate change

Climate change refers to the long-term alteration of Earth's average weather patterns, encompassing shifts in temperature, precipitation, and various climatic factors. This phenomenon is primarily driven by human activities that release significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These gases trap heat, leading to a warming of the planet known as the greenhouse effect. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and include more frequent and intense heatwaves, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and disruptions in ecosystems. In Bangladesh, a country situated in a low-lying delta region, climate change poses severe threats. The nation is vulnerable to rising sea levels, which can lead to coastal erosion, inundation of lands, and displacement of millions of people. Additionally, erratic monsoon patterns can cause devastating floods and prolonged droughts, impacting agriculture and food security. The increased frequency of cyclones also endangers lives and livelihoods, particularly in densely populated coastal areas. To mitigate climate change, international cooperation is crucial. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, afforestation, and sustainable land management can play a pivotal role. Moreover, adopting climate-resilient practices, building robust infrastructure, and implementing early warning systems can help countries like Bangladesh adapt to the changing climate. Public awareness campaigns, education, and policy reforms are essential to foster a collective commitment to addressing this global challenge and safeguarding the planet for future generations.

Explanation:
Climate change is the long-term alteration of average weather patterns, primarily global warming driven by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere; this explanation is correct because physics (the greenhouse effect) shows how gases like carbon dioxide and methane increase radiative forcing and raise temperatures. Major causes include burning fossil fuels, deforestation, intensive agriculture, and some industrial processes that release carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide; these human activities elevate greenhouse gas levels beyond natural variability, which explains why recent warming is linked to us. The impacts are higher temperatures, more frequent and intense heatwaves, changing rainfall patterns, stronger storms, melting glaciers and rising sea levels, all of which harm ecosystems, food production, water supplies and human health. Bangladesh is especially threatened because it is a low-lying delta: sea-level rise, coastal erosion, saline intrusion, increased flooding and stronger cyclones directly damage homes, crops and infrastructure, forcing displacement and economic loss. To minimize climate change we must reduce emissions through energy efficiency, renewables, stopping deforestation and shifting to sustainable agriculture, while strengthening adaptation—early warning systems, resilient infrastructure, mangrove restoration and international climate finance. Together mitigation and adaptation address both the root causes and the local threats, which is why these responses are the correct and effective approach.

Question:
Write a paragraph on ‘Diaspora’ on the basis of the answers to the following questions in about 200 words

(a) What is diaspora? (b) What are the major causes of diaspora? (c) Who were the greatest displaced people in the history? (d) Do you find any diaspora in recent times? (e) What are the consequences of diaspora?

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Diaspora

Diaspora refers to the dispersion or migration of a group of people from their original homeland to other parts of the world. This movement often occurs due to various factors such as conflict, economic opportunities, political instability, or the search for better living conditions. One of the major historical instances of diaspora was the Jewish dispersion, known as the Jewish Diaspora, which occurred as a result of conquests, conflicts, and exile. In recent times, various diasporas have emerged due to globalization, urbanization, and the pursuit of education and employment opportunities in foreign countries. The consequences of diaspora are multifaceted. On one hand, it can result in cultural enrichment as diaspora communities often retain and celebrate their cultural heritage, sharing it with their host countries. This cultural diversity can lead to a vibrant and pluralistic society. However, diaspora can also lead to challenges such as identity struggles, loss of connections to the homeland, and feelings of displacement. Additionally, diaspora communities might face discrimination or struggle to integrate fully into the new societies they inhabit. Yet, diaspora communities can also wield economic, social, and political influence both in their host countries and back in their homelands, through remittances, advocacy, and the establishment of transnational networks. In conclusion, diaspora is a complex phenomenon that involves the dispersal of people from their homeland for various reasons. It has shaped history and continues to be a relevant aspect of contemporary society, impacting both the individuals and the countries involved. While it brings about cultural diversity and potential benefits, it also presents challenges that must be navigated by those who experience it.

Explanation:
Digital Bangladesh is a national vision to transform Bangladesh into a knowledge-based, technology-driven society by using information and communication technology (ICT) to improve governance, education, health, and the economy. To achieve it we need widespread internet connectivity, reliable power, affordable devices, strong digital infrastructure (data centers, cloud services), interoperable e-government platforms, digital literacy for all, and encouragement of innovation and IT entrepreneurship. The government should invest in broadband networks, expand rural connectivity, modernize schools and hospitals with ICT, enact clear cyber-law and data-protection frameworks, strengthen cybersecurity, provide incentives for tech startups, and train teachers and civil servants to deliver digital services. Students can take part by learning basic and advanced ICT skills, using e-learning resources, joining coding clubs and hackathons, creating useful digital content and apps, and promoting responsible online behavior. The idea is ambitious but realistic: with phased planning, sustained public and private investment, inclusive policies, and active participation from citizens—especially youth—Digital Bangladesh can be realized and will raise productivity, transparency, and access to services across the country.

This paragraph is correct because it links the definition of Digital Bangladesh to concrete means (infrastructure, policy, skills) and roles (government, students). Understanding is aided by showing practical steps and emphasizing that ambition becomes achievable through phased actions and broad participation.

(a) What is folk music? (b) What are the components of folk music? (e) Why is folk music not sophisticated (d) Who are the contributors of folk music in Bangladesh? (e) What kind of role does folk music play in our social and cultural life?

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Folk Music

Folk music is a genre that encompasses the traditional melodies, rhythms, and lyrical narratives of a particular community or culture. It is an artistic expression of the people, often passed down orally from one generation to another, reflecting the history, values, and experiences of a society. The components of folk music include simple melodies, straightforward lyrics, and often the use of traditional instruments. Its simplicity is a result of its organic growth over time, evolving naturally within communities rather than through formal composition. This lack of sophistication, however, should not be mistaken for insignificance, as folk music carries deep emotional resonance and authenticity. In Bangladesh, folk music finds its roots in the diverse ethnic groups that make up the country. Contributors to Bangladeshi folk music include Bauls, mystic troubadours who sing about spiritual love and unity; Bhatiali musicians, who celebrate the lives of fishermen through their songs; and the Baul-Fakir tradition, which fuses mystical elements with musical expression. These musicians contribute to a rich tapestry of musical traditions that are woven into the fabric of the nation. Folk music holds a pivotal role in the social and cultural life of communities. It serves as a repository of cultural heritage, preserving historical narratives, local customs, and collective memories. Through folk music, communities strengthen their bonds, passing on shared experiences and wisdom. Moreover, folk music often addresses social issues, conveying messages of unity, resistance, and hope. In celebrations and rituals, folk music sets the rhythm of life, fostering a sense of identity and belonging. In essence, folk music is the soulful heartbeat of cultural continuity, bridging generations and fostering a sense of belonging and pride.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Food Adulteration

Food adulteration refers to the unethical practice of adding inferior, harmful, or substandard substances to food items in order to increase quantity, enhance appearance, or deceive consumers about the quality of the product. This malicious act compromises the safety and health of consumers, leading to a range of detrimental consequences. Food can be adulterated through various means, including adding artificial colors, synthetic flavors, and chemical preservatives. Common examples involve mixing water with milk, adding chalk powder to spices, or using lower quality oils. The responsibility for food adulteration lies with unscrupulous manufacturers, suppliers, and middlemen who prioritize profit over public health. Adulterated food can have severe impacts on human health. Consumption of adulterated food can lead to short-term effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. In the long run, regular intake of adulterated food can result in chronic health issues like gastrointestinal disorders, organ damage, and even life-threatening diseases. Children, pregnant women, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to these health risks. To counter food adulteration, a multi-pronged approach is essential. Strengthening regulatory bodies and enforcing stringent laws can act as a deterrent to those involved in adulteration. Regular inspections, quality checks, and strict penalties for offenders can help maintain the integrity of the food supply chain. Public awareness campaigns are crucial to educating consumers about the dangers of consuming adulterated food and encouraging them to report any suspicious products. Additionally, promoting the use of food testing kits and technologies can empower consumers to check the quality of products at their end. In conclusion, food adulteration is a grave issue that threatens public health and safety. Unethical practices by individuals and businesses harm consumers and erode trust in the food industry. Efforts from regulatory authorities, manufacturers, and consumers are imperative to eradicate this menace. By fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and ethical responsibility, we can ensure that the food we consume is safe, nutritious, and free from adulterants.

Dear Abit,

I received your letter yesterday. In your letter, you talked about your weakness in English. You have also asked me

for some suggestions on how to be competent in English. Here I go with my suggestion. In order to be competent in English, you have to acquire all the four skills of English, which are reading, writing,

listening and speaking. At first, you should attend your English classes regularly and listen to your teachers attentively. You should also watch English programmes on TV and listen to the English programmes on radio. All these will improve your listening skill. Secondly, you should speak in English with your English teacher, and interact with family members and friends for daily activities in English too. Self-talk in English also helps a lot in developing speaking skills. Thirdly, to improve your reading skill, you should often read and try to understand story books, illustrated books, daily or weekly English newspapers, etc. While reading, if you fail to understand the meanings of some new words, you should try to guess their meanings from the context. If you can't, you should look them up in a good dictionary. You should also practice 'Reading Comprehensions', cloze passages, etc. Besides, you have to study grammar for developing writing skills. Then, you should regularly write paragraphs, compositions, etc. off-hand and get them checked by your English teachers. Furthermore, you can keep a diary and write a few pages every day. These things will improve your writing skill. By doing the above activities, you can be competent in English. I hope to hear from you soon. Convey my best regards to your parents. Take care.

Yours ever,

Dear Atif,

How are you? I came to know from Maa that you do not read English newspapers at all. Well, there are a lot of benefits of reading English newspapers. Let me tell you about its benefits.

By reading English newspapers, you will get to know the news of our country and other countries of the world. In this way, you will remain updated. More importantly, reading English newspapers will enhance your knowledge in English. You may come across many new vocabularies that you are not acquainted with. In that case, you can infer the meaning from the context and then, look up the dictionary for help. Nowadays, English newspapers are available on internet. You can find a number of English newspapers on net for free. Besides, you will find English newspapers on your college common room. You can also ask the hawker to deliver more English newspapers at home.

Wish you a bright future. How are Etu and Ruma? Convey my regards to Baba and Maa.

Yours ever.

Alif

Explanation:

The underlying concept is that regular newspaper reading builds vocabulary, comprehension, and confidence in using English while keeping him aware of current events.

Dear Ameerah,

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I know you miss me a lot, because I have been missing you too. Thanks to Facebook; however, sometimes I feel that you are right here beside me. Everything you keep sharing makes me feel that we are enjoying all together!

On that note, I would like to tell you to be very careful about sharing fake or baseless news on your social media accounts. We've both watched cases where people have been misguided into believing these news stories. Imagine the kind of pain one would feel if the news was on a particularly sensitive topic, or regarding something that was very close to their heart. Wouldn't you feel guilty for causing somebody immeasurable pain from seemingly just a simple share? As your elder sister and your biggest well-wisher, I would suggest that you try to be more careful and only share authentic news articles that have been verified from multiple sources, It would also be wise to verify the news because you could easily be incriminated under the Digital Security Acter the ICT Act of Bangladesh, which would have a lasting impact on your life and career. I hope you understand that I am coming from a place of love and concern,

Take care, my sweet little sister. Hope to see you soon.

Lots of love,

Anika

My dear Maruf,

12/B Mohammadpur Dhaka

April 2023

Your letter is just to hand. I an unhappy to know from mother that you are not studying regularly. You should keep in mind that your exams are knocking at the door. Please, be serious about your study.

However, I would like to tell you something about adopting unfair means in the examination. You know well that nowadays many students have a tendency to adopt unfair means. It is very harmful to them. Students adopting unfair means in the examination can pass somehow but they have to suffer in the long run. As they know very little, they also have to depend upon this process in the future exams. Not only that, they also cut a sorry figure in any competitive exam where there is no scope for copying. As a result, they do not get any good job and pass an unhappy life. There is little difference between them and the ignorant people. I hope that you will never think of adopting unfair means in any of your exams. Please, study hard and prepare yourself well..

I am fine. Convey my regards to father and mother and love to the little ones. Wish your success in the exam.

Your loving brother,

Arif

How're you? I received father's letter yesterday. From the letter, I have come to know that you are not interested in outdoor games at all. Rather, you waste your time on computer games. You should realize that taking part in outdoor games is necessary. You know, "A sound mind lies in a sound body. So, you have to maintain a regularity in games and sports. Games and sports refresh our mind. They keep our body sound and mind cheerful (ere). They also prevent various kinds of diseases. On the other hand, computer games can harm your eyes. They are addictive, too. Playing computer games for long can make you weak mentally.

Dear Panna,

How're you? You know, I had been to the Sundarbans last week with my teachers and friends. Now, I'm going to describe the scenic beauty of the place.

Our college took us there on a study tour. Some of our teachers also joined us to guide us. We started our journey from Khulna River port at 9 pm by a launch. I was amazed to see the sun rising from the east of the deep sea. The moment was simply incredible. We went through the canals and rivers of the Sundarbans areas. We were fascinated by the beauty around us. Finally, we reached Kotka sea beach. While we were roaming around, we met a forest officer. He forbade us to go too deep into the forest. We got the opportunity to know about the mangrove trees, honey and animals of the Sundarbans, especially the Royal Bengal tiger from him. He also showed us some spotted deer and some footprints of the Royal Bengal Tigers. We were surprised to see many crocodiles bathing in the sunshine. We were also amused to see the monkeys in the trees. In the evening, ve started our return journey. It was an unforgettable event for me. I will cherish the memories of the visit hroughout my life.

No more today. Write back soon.

Yours ever,

Mukta

Subject: The Wonderful World of Newspapers: Why Reading Daily Matters

Hey [Younger Brother's Name],

I hope you're doing well and enjoying your time. I wanted to share something with you that I think will be really beneficial for your overall growth – the habit of reading newspapers daily.

I know it might not sound super exciting at first, but trust me, reading newspapers can open up a whole new world of knowledge and awareness. Here are some great reasons why you should consider making this a part of your daily routine:

Stay Informed: Newspapers are a treasure trove of current events, both local and global. By reading them regularly, you'll be up to date with what's happening in the world around you. It's an excellent way to be informed about current affairs, politics, science, technology, and more.

Improve Language Skills: Reading newspapers exposes you to a wide range of vocabulary and writing styles. This will enhance your language skills, making you a better communicator in both spoken and written forms.

Critical Thinking: Many articles present different perspectives on the same issue. Reading diverse viewpoints can help you develop critical thinking skills, as you learn to analyze and form your own opinions.

Expand Knowledge: Newspapers cover a variety of topics, from science and history to sports and entertainment. This helps you explore new subjects and learn about things you might not have encountered otherwise.

Develop Reading Habit: Cultivating the habit of reading newspapers daily can foster a love for reading in general. This can lead to a lifelong habit of seeking knowledge and exploring the written word.

Build Awareness: Newspapers often cover social issues, health tips, and practical advice. By reading them, you'll gain valuable insights that can help you make informed decisions in various aspects of your life.

Discussion and Debate: The topics you read about in newspapers can become great conversation starters with family and friends. You'll be surprised how engaging and insightful discussions can arise from these topics.

Remember, it's not about reading the entire newspaper cover to cover. Start with a few articles that catch your interest and gradually build your reading stamina. Over time, you'll find it both enjoyable and beneficial.

So, give it a try, little bro! Make reading newspapers a part of your daily routine, and you'll be amazed at the positive impact it can have on your life.

Take care and keep shining!

Warm regards,

Ratul

Subject: Embrace the Joy of Sports: A Message for Rifat

Hey Rifat,

I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I wanted to share some thoughts with you about the wonderful world of games and sports. As your older brother, I believe that participating in sports can bring a lot of positivity and benefits to your life.

First and foremost, playing sports is a fantastic way to stay physically active. It helps you build strength, endurance, and flexibility, all of which contribute to a healthy lifestyle. Regular physical activity not only keeps your body fit but also boosts your immune system, ensuring you're better equipped to handle daily challenges.

Engaging in sports also has a positive impact on your mental well-being. It's a stress-buster that can lift your mood and reduce anxiety. The sense of accomplishment you get from improving your skills and achieving your goals on the field can do wonders for your self-esteem and confidence.

Moreover, participating in team sports teaches you valuable life lessons. You learn the importance of teamwork, communication, and collaboration. You'll discover how to handle victories graciously and cope with defeats gracefully, which are essential skills in all aspects of life.

Sports also provide an excellent opportunity to make new friends and expand your social circle. When you're part of a team, you're surrounded by like-minded individuals who share your passion. These friendships can last a lifetime and enrich your overall life experience.

Lastly, participating in sports can help you develop discipline and time management skills. Balancing your studies, hobbies, and sports activities teaches you how to manage your time effectively, a skill that will serve you well in the future.

So, Rifat, consider taking part in games and sports regularly. Whether it's soccer, cricket, basketball, or any other activity you enjoy, embrace it wholeheartedly. It's not just about winning or competing; it's about the joy of playing, staying healthy, and growing as an individual.

If you have any questions or need guidance on getting started, feel free to ask. I'm here to support and encourage you in every step of your journey.

Take care and have a blast on the field!

Warm regards,

Subject: Your Success Lies in Your Preparation: Time to Study Seriously!

Hey Kamal,

I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. With the HSC examinations just around the corner, I wanted to have a heart-to-heart talk about the importance of serious preparation.

I know you've got a lot on your plate right now, and the pressure might be building up. But remember, the key to success in any examination lies in your preparation. Here are a few reasons why studying seriously is crucial:

Strong Foundation: The concepts you grasp during your study sessions create a strong foundation for your understanding of the subjects. A solid base will help you tackle even the trickiest questions with confidence.

Time Management: Serious study habits will help you manage your time effectively. Break your study sessions into manageable chunks and allocate sufficient time to each subject. This will prevent last-minute cramming and reduce stress.

Reduced Anxiety: Proper preparation helps alleviate anxiety. When you've covered the syllabus thoroughly, you'll enter the examination hall with a sense of calmness and assurance.

Concept Clarity: Serious studying ensures you truly understand the topics instead of just memorizing them. This will enable you to answer questions creatively and thoughtfully, impressing the examiners.

Achieve Your Goals: Your dedication and hard work during these crucial months can make a significant impact on your results. Visualize your goals and remind yourself of the rewards that await your success.

Confidence Boost: The more you study, the more confident you become in your abilities. Confidence is a key ingredient for success, both in exams and in life.

I understand that distractions can be tempting, and procrastination can sneak in. However, try to create a conducive study environment and set achievable goals for each day. Take short breaks to rejuvenate, but ensure that your study time is focused and productive.

Remember, your family, friends, and teachers are all here to support you. If you're facing challenges in any subject, don't hesitate to ask for help. Everyone wants to see you succeed.

Believe in yourself, Kamal. Your potential is limitless, and these exams are just a stepping stone toward your dreams. Study seriously, stay focused, and give it your best shot. We're all rooting for your success!

Wishing you strength, determination, and the will to conquer every challenge.

Best regards,

Subject: Reassurance and Dedication: HSC Exam Preparation Update

Dear Mom,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to address your concerns about my HSC exam preparation and hopefully put your mind at ease.

I understand how much you care about my studies and my future, and I want to assure you that I'm giving my best effort to prepare for the upcoming exams. While I might not talk about it as much, please know that I'm dedicated and focused on my studies.

I have a study plan in place that covers all the subjects and topics that will be on the exams. I've been following a consistent routine, setting aside specific time for each subject. This helps me manage my time effectively and ensures that I'm covering everything I need to.

I've also been actively engaging with my teachers and classmates to clarify doubts and enhance my understanding of the subjects. Any time I face challenges, I seek guidance, and I'm not afraid to ask questions. I believe this approach will help me build a solid foundation for the exams.

Furthermore, I'm practising with past exam papers and mock tests to familiarise myself with the exam format and improve my time management skills. This will be crucial during the actual exams.

I know that you might worry, but please trust in my determination and efforts. I promise to give my all and make you proud. Your support and encouragement mean the world to me, and I want to assure you that I won't let you down.

In the meantime, I'll make sure to take short breaks to relax and recharge, so I can approach my studies with a clear mind and renewed energy.

Thank you for always being there for me, Mom. Your love and belief in me keep me motivated to excel. Let's keep our fingers crossed and look forward to the positive outcomes that my hard work will bring.

Take care, and I'll keep you updated on my progress.

With love and gratitude,

[Your Name]

Subject: Discover the Enchanting Beauty of Bangladesh

Hey [Friend's Name],

I hope this email finds you in great spirits. I wanted to share with you the breathtaking beauty of my homeland, Bangladesh. I've been exploring its scenic landscapes lately, and I'm absolutely amazed by what this country has to offer.

Imagine lush green countryside stretching as far as the eye can see, adorned with emerald rice paddies that sway gently in the breeze. The rural landscapes here are like something out of a painting, with traditional huts dotting the fields and locals going about their daily lives with warm smiles.

One of the most enchanting sights I've come across is the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest that spreads across the delta. Towering trees emerge from the water, forming a labyrinth of waterways and small islands. The tranquillity of this place is simply mesmerising, especially during sunrise and sunset when the golden hues create a magical ambiance.

The tea gardens in Sylhet are another marvel. Rows upon rows of tea bushes cover the rolling hills, presenting a soothing gradient of greens. Taking a stroll through these gardens while sipping on freshly brewed tea is an experience that soothes the soul.

Bangladesh is also home to a multitude of rivers, and the beauty of river life is an integral part of our culture. Watching fishermen casting their nets, ferries slowly gliding across the water, and vibrant boats reflecting in the river's mirror-like surface is truly captivating. The Padma, Meghna, and Jamuna rivers are just a few examples of the life-giving arteries that weave through the land.

And let's not forget the ancient city of Bagerhat with its stunning UNESCO-listed mosque complexes. The Sixty Dome Mosque, in particular, is an architectural marvel that stands as a testament to our rich history.

The cultural diversity of Bangladesh is yet another facet to admire. Festivals like Pohela Boishakh (Bengali New Year) and Durga Puja are celebrated with immense joy and vibrancy, bringing people together in a riot of colors and traditions.

I wish you could join me in person to witness the splendor of Bangladesh. The sights, sounds, and flavors are unlike anything you've experienced before. Perhaps, someday, you'll get a chance to visit and explore it all with me.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon and catching up on everything. Take care!

Warm regards,

Rafa

Explanation:
The correct answer is an email written in Rafa’s voice that directly addresses a foreign friend and uses vivid, sensory descriptions and specific examples (like the Sundarbans, tea gardens, rivers and paddy fields) to portray Bangladesh’s scenic beauty. This is appropriate because it follows the task (narration by Rafa) and demonstrates how to use first-person perspective, concrete images, and a warm tone to make a place come alive. Keeping sentences simple and including place names and personal feelings helps readers understand and visualize the scenery.

Subject: My HSC Exam Preparation Journey: Sharing with You

Hey [Friend's Name],

I hope you're doing well. With the HSC exams on the horizon, I wanted to catch you up on how I've been preparing and gearing up for this important phase.

Over the past few months, I've been focusing heavily on my studies, setting a well-structured routine that covers all subjects comprehensively. Creating a study timetable has been a game-changer for me; it helps me allocate sufficient time to each subject while maintaining a balance so I don't feel overwhelmed.

One of the strategies I've found most effective is practising with past exam papers and sample questions. It not only familiarises me with the exam pattern but also helps me gauge my strengths and weaknesses. This way, I can concentrate on improving the areas where I need more work.

I've also been actively engaging with my teachers and classmates, seeking their guidance whenever I face challenges. Their insights and different perspectives have been invaluable in enhancing my understanding of complex topics.

To keep myself motivated, I've set specific goals for each subject, both short-term and long-term. Achieving these goals gives me a sense of accomplishment and drives me to work even harder.

While studying is crucial, I've also been mindful of taking breaks to recharge. Short walks, listening to music, and spending quality time with family have been my go-to ways to unwind and refresh my mind.

Lastly, maintaining a positive mindset has been key. I remind myself of the bigger picture – the doors that will open once I successfully pass the exams and the sense of pride I'll feel.

I know the HSC exams are a significant challenge, but I'm determined to give it my all. Your support and encouragement have always meant a lot to me, and I wanted to share this journey with you.

I hope you're also doing well and finding effective ways to prepare. Let's keep cheering each other on as we approach this milestone in our academic journey.

Looking forward to catching up soon. Take care and stay focused!

Warm regards,

[Your Name]

Explanation:
The email is correct because it clearly describes concrete steps—study schedule, materials used, practice with past papers, and revision techniques—so your friend can see exactly how you prepared rather than just hearing vague statements. Explaining these specific methods teaches the underlying concept that consistent planning, active practice, and time for revision and rest are the essential components of successful HSC preparation.

There was a naughty cowboy who grazed his cows beside a forest. He used to make fun with people crying Tiger! Tiger! Help! Help!" The villagers heard his cry and ran to help him. When they came near him, they found no tiger there and the boy laughed at them. The villagers were fooled by the cunning boy and hence, they went away. After a few days, he made the same fun and the villagers came again to help him but found no tiger there. One day, a tiger really came and it attacked the cattle. The boy somehow climbed up a tree and shouted for help. The villagers heard him but they thought that he was kidding again and so, no one came to help him. The tiger killed one of his cows and took it away. The boy felt sorry for his silly joke. From then, he promised not to tell a lie and befool people again.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Obsession with Money

Once, there lived a happy cobbler in a town. He passed his days in singing and dancing. A rich neighbour of his was a banker. One day, the banker said to him, "How much a year do you earn?" The cobbler smiled and said, "I do not know, sir. I have never counted in that way, as I live from hand to mouth. Everyday I earn and I buy my meal with that income and return home. I cannot save any money from my income. Despite this, I am happy." Then, the banker said, "I have decided to get rid you of poverty. Take this ten thousand taka, preserve them carefully and use them in time of want." The cobbler who had never seen so much money at a time in his life before got startled, and came back home quickly. After returning home, he was restless as he could not find any safe place to hide the money. At last, he dug a hole inside his room and hid the money in it. At night, he was unable to sleep as he was obsessed with the money. He would remain alert the successive few nights. Thus, he lost his sleep and| happiness. One day, he went to the banker and told mental peace. So, he requested the banker to take his | him that his money had snatched away his sleep and money back. Finally, the cobbler gave the money to the banker. Now, he was able to enjoy sound sleep as before.

Explanation:
A fitting completion shows the cobbler answering that he earns just enough and is happy, which directly answers the banker's question while preserving the cheerful tone and resolving the conflict. This works because the story uses contrast between wealth and contentment to teach that happiness depends on attitude, not money, conveyed through simple dialogue and character action.

Bithi- A Good Hearted Street Orphan

Bithi is a shelterless, helpless street orphan of ten years who sells flowers on the intersections of Dhaka street. She lives on the income of what she gets from selling flowers. One day, while selling flowers in the traffic jam, she saw a foreign lady walking on the nearby footpath. Bithi noticed that the lady was not feeling well. Within a few seconds, the lady fell on the ground. So, she ran to the unconscious lady. In the meantime, the signal turned green and all the vehicles started moving. That's why Bithi found none to call for help and she got really puzzled. She thought for a moment and sprinkled some water on the lady's face and tried to wake her up. The lady opened her eyes, tried to say something but she failed to say anything. Then Bithi stopped a rickshaw puller and requested to help her. After that, they took her to the nearby hospital. Though the rickshaw puller left, Bithi stayed there. The duty doctors started the procedure. After a while, they took the lady out of the emergency for treatment. Before losing her sense again, last thing she noticed was a sad and tensed face of a little girl.

Bithi came out of the hospital but she could not forget the incident. She became busy in her regular life. Still, she remembers the foreign lady, her blank look, both of their helplessness now and then. A few months later, while selling flowers in the same location the incident took place, she notices a mini crowd of the street children on the footpath. She also goes there to find out what is happening. After going there, with utter surprise, Bithi finds out that the same lady is searching someone in the crowd. When the lady notices Bithi, she comes to her and hugs her really tight. After this meeting, everything changes in Bithi's life. The lady takes her to a place where there are so many children like her. They study there and and also get trained for different things. Now, Bithi does not have to worry about her shelter, food or any of the basic needs. Moreover, everyone is very affectionate to her. The lady also visits her very often. She has introduced Bithi to her family as well. Bithi likes them very much. Now she does not feel lonely anymore and she knows the feeling to be loved and cared.

Solution:
Helping Someone in Need

One day I was going to college to take my final exam at 10 am. At 9, when I was 20 minutes away from my college, suddenly a sick old man fell down. People ran to him. I saw him lying on the road. He was still breathing but was not responding. I was at a loss of what to do. I thought about running back home and getting help. Then someone there said that we should call an ambulance. I immediately called the national emergency service 999 to send for an ambulance. They instructed me to start doing CPR before the ambulance arrived.

By this time, he was hardly breathing, and only god knows when the ambulance would arrive. I had never done CPR in my life before, only watched people do it in the movies. I tried to do CPR on the man but it was harder than I imagined. You have to press with a great force and it was so scary to do as it may even break the ribcage.. After about ten minutes, the ambulance arrived. They rushed the man in. When the ambulance left, it was 9.50 a.m. already. I, then called the nearby rickshaw and hopped onto it. I reached the college at 10.15. The teachers did not like me being 15 minutes late for my final exam. I tried to explain what happened but they did not want to be bothered with a story. I was breathless when I started my exam as I came running towards the exam hall. I felt dizzy and lost. Then I calmed myself down, drank some water and started writing my answers. I was already 25 minutes late when I started writing. I, however, do not regret helping the old man in need as humanity always comes first to me. I would rather be late for helping a distressed person in need, than be on time for my exam, leaving the old man lying unattended on the road.

One day, she hit upon a plan that she would cut the belly of the goose and get all the eggs of gold. She told her husband about her plan. Her husband, who was wise but not greedy, said to her, "Don't be greedy. Be happy with what we have." But the farmer's wife did not listen to him. She cut the belly of the goose with a sharp knife. But alas! She found no egg in it. Thus, the greedy wife lost his valuable goose.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Adapting to Change: A Family's Experience in Lockdown

It was 20 March of 2020. Sarah was very happy because of her family was going to have a tour to Saint Martin Island the next week. She was watching TV with a jolly mood. Suddenly, a news popped up - "Government has declared lockdown for a period of 15 days all over the country with a view to controlling the spread of Covid-19 and protecting people from being infected with it. Sarah's face fell as she heard the news. Her family's trip to Saint Martin Island was now cancelled and they were going to be stuck at home for the next 15 days. She felt sad and disappointed but she also knew that the government's decision was necessary to protect people from the virus.

Sarah's family decided to make the best of the situation and use the time to bond and spend quality time together. They played board games, watched movies, and cooked meals together. Sarah was surprised at how much fun she was having with her family despite being stuck at home.

As the days went by, Sarah became more aware of the gravity of the situation. She saw the news reports of people falling ill and dying from the virus. She realized that the government's decision to lockdown the country was to protect people like her and her family from getting infected. She felt grateful to be safe at home with her loved ones and vowed to do her part in preventing the spread of the virus by staying at home and following the guidelines set by the government.

Sarah learned that sometimes difficult decisions have to be made for the greater good and that it's important to make the most of a bad situation. She also learned the importance of family and how much they mean to her. She was determined to cherish and appreciate the time she has with them even more in the future.

Explanation:
A good continuation ends with Sarah and her family responding realistically to the lockdown—canceling or postponing the trip, feeling disappointed, and then taking practical steps to stay safe. This is correct because it reflects the real consequences of a nationwide lockdown and shows characters adapting by following health rules, communicating, and finding alternative ways to enjoy time together. Such a continuation teaches responsibility, emotional resilience, and creates a clear, believable narrative arc.

A Wise Judge

Once a golden necklace was lost from a rich man's house. A few servants worked in that house. Naturally, it was suspected that any one of the servants had stolen the necklace. The rich man asked all of them but none of them confessed their guilt. So the rich man went to a judge. The judge was very wise. He called all the servants and asked them about the incident. All of them denied the charge. Then the judge hit upon a plan to find out the real thief. He gave each of them a stick of the same length and told them to return the sticks the next day. He told them that the stick of the real thief would increase by an inch. Returning home, all the servants kept their sticks as they were except the servant who stole the necklace. He shortened his stick by an inch. The next day when all the servants returned their sticks before the judge, the real thief was easily detected. Then the thief was given his due punishment.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Monon's Struggle

Monon has studied Information and Communication Technology at a public university. He wants to be a skillful engineer. He is going to enter the job market and preparing himself accordingly. One day a company offers a job to Monon. He is over the moon to get a job offer so soon. He prepares himself for the job interview. On the day of the interview he got up early and got dressed nicely. The interview went well, but there was a fetch. At the end of the interview one of the interviewers indirectly asked him for bribe. He was shocked. They asked for a large amount of money that Monon could not afford. They told him to go home and think about it.

He went home heartbroken. His parents asked what happened and he explained everything. He was in a dilemma. He needed the job, but not at the cost of compromising his morality. Also, they could not afford to give away such a large sum of money. Monon felt like this country is full of corruption and there is no evaluation of talent. He felt like leaving the country and settling abroad. But he is the only child of his parents. So, leaving the country was really not an option for him. He decided to let go of that job offer and wait for other interview calls.

A month later, he got called for another interview. The interview went well, but he did not get called. Monon started to grow frustrated. He had applied to several companies but got interview calls from very few. He started having recurring thoughts of leaving the country for higher studies, but he was not able to leave his parents alone. He slowly started to fall into depression. A year later, he got another job offer. After doing some back and forth;he was finally able to land the job. He became hopeful about his life again and as he started to work, he began to slowly come out of depression. He was then able to help his parents financially which boosted his self-esteem. Monon realized that unemployment created depression in him and ruined his self-esteem. He promised himself that he would help the educated unemployed youths around him to get jobs and thus help them live their lives to the full potential.

Explanation:
Accepting the job makes sense because it gives Monon real-world experience to apply his ICT knowledge and build the practical skills needed to become a skillful engineer. He should confirm the role offers learning opportunities, mentorship, and room for growth so the job contributes to his career goals; if not, he can negotiate or keep searching while continuing to prepare.

Honesty is the Best Policy: A Story of a Boy's Integrity

One day a boy of class five was going to school. Suddenly he saw a money bag on the road. He was at a loss. However, he quickly decided what to do. He walked to his school teacher's office and told her about the money bag he had found on the road. The teacher was impressed by his honesty and decided to help him return the money bag to its rightful owner. They opened the bag and found that it contained a large sum of money. The teacher contacted the local police and reported the find. After a few days, the police were able to track down the owner of the money bag, who was a local businessman. He had been on his way to the bank when he lost the bag. He was very grateful to the boy and the teacher for returning the money to him and he wanted to reward the boy for his honesty. The businessman gave the boy a generous reward and also offered him a scholarship for his education.

The boy felt proud of himself for doing the right thing and learned that honesty is the best policy. He realised that the reward he received for being honest was much greater than anything he could have gained by keeping the money for himself. He also learned that honesty is not only a moral virtue but also a practical one. He shared his experience with his classmates and encouraged them to always be honest and to do the right thing, even if it is difficult.

The whole school was proud of the boy's actions and the school principal even mentioned his story during the morning assembly. The boy was celebrated as an example of honesty and integrity.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A Thirsty Crow/Necessity is the Mother of Invention

Once upon a time, a crow was very thirsty. It flew from place to place in search of water but unfortunately it did not find any water. All on a sudden, it saw a pitcher. It peeped into the pitcher and saw that there was a little wate at the bottom of the pitcher. It tried to drink some water but its bill could not reach the water. It tried again and again but in vain. It became very sad and hopeless. Suddenly, it saw some pebbles near the pitcher. A good idea came into its mind. The crow picked up the pebbles and dropped them into the pitcher one by one. As a result, the water came up to the brim. The crow then drank water from it to its heart's content and flew away with a joyful mind. Thus, its cleverness helped it satisfy its thirst.

Explanation:
The correct answer is "a pitcher (or pot) of water" because the thirsty crow, searching for water, would naturally see a vessel containing water; this matches the familiar fable "The Crow and the Pitcher," where the crow finds a pitcher of water and uses pebbles to drink.

Solution:
An Honest Woodcutter and a Beautiful Fairy

Once, there lived a poor woodcutter. But he was very honest. He earned his livelihood by selling wood in the market. One day, while he was cutting wood near a pond, suddenly, his axe fell into the pond. The pond was very deep. The woodcutter did not know how to swim or dive. So, he was sitting there sadly. Then a wonderful thing happened. A beautiful fairy appeared before the woodcutter. She asked him in a sweet voice, "Why are you so sad? Why are you not cutting wood?" The woodcutter replied sorrowfully, "My axe has fallen into the pond. I can't cut wood now." The fairy then showed him an axe made of silver and asked him if it was his axe. The woodcutter saw the axe and said, "It's not my axe." The fairy showed him another axe made of gold and asked, "Is this the axe that you lost?" The woodcutter said, "No, it's not. My axe is made of iron. It was old." The fairy showed him the lost axe with a wooden handle. The woodcutter then said happily that it was his axe. The fairy became very pleased and gave him the golden and the silver axes too as a reward of his honesty. The wood cutter became very happy getting the axes made of golden and silver. He thanked the fairy and went home. Later, selling those two axes in the market, he made quite a good amount of money. He became solvent and started passing his days happily ever after. Thus, the honest people are rewarded everywhere for their honesty.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct answer is "was cutting wood near the river" because the past continuous tense describes an action that was in progress at a particular time and sets the scene for what follows (for example, his axe slipping into the water). Using past continuous is natural here to show an ongoing activity that gets interrupted by the next event in the story.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Privileged Should Extend Helping Hands to the Poor

It was a bright sunny morning. I was going to college with some of my friends. We were in a hilarious mood as we were talking about our plan to go on a picnic. Suddenly, we noticed an old woman who was begging money for her ailing son. It was hard for us to turn a blind eye. Her torn clothes and sad face brought tears to our eyes and we decided to help her. When we asked her about her son, she replied that her son was a garments worker and had been crippled due to an accident in the factory. The owner did not provide any compensation, and since then, she had to beg for buying foods and medicine for her son. All of us felt sorrow for the unfortunate woman and gave her the money we saved for the picnic. Then, we again started for the college while thanking the Almighty about our privileged lives. We have our health, a roof over our head, foods on table and a million other blessings to count. It is the duty of the wealthy and the privileged section of the society to come forward to aid these unfortunate people.

Explanation:
Explanation: The continuation that follows a sudden, unexpected event is correct because the word "Suddenly…" signals a shift from a relaxed scene to a conflict or surprise, so the story should introduce an incident that disrupts the picnic plan. This uses the basic storytelling principle of cause-and-effect—an unexpected event provokes characters' reactions and drives the plot forward. Keep sensory details and characters' responses clear to make the turn believable and engaging.

Where There Is a Will, There Is a Way

Parul was a school girl whose parents were landless. They were unable to bear her educational expenses. But Parul was determined to complete her studies. In her class, she was the best student. Her teachers always encouraged her to do better in school. However, she could not afford to attend classes regularly as she had to help her parents in their daily chores. Moreover, she tutored a few students in the evening in order to bear a minimum academic expenses. One day, one of her teachers found her sobbing at the corner of her classroom. He gently asked her, "What's wrong, Parul?" Hearing his voice, Parul was a bit startled and answered, "Nothing Sir, I am fine." The teacher, however, insisted to know if he could help her in any way. Parul then told him that she was not able to pay for the registration of SSC exam. The teacher knew how hardworking and diligent Parul was! He promptly spoke to the headmaster concerning her situation and managed to offer her a waiver for the registration fee. Six months later, when she had already appeared on the Board Exam and her result had also been published, she was weeping again. This time, it was for her brilliant result. She had achieved GPA-5.0!

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Obsession with Money

Once, there lived a happy cobbler in a town. He passed his days in singing and dancing. A rich neighbour of his was a banker. One day, the banker said to him, "How much a year do you earn?" The cobbler smiled and said, "I do not know, sir. I have never counted in that way, as I live from hand to mouth. Everyday I earn and I buy my meal with that income and return home. I cannot save any money from my income. Despite this, I am happy." Then, the banker said, "I have decided to get rid you of poverty. Take this ten thousand taka, preserve them carefully and use them in time of want." The cobbler who had never seen so much money at a time in his life before got startled, and came back home quickly. After returning home, he was restless as he could not find any safe place to hide the money. At last, he dug a hole inside his room and hid the money in it. At night, he was unable to sleep as he was obsessed with the money. He would remain alert the successive few nights. Thus, he lost his sleep and| happiness. One day, he went to the banker and told mental peace. So, he requested the banker to take his | him that his money had snatched away his sleep and money back. Finally, the cobbler gave the money to the banker. Now, he was able to enjoy sound sleep as before.

Explanation:
Explanation: The phrase "passed his days in singing and dancing" is correct because "in" is followed by gerund verbs ("singing," "dancing") that name activities, and the whole phrase means he "spent his time" doing those activities. This uses the idiom "pass one’s days in + -ing" to show a habitual or continuous way of living.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
The Photograph

In an afternoon, Grandmother was knitting a scarf under a mango tree in the yard. Romim, her grandson, suddenly came running to her with an old photograph in his hand.. Showing the photograph to his grandmother, Romim asked who in the photograph was. 'The grandmother was very reluctant to let him know the fact. She kept him in curiosity for a long time. But looking at the photograph, she became nostalgic. She beautifully described the atmosphere and. surroundings in the photograph to her grandchild. The description given by the grandmother suggested that the girl in the photograph was none but she herself. Her description of the surroundings also suggested that she was very romantic, though she seemed to be a bit harsh by her attitude.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct continuation has Romim asking his grandmother about the people in the photograph because handing an old picture to an elder naturally signals a request for identification or stories. This follows narrative coherence—his hurried approach with a meaningful object prompts a reaction (memory, recognition, or storytelling) from the grandmother.

Rima's Visit to a Book Fair

Rima is a girl of HSC 1st year at a renowned college. In the month of February, she was eagerly waiting to join a 'Book Fair' but her parents interrupted her from going outside. They told her that she was not allowed to go alone anywhere except to college. She tried to convince her parents saying that she would be accompanied by three other girls from her college and that they would be in burkhas. After listening to her, the parents said, "We're sorry that we can't allow you to go outside without being accompanied by any male person." Rima was very sad. She could not understand the reasons of her parents' negative attitude towards her proposal of going to Ekushey Book Fair. How long she has waited to visit the fair! She started crying. Then, she went to her aunt living in the same area. She expressed her intention of visiting the fair. Her aunt was willing to help her. On Monday, she went to Rima's parents. She said to them, "Rima's uncle and cousin are going to Dhaka on Thursday to visit the Ekushey Book Fair and they will return to Manikganj in the evening. So, Rima can go with them to visit the 'Book Fair'. At last, Rima's parents permitted her to go to the fair. They said to her, "You may go to the fair with your uncle and cousin, but take care of yourself."

Explanation:
The correct answer is that her parents stopped her because they wanted her to prioritize her HSC studies (and possibly her safety or the family’s practical concerns) over attending the book fair. This is reasonable since parents often restrict leisure activities when important exams or responsibilities are imminent, so choosing study and long-term goals over a short outing fits the context.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A Sly Fox and a Foolish Crow

Once, a crow was sitting on the branch of a tree. It had a piece of meat in its beak. Suddenly, a fox came there. When he came under that tree, he noticed the meat in the crow's beak. The sight of the piece of meat made his mouth filled with water. He thought for sometimes. Then, he hit upon a plan to have it. He said to the crow, "Oh beautiful crow! Your complexion is so fair. I think, you can sing nicely. Would you please sing a song for me?" At first, the crow did not want to sing. But as the fox carried on praising her, she felt proud of her tongue. Finally, she started to sing a song. But no sooner had she opened her mouth than the piece of meat fell off her mouth. In the meantime, the clever fox took it and ran away. The crow had paid a heavy price for her foolishness.

Explanation:
The fox praised the crow to make it proud, so the crow opened its beak to sing and dropped the meat, which the fox then took — that explains why the fox succeeded. The lesson is that flattery can trick people into foolish actions, so don’t let pride or desire for praise override common sense.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
An Ant and a Dove

Once upon a time, there lived a dove. It was passing its days happily. One day, while he was sitting on a tree beside a river, he saw an ant. He was about to drown. Feeling pity for the ant, the dove wanted to save it. So, he dropped a leaf in front of the ant. The ant got on the leaf and the dove took the leaf on the bank of the pond. Thus, the dove saved the ant's life. Being grateful, the ant thanked him a lot. Another day, when the ant was seeking food under that tree, it noticed that a hunter had aimed at the dove. The dove did not know it. The ant thought, "I must save the life of the dove as it had saved mine one day". So, he bit on the right leg of the hunter. At this, the hunter's hands trembled and the bullet missed its aim. Then the dove flew away and was saved.

Solution:
Honesty is the Best Policy: A Story of a Girl's Integrity

One day a girl of class five was going to school. Suddenly she saw a money bag on the road. She was at a loss. However, She quickly decided what to do. She walked to her school teacher's office and told her about the money bag she had found on the road. The teacher was impressed by her honesty and decided to help him return the money bag to its rightful owner. They opened the bag and found that it contained a large sum of money. The teacher contacted the local police and reported the find. After a few days, the police were able to track down the owner of the money bag, who was a local businessman. He had been on his way to the bank when he lost the bag. He was very grateful to the girl and the teacher for returning the money to him and he wanted to reward the girl for her honesty. The businessman gave the girl a generous reward and also offered him a scholarship for her education.

The girl felt proud of herself for doing the right thing and learned that honesty is the best policy. She realised that the reward she received for being honest was much greater than anything she could have gained by keeping the money for herself. She also learned that honesty is not only a moral virtue but also a practical one. She shared her experience with her classmates and encouraged them to always be honest and to do the right thing, even if it is difficult.

The whole school was proud of the girl's actions and the school principal even mentioned his story during the morning assembly. The girl was celebrated as an example of honesty and integrity. Her story spread around the school and even the town and she became known as an example of honesty and integrity and a role model for other children.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
An Ant and a Dove Once

Once, an ant was very thirsty. He went to a river to drink water. When he began to drink water, a wave swept him away. He was about to drown. There was a tree on the bank of the river and a dove was sitting on a branch of it. She noticed that the ant was about to drown. Feeling pity for the ant, the dove wanted to save him. So, she dropped a leaf in front of the ant. The ant got on the leaf and the dove took the leaf on the bank of the river. Thus the dove saved the ant's life. Being grateful, the ant thanked her a lot. Another day, when the ant was seeking food under that tree, he noticed that a hunter was aiming at the dove. The dove did not notice it. The ant thought, "I must save the life of the dove as she saved mine the other day". So, he bit on the right leg of the hunter. At this the hunter's hands trembled and the bullet missed its aim. Then, the dove flew away and was saved.

Explanation:
Explanation: "Washed him away" is correct because a moving wave exerts a force on small objects and carries them along, so the ant would be carried off by the water. In a past-tense narrative we use the past simple verb "washed" to describe that completed action.

Solution:
A Thirsty Crow

Once upon a time, a crow became very thirsty. It was summer and the weather was very hot. There was little water in that place. The crow flew here and there looking for water. But it could not find water anywhere. It seems that it was about to die for the thirst of water. But it did not lose heart.

The crow continued its search and found a pitcher to drink water. But there was a little water at the bottom of the pitcher. The crow tried to drink but failed. The water level was too far for the crow’s beak to reach. It tried to find out a good plan. At once it hit upon a plan. It picked up stones one by one and dropped them into the pitcher. After dropping a number of stones, the water level in the jar roses high enough to reach. Then, the crow drank water. Thus the crow saved his life by the use of his wisdom.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Pranks are not Always Fun

It was late at night. I was taking preparation for my ensuing examination. All the members of my family were sleeping. All on a sudden, my phone rang and it was an unknown number. I got frightened because late night phone calls either mean an emergency or something scary to me. My father was out on an official tour and suddenly it came to my mind that something might have happened to him. I received the call and asked who it was. No one replied but I heard that someone heaved a deep sigh. It made me more scared and I repeated the same question. But the result was same; no one replied. After six or seven minutes, suddenly someone burst into laughter and hung up the phone. I was utterly horrified and confused. That incident made me so disturbed that I couldn't even concentrate on my studies anymore. The next day, after finishing the exam I came across a friend who revealed that one of my classmates played a prank on me last night. I was so shocked that I met him for a reasonable answer. He told that he loved to play prank on others but he meant no harm. I advised him not to do that again. All of us must be careful about our actions and shouldn't do anything which hampers the peace of others' minds.

Explanation:
The situation — late at night, everyone asleep, and an unexpected call from an unknown number — creates a sudden, alarming event, so the natural immediate reaction is fear. In narrative past tense, "I got frightened" correctly expresses that sudden emotional response inferred from those context clues.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
A Liar Cowboy

There was a naughty cowboy who grazed his cows beside a forest. He used to make fun with people crying Tiger! Tiger! Help! Help!" The villagers heard his cry and ran to help him. When they came near him, they found no tiger there and the boy laughed at them. The villagers were fooled by the cunning boy and hence, they went away. After a few days, he made the same fun and the villagers came again to help him but found no tiger there. One day, a tiger really came and it attacked the cattle. The boy somehow climbed up a tree and shouted for help. The villagers heard him but they thought that he was kidding again and so, no one came to help him. The tiger killed one of his cows and took it away. The boy felt sorry for his silly joke. From then, he promised not to tell a lie and befool people again.

Explanation:
Because he kept shouting "Tiger!" as a joke when there was no danger, people stopped believing him and ignored his warnings when real danger came. The underlying idea is that lying destroys trust, so false alarms make genuine warnings ineffective.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Innovation of the Innovative Boy

There was a boy who hailed from an obscure background. But he was brilliant, diligent and innovative. He belonged to a village where there was no electricity. During summer, the atmosphere of the village was hot and humid. The villagers were even suffering from the high temperature at home. They were becoming sick due to hot weather. Some of them even died of heat stroke. The boy, however, was thinking of an idea how to get rid of the heat. He came to know from a physics teacher of his school that the gas cools when it expands quickly. So, he thought of making an air cooler out of plastic bottles for his own house. So, he collected some plastic bottles and cut them into half. Then, he mounted them on a board. After that, he placed the board over a window, with the bottlenecks facing towards the inner side of the house. As a result, the change in pressure that occurred when air entered the wider part of the bottle and came out through the bottleneck cooled the air. That's how he successfully made the air cooler out of the plastic bottles. When the villagers found it effective, they requested the boy to make the cooler for them too. As the raw plastic bottles were easily available, the cooler could be made easily and it was cheap as well. In this way, the boy could reduce the sufferings of the village and also earn some money.

Explanation:
Explanation: The best completion is a phrase like "made a name for himself" (or "rose to prominence") because the contrast introduced by "But" and the qualities "brilliant, diligent and innovative" imply a resulting rise to recognition or success. In sentence completion, choose a continuation that logically follows from the prior information—here, his talents explain why someone from an obscure background would become well known.

Solution:
An Honest Woodcutter and a Beautiful Fairy

Once, there lived a poor woodcutter. But he was very honest. He earned his livelihood by selling wood in the market. One day, while he was cutting wood near a pond, suddenly, his axe fell into the pond. The pond was very deep. The woodcutter did not know how to swim or dive. So, he was sitting there sadly. Then a wonderful thing happened. A beautiful fairy appeared before the woodcutter. She asked him in a sweet voice, "Why are you so sad? Why are you not cutting wood?" The woodcutter replied sorrowfully, "My axe has fallen into the pond. I can't cut wood now." The fairy then showed him an axe made of silver and asked him if it was his axe. The woodcutter saw the axe and said, "It's not my axe." The fairy showed him another axe made of gold and asked, "Is this the axe that you lost?" The woodcutter said, "No, it's not. My axe is made of iron. It was old." The fairy showed him the lost axe with a wooden handle. The woodcutter then said happily that it was his axe. The fairy became very pleased and gave him the golden and the silver axes too as a reward of his honesty. The wood cutter became very happy getting the axes made of golden and silver. He thanked the fairy and went home. Later, selling those two axes in the market, he made quite a good amount of money. He became solvent and started passing his days happily ever after. Thus, the honest people are rewarded everywhere for their honesty.

Explanation:
The correct answer ("was cutting wood in the forest") fits because the passage says he earned his living by selling wood, so his likely activity at that moment is cutting wood. Use context clues and coherence—choose the option that logically follows the character's occupation and leads naturally into the next events of the story.

It was a bright sunny morning. I was going to college with some of my friends. We were in a hilarious mood as we were talking about our plan to go on a picnic. Suddenly, we noticed an old woman who was begging money for her ailing son. It was hard for us to turn a blind eye. Her torn clothes and sad face brought tears to our eyes and we decided to help her. When we asked her about her son, she replied that her son was a garments worker and had been crippled due to an accident in the factory. The owner did not provide any compensation, and since then, she had to beg for buying foods and medicine for her son. All of us felt sorrow for the unfortunate woman and gave her the money we saved for the picnic. Then, we again started for the college while thanking the Almighty about our privileged lives. We have our health, a roof over our head, foods on table and a million other blessings to count. It is the duty of the wealthy and the privileged section of the society to come forward to aid these unfortunate people.

Once on a summer day, the scorching heat of the sun induced a Lion and a Boar to come at the same moment to a small well to drink. They fiercely disputed which of them should drink first, and were soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal combat. They attacked each other with the utmost fury. It seemed that the fight would not be ceased until or unless one of them was dead. However, when they stopped to catch their breath for a fiercer renewal of the fight, they saw some vultures seated on a rock above evidently waiting for one of them or both to be killed. Then those vultures would fly down to feast on the carcase. The sight sobered them at once, and they came to realize that unnecessary fight would bring misery only for themselves. They at once made up their quarrel, saying, “It is better for us to make friends, than to become the food of Crows or Vultures.”

Solution:
Ans.

Selfishness to Kindness

Once, there was a selfish giant who had a large and beautiful garden. The garden was full of soft green grass. Here and there all over the grass stood many colourful flowers like stars. The garden was a playground for the beautiful children. The children used to like the garden very much. So, they came to the garden every day to play different kinds of games. But they did not know that the selfish giant was the owner of the garden. They came and played as usual. Suddenly the giant noticed the children playing in his garden. Then he planned to make a big wall so that they could not enter the garden. Ultimately he made a big wall. As a result, the children coming near the garden could not enter into it. In the meantime, the garden had been flowerless and grass less. It was losing its beauty gradually. The selfish giant thought himself of the matter. At this he got into a great tension and tried to find out the real cause behind it. At last, he realized his mistakes and said to himself, - "Children are the great blessings of the garden". He called the children, made a good relationship with them and loved them from his core of heart. He allowed them to enter the garden and play again. Then the garden started to get back its beauty slowly. And eventually, it became the same as like as it was before. Thus, the selfish giant gained self-knowledge and self-realization through his mistakes.

Explanation:
Explanation: Completing the story by showing the giant’s change from selfishness to kindness is right because it follows the setup—the beautiful garden and the giant’s cruelty create a clear contrast that invites a moral resolution. This teaches the concept of character development and cause-and-effect: selfish actions bring loneliness or “winter,” while generosity restores warmth and life. Keeping the garden and children as symbols helps readers understand the lesson about compassion and the rewards of sharing.

An Honest Woodcutter and a Beautiful Fairy Once, there lived a woodcutter. He was very poor but honest. He lived on the bank of a river near a jungle. He used to cut wood to earn his living. One day, he was cutting wood near a pond. Suddenly, his axe fell into the pond. The pond was very deep. The woodcutter did not know how to swim or dive. So, he was sitting there sadly. Then, a wonderful thing happened. A beautiful fairy appeared before the woodcutter. She asked him in a sweet voice, "Why are you so sad? Why are you not cutting wood?" The woodcutter replied sorrowfully, "My axe has fallen into the pond. I can't cut wood now." The fairy then showed him an axe made of silver and asked him if it was his axe. The woodcutter saw the axe and said, "It's not my axe." The fairy showed him another axe made of gold and asked, "Is this the axe that you lost?" The woodcutter said, "No, it's not: My axe is made of iron. It was old." The fairy showed him the lost axe with a wooden handle. The woodcutter then said happily that it was his axe. The fairy became very pleased and gave him the gold and the silver axes too as a reward of his honesty. The wood cutter became very happy getting the axes made of gold and silver. He thanked the fairy and went home. Later, selling those two axes in the market, he made quite a good amount of money. He became solvent and started passing his days happily ever after. Thus, the honest people are rewarded everywhere.

Explanation:
Explanation: The continuation that shows the woodcutter remaining honest and being rewarded fits the opening because the story explicitly sets up his poverty and honesty, which signals a moral folktale pattern where character traits determine outcomes. Such an ending maintains narrative coherence (his honesty logically leads to a positive consequence) and reinforces the intended lesson about integrity. When completing the story, keep the tone simple, make the consequences follow naturally from his actions, and show how the choice reflects the theme.

An Idle Farmer/Consequence of Idleness

Once, there was a farmer in a village. He was very idle. He had a few plots of land. But he did not plough them well. He did not sow seeds in time. He had a kitchen garden, too. One day, he saw that the fencing round the garden was broken by a herd of goats. The farmer said, "I will repair the fence tomorrow." But the next day he would totally forget it. One day, while sitting in the yard, he noticed that some goats had entered the garden. He told his wife, who was cooking, to tend the goats. When his wife went to the garden, a dog entered the kitchen and was snatching something. She took a heavy piece of wood and threw it to the dog. The wood missed its aim and hit the little son of the farmer who was playing in the yard. The son got seriously injured. At this, the farmer understood the consequence of his idleness and promised that he would not leave today's work for tomorrow.

Explanation:
Because the opening shows the farmer’s laziness (he did not plough or sow in time), a correct continuation that describes poor harvests and the farmer’s eventual decision to work harder follows logically by cause and effect. This teaches the simple moral that effort and responsibility lead to better outcomes, so completing the story with consequences and a change in the farmer’s behavior gives a clear resolution and character development.

Solution:
Ans.

The Privileged should Extend Helping Hands to the Poor

It was a bright sunny morning. I was going to college with some of my friends. We were in a hilarious mood as we were talking about our plan to go on a picnic. Suddenly, we noticed an old woman who was begging money for her ailing son. It was hard for us to turn a blind eye. Her torn clothes and sad face brought tears to our eyes and we decided to help her. When we asked her about her son, she replied that her son was a garments worker and had been crippled due to an accident in the factory. The owner did not provide any compensation, and since then, she had to beg for buying food and medicine for her son. All of us felt sorrow for the unfortunate woman and gave her the money we saved for the picnic. Then, we again started for the college while thanking the Almighty about our privileged lives. We have our health, a roof over our head, food on table and a million other blessings to count. It is the duty of the wealthy and the privileged section of the society to come forward to aid these unfortunate people.

Explanation:
Explanation: A correct continuation keeps the bright, playful mood but introduces a clear turning point (for example, a sudden accident or surprise) that creates conflict and drives the story forward. It shows believable reactions from the narrator and friends, uses specific details to make the scene vivid, and leads to a plausible outcome or lesson. This approach ensures coherence, emotional engagement, and a satisfying narrative arc for readers.

Solution:

Ismail Miah's Success

Ismail Miah is an established farmer of Dhunchi, a village standing on the bank of the Padma. Though he was born in a poor family, today he is an idol to the hardworking youths of the area. One day, he told them about his success story to illustrate how success in life only comes with hard work, perseverance and luck. He lost both his parents at a young age, so he had to take the helms of his family. He struggled to make ends meet, spending days shining shoes, and nights learning about agriculture. Then he saw an advert for a farming idea competition, where the winner would receive a grant to start his own agro venture. Fast-forward 5 years, after Ismail Miah's brilliant idea of column-based plantations won top credit, life took an uphill climb. Ismail Miah was fortunate enough to have also received training to ensure he could maximize profits while minimizing costs. Initially he had to put in 15 to 18 hours on a daily basis. However, as the days progressed, he gathered enough profits to hire help. He credited local government ventures, perseverance and hard work for his success. "But above all, I feel like you also need just a pinch of luck, and I think I had just that much!" Ismail said with a wide-toothed grin.

Solution:

Fardin's Determination

Fardin was an educated young man. After completing his MA, he went to Dhaka in search of a job. He applied for various posts, but he did not get any. Being frustrated, he returned to his native village. As he was a highly qualified man he did not want to depend on others any longer. He became determined to stand on his own feet and be self-reliant. One day, one of his teachers advised him to go to an NGO and apply for micro-credit. As advised, he went to an NGO of his village and applied for micro-credit. The NGO granted him a handsome money. With the money, Fardin opened a restaurant in his village. As Fardin's mother was a great cook, she initially cooked for the restaurant. The villagers used to come to his restaurant and have food. Fardin began to earn money. Later he hired two cooks and expanded the restaurant. Soon he became solvent. Now he is one of the richest men of his village. Thus, he became an example for the young men who are qualified but jobless.

Solution:
The Two Fight, The Third BenefitsOnce on a summer day, the scorching heat of the sun induced a Lion and a Boar to come at the same moment to a small well to drink. They fiercely disputed which of them should drink first, and were soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal combat. They attacked each other with the utmost fury. It seemed that the fight would not be ceased until or unless one of them was dead. However, when they stopped to catch their breath for a fiercer renewal of the fight, they saw some vultures seated on a rock above evidently waiting for one of them or both to be killed. Then those vultures would fly down to feast on the carcase. The sight sobered them at once, and they came to realize that unnecessary fight would bring misery only for themselves. They at once made up their quarrel, saying, "It is better for us to make friends than to become the food of Crows or Vultures.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Selfish Giant

Once, there was a selfish giant who had a large and beautiful garden. The garden was full of soft green grass. Here and there all over the grass stood many colourful flowers like stars. The garden was a playground for the beautiful children. The children used to like the garden very much. So, they came to the garden every day to play different kinds of games. But they did not know that the selfish giant was the owner of the garden. They came and played as usual. Suddenly the giant noticed the children playing in his garden. Then he planned to make a big wall so that they could not enter the garden. Ultimately he made a big wall. As a result, the children coming near the garden could not enter into it. In the meantime, the garden had been flowerless and grass less. It was losing its beauty gradually. The selfish giant thought himself of the matter. At this he got into a great tension and tried to find out the real cause behind it. At last, he realized his mistakes and said to himself, "Children are the great blessings of the garden". He called the children, made a good relationship with them andloved them from his core of heart. He allowed them to enter the garden and play again. Then the garden started to get back its beauty slowly. And eventually, it became the same as like as it was before. Thus, the selfish giant gained self-knowledge and self-realization through his mistakes.

Explanation:
The correct ending shows the giant’s change from selfishness to kindness because the opening—his beautiful garden and his exclusion of children—sets up a moral lesson about sharing and compassion. Bringing children back and letting the garden bloom again demonstrates cause and effect (loneliness from selfishness versus joy from kindness) and gives the giant clear character growth. This resolution matches the story’s imagery and teaches that love and generosity restore life and happiness.

An Idle Farmer/Consequence of Idleness

Once, there was a farmer in a village. He was very idle. He had a few plots of land. But he did not plough them well. He did not sow seeds in time. He had a kitchen garden, too. One day, he saw that the fencing round the garden was broken by a herd of goats. The farmer said, "I will repair the fence tomorrow." But the next day he would totally forget it. One day, while sitting in the yard, he noticed that some goats had entered the garden. He told his wife, who was cooking, to tend the goats.

The wood missed its aim and hit the little son of the farmer who was playing in the yard. The son got seriously injured. At this, the farmer understood the consequence of his idleness and promised that he would not leave today's work for tomorrow.

Explanation:
The correct continuation should show the consequences of the farmer’s idleness (poor or no harvest) and then either his suffering or a lesson learned. This is right because the opening sets up a clear cause (neglecting the land), so a natural effect and a moral resolution follow, which makes the story coherent. That structure helps students see cause-and-effect and understand the theme of responsibility.

The Naughty Boys and the Frogs

There was an old pond in a village. It was full of frogs. The frogs were living happily there. Some of them often put their heads out of the water and croaked loudly. One day, some boys were playing by the side of the pond. When they heard the frogs croaking, they started throwing stones at the frogs and made fun. The stone hit the frogs. As a result, some frogs were killed and many were wounded. The frogs were very much puzzled and did not know what to do. At last, an old frog raised its head and said, "Dear little boys, why are you killing us?" The boys said, "We are not killing you. We are just playing." Then the frog said, "What is play to you is death to us." The boys became very sorry and ashamed. So, they stopped their game and left the place.

Question:
Leaves tumble in late October: they glitter in a brief sun, are lauded by children and passed along the lane, then rot unseen beneath the frost. The passerby praises their color, then slips onward when the chill bites. A small rhyme repeats: "Applaud the gold, then forget the hold."

ক. এই প্রস্তুতিটির মূল ভাব বা থিম কী?
খ. প্যারাগ্রাফে ব্যবহৃত দুইটি সাহিত্যিক অলঙ্কার চিহ্নিত করো ও সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে ব্যাখ্যা করো।
গ. "Applaud the gold, then forget the hold" এই লাইনটির অর্থ কী?
ঘ. প্যাসেজের টোন কিরূপ এবং কীভাবে সেটি গঠিত হয়েছে?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: প্রধান ভাব হলো প্রকৃতির অল্পস্থায়ী সৌন্দর্যকে মানুষের অস্থায়ী প্রশংসা ও অনুগামীতায় তুলনা করে মানুষের অনুগৃহীততা ও ভ্রান্ত পরিচর্যার প্রতি সমালোচনা। এখানে শীত আগােভাবেই মানুষের প্রত্যাহার ও উপেক্ষাকে প্রকৃতির ক্ষয়ক্ষতির সঙ্গে মিলিয়ে দেখানো হয়েছে।

খ উত্তর: 1) ব্যক্তিত্বদান (Personification): পাতা যেন মানুষ দ্বারা প্রশংসা পাওয়া ও ভুলে যাওয়ার মতো আচরণ করে — প্রকৃতি বা অজীব বস্তুকে মানবীয় গুণ দেওয়া হয়েছে। 2) বিপর্যয়বচকতা/ইরনি (Irony): পাতা তার চূড়ান্ত সৌন্দর্যে প্রশংসিত হয়, অথচ সেই প্রশংসা দীর্ঘস্থায়ী নয়; প্রশংসিত হওয়া সত্ত্বেও অবহেলায় পড়ে।

গ উত্তর: লাইনটির সাংগঠনিক অর্থ হলো: লোকেরা যখন কোনো জিনিস বা ব্যক্তির ঝলমলে দিক দেখে তখন তাতেই প্রশংসা করে, কিন্তু সত্যিকারের সংযোগ বা সহায়তা (the "hold") দেয় না; তারা ফুসফুসণভাবে বা অস্থায়ীভাবে সাদরে নেয় কিন্তু পরে তা ভুলে যায় বা ত্যাগ করে। এখানে "gold" সৌন্দর্য/সম্মান বোঝায় এবং "hold" স্থায়ী সমর্থন বা কৃতজ্ঞতা বোঝায়।

ঘ উত্তর: টোনটি ভাবগাম্ভীর্যপূর্ণ ও সামান্য নীরস; এতে হতাশা ও তীব্র সচেতনতার ছোঁয়া আছে। এটি গঠিত হয়েছে সংক্ষিপ্ত, চিত্রপূর্ণ বর্ণনা, পুনরাবৃত্ত রাইশ (refrain) এবং প্রকৃতির অস্থায়ীত্বকে মানুষের অনিন্দ্য আচরণের সঙ্গে মিলিয়ে ব্যাখ্যার মাধ্যমে।

Explanation:
বহুবিধ উপাদান—প্রকৃতির চিত্রায়ন, সংক্ষিপ্ত রৈখিক বিবরণ ও পুনরাবৃত্ত শ্লোক—মিলিয়ে প্যাসেজটি মানুষের অস্থায়ী প্রশংসা ও অনুগৃহীততার রাজনৈতিক ও নৈতিক দিক তুলে ধরে। ব্যক্তিত্বদান ও ইরনি ব্যবহার করে লেখক পাঠককে অনুভব করাতে চান যে যে যা দীপ্ত সেখানে স্থায়িত্ব নেই, বরং মানবিক সম্পর্কের অবনতি প্রকৃতির পতনের মতোই তীব্র।

Question:
At midnight the lamp hangs steady on the sill; outside, the moon moves slowly like a silent sentinel. Neighbors swear fealty behind closed doors, glasses clink at declared loyalties, and promises are made that melt with the dawn. A whispered line returns: "The moon keeps vigil; men keep change."

Options:
ক. এই দৃশ্যের কেন্দ্রীয় রূপক (central metaphor) কি এবং কীভাবে সেটি অর্থায়িত হয়েছে?
খ. দৃশ্যটি কোন ধরনের প্রতীকী ভঙ্গি ব্যবহার করে মানুষ ও বস্তু সম্পর্কিত বৈপরীত্য দেখায়? উদাহরণসহ বুঝাও।
গ. "men keep change" বলে কী বোঝানো হয়েছে? সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা দাও।
ঘ. কোন শব্দভঙ্গি বা শব্দচয়ন (diction) পাঠে 'মোহমায়া' বা নৈরাশ্য সৃষ্টি করেছে—দুবিধাহীন উদাহরণসহ ব্যাখ্যা করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: কেন্দ্রীয় রূপক হলো 'চাঁদ = অবিচল সাক্ষী/স্থিতপ্রজ্ঞ'। চাঁদকে একটি শান্ত, স্থির প্রহরী হিসেবে উপস্থাপন করা হয়েছে যা রাতভর দেখেও বদলায় না, যেখানে মানুষ তার প্রতিশ্রুতি ও দ্বিচারিতায় বদলে যায়। রূপকটি অর্থায়িত হয়েছে চাঁদের ধীর, নীরব উপস্থিতির সঙ্গে মানুষের অস্থিরতা ও পরিবর্তনশীল আচরণকে বিপরীতে রেখে।

খ উত্তর: এখানে ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে প্রতিকৃতি (antithesis) ও প্রতীকী পার্থক্য। উদাহরণ: "lamp hangs steady" ও "men keep change"—প্রকৃতির স্থিতি ও মানুষের অনৈক্যকে বিপরীতভাবে স্থাপন করে। এছাড়া "silent sentinel" (চাঁদ) বনাম "glasses clink" (মানুষের আড্ডা)—শান্ত নীরবতাকে বনাম কণ্ঠস্বরপূর্ণ নান্দনিকতা; ফলে মানুষ ও বস্তু বা প্রকৃতির মধ্যে বৈপরীত্য স্পষ্ট হয়।

গ উত্তর: "men keep change" বলতে বোঝানো হয়েছে মানুষের প্রবৃত্তি বারবার বদলাতে থাকা—সাহচর্য, অনুগৃহীততা, প্রতিশ্রুতি ইত্যাদি এক সময়ে নিবিড় হলেও পরবর্তী সময়ে খর্ব হয়ে যায়। অর্থাৎ মানুষ স্থিতিশীল নয়; তাদের আচরণ চাহিদা ও পরিস্থিতি অনুসারে পরিবর্তিত হয়।

ঘ উত্তর: প্যাসেজে ব্যবহৃত সংক্ষিপ্ত, নিরুৎসাহী শব্দভঙ্গি—যেমন "whispered", "silent", "vigil"—একদিকে নিরবতা ও চিরন্তনতার অনুভূতি জাগায়; অন্যদিকে "glasses clink", "promises melt"—স্বল্প জীবন ও অস্থায়িতায়কের সংকেত দেয়। এই বিরোধী শব্দচয়নই পাঠে মিশ্র আহ্লাদ ও নৈরাশ্য সৃষ্টি করে: শান্ত চিত্রে লুকানো মানুষের দ্বিচারিতা পাঠককে খানিকটা হতাশ করে।

Explanation:
রূপক ও প্রতীক ব্যবহার করে লেখক রাত ও চাঁদের স্থিতিকে স্থায়ী ও বিশ্বস্ত হিসেবে উপস্থাপন করেন, যেখানে মানুষের সামাজিক আচরণকে অনিশ্চিত ও পরিবর্তনশীল দেখানো হয়। শব্দচয়নের নিয়ন্ত্রিত ব্যবহার—নীরবতা নির্দেশক শব্দ ও উদ্দীপক সামাজিক ক্রিয়ার সংমিশ্রণ—টোন ঠিক করে এবং পাঠককে নৈর্ব্যক্তিক বাস্তবতার সঙ্গে মিশ্র অনুভূতি দেয়।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: মূল নৈতিক বার্তা হলো: বস্তুগত স্মৃতি (প্রাকৃতিক নিরীক্ষণ) স্থায়ী হতে পারে, কিন্তু মানুষের কৃতজ্ঞতা এবং স্মৃতিশক্তি অস্থায়ী; প্রকৃতি অনেক কিছুকে বহন করে রাখলেও মানুষের সম্পর্ক ও কৃতজ্ঞতা দ্রুত মলিন হয়ে যায়। একই সঙ্গে আলোকপাত করা হয়েছে যে কিছু লোক—মিলারের মতো—অবিশুদ্ধতায়ও সদয়তা ধরে রাখে।

খ উত্তর: নদীকে স্মরণশক্তি দেওয়া হল ব্যক্তীকরণ/ব্যক্তিত্বদান (personification)। এটি কার্যকর কারণ তা মানবীয় অনুভবের সঙ্গে অজীব বস্তুকে যুক্ত করে; পাঠককে মনে করায় যে নীরব প্রকৃতিও ইতিহাস বহন করে। এছাড়া এটি প্রতীকীও—নদী হল সময় বা স্মৃতি, যা সবকিছু বহন করে কিন্তু ফিরিয়ে দেয় না, ফলে মানুষের অপসারণ বা অবহেলার বিরুদ্ধে একটি স্তব্ধ সাক্ষ্য তৈরি হয়।

গ উত্তর: মিলারের কাজ—বালকের টুপি ফেরত দেয়া—একটি কার্যকর ছোট্ট সহৃদয়তা প্রদর্শন। এটি প্যাসেজের মূল ভাবকে সমর্থন করে কারণ এটি দেখায় যে মানুষের মধ্যে এখনও কৃতজ্ঞতা ও আগের অনুগ্রহ মনে রাখার ক্ষমতা থাকে; মিলার হল সেই ব্যতিক্রমী চরিত্র যিনি 'ভুলে যাওয়া' সমাজের মধ্যে মানবিক স্মৃতিকে রক্ষা করেন। এই কাজটি নদীর স্থির স্মৃতিকে মানবিক স্মৃতির সম্ভাব্য প্রতিস্থাপন হিসেবে তুলে ধরে।

ঘ উত্তর: পুনর্লিখন (উদাহরণ): "প্রবাহ অতীতের পরচিহ্ন বয়ে নিয়ে যায়; গ্রামের মানুষ ছুঁয়েও দেখেন না, কেবল মিলার ফিরিয়ে দেয় এক হারানো স্মৃতি।"

Explanation:
ব্যক্তিত্বদান দ্বারা প্রাকৃতিক উপাদানকে স্মৃতি রাখার ক্ষমতা দেওয়া হয়েছে যাতে পাঠক উপলব্ধি করে যে মানব আচরণ দ্রুত বদলে যায় কিন্তু পরিবেশ, জলের মতো, অতীতের নিদর্শন ধারণ করে। মিলারের ভ্রাতৃত্বপূর্ণ কাজটি প্রতীকী—এটি দেখায় যে ব্যক্তিগত সদয়তা সমাজে কৃতজ্ঞতার স্বল্পতাকে সাময়িকভাবে হলেও প্রতিরোধ করতে পারে। পুনর্লিখনের উদ্দেশ্য ছিল মূল ভাব অপরিবর্তিত রেখে নতুন ভিজ্যুয়াল উদাহরণ যোগ করা।

Question:
I sit above an empty subway station
The fluorescent saints hum and flicker
Clutching yesterday's newspapers like relics
While the city exhales a long, weary rumor.

At the corner a child counts the seconds of a siren
And a stranger folds his hands around an old grief.
The sky tastes of iron and unspoken promises.

গ. কোন একটি প্রতীক চিহ্নিত কর এবং তার অর্থ ব্যাখ্যা করো।
ঘ. এই দৃশ্যটি কোন সামাজিক বা ঐতিহাসিক অবস্থা নির্দেশ করতে পারে? সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: কেন্দ্রীয় থিম — শহুরে পরিণতির ক্লান্তি ও নাড়া-জাগানো অনিশ্চয়তা: কবিতার দৃশ্যটি ব্যক্তিগত বিষণ্ণতা ও সমগ্র সমাজের উপর ছড়ানো অবনতি/অস্থিরতার মিলিত প্রতিফলন। ব্যাখ্যা: শূন্য সাবওয়ে, ফ্লুরোসেন্ট আলোর “সেন্টস” এবং কাগজপত্রকে স্মৃতিচিহ্ন ভাবা—এই উপাদানগুলো ব্যক্তিগত স্মৃতি ও নিঃসঙ্গতার সঙ্গে সমাজের ক্ষয়কে সংযুক্ত করে।

খ উত্তর: টোন — ক্লান্ত, অবহিতকৃত এবং মেলানকোলিক; বক্তা নিরীক্ষক ও চিন্তাশীল। উদাহরণ: "city exhales a long, weary rumor" ও "the sky tastes of iron and unspoken promises"—এই লাইনগুলো থেকে জানায় বক্তা কেবল ভুক্তভোগী না, বরং সতর্ক পর্যবেক্ষক; আবেগগুলো কাঁপন-শূন্য নয়, বরং শীতল ও অভিজ্ঞতায় ভরা।

গ উত্তর: প্রতীক — "ফ্লুরোসেন্ট সেন্টস/নিয়ন দেবতা" (the fluorescent saints/neon gods): এগুলো আধুনিক ট্রাম্পেট-আলো ও ভৃত্যতামূলক উপভোগের প্রতীক; অর্থাৎ প্রযুক্তি/বাণিজ্যিককরণ যে ভাবে মানুষের আধ্যাত্মিকতা এবং সত্যিকারের আলোকে বিকৃত করে তা চিত্রিত করে। পাশাপাশি "কাগজপত্রকে রیلিক্স হিসেবে ধরে থাকা" অতীতকে পবিত্র মনে করার প্রতীক।

ঘ উত্তর: সামাজিক/ঐতিহাসিক অবস্থা — এক ধরণের পরবর্তী-আধুনিক বা নগরীয় অবক্ষয়: অর্থনৈতিক সংকট, সামাজিক বিচ্ছিন্নতা এবং রাজনৈতিক উদাসীনতার ফলাফল। সংক্ষেপে, উপন্যাস/কাব্যিক দৃশ্যটি একটি শহরের যৌথ হতাশা ও নিরাপত্তাহীনতার সময়কাল নির্দেশ করে, যেখানে সাধারণ মানুষ ছোট্‌-ছোট্‌ ক্ষুদ্র প্রতিরোধ ও স্মৃতি ধরে রাখছে।

Explanation:
এই সমাধানগুলো কবিতার প্রতীক, টোন ও থিমগুলোর পারস্পরিক সম্পর্ক বিশ্লেষণ করে। থিম নির্ধারণে দৃশ্যের উপাদান (শূন্য সাবওয়ে, ক্লান্ত ফ্লুরোসেন্ট আলো) ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে। টোন নির্ণয়ে ভাষার ছন্দ ও চিত্র (weary, unspoken promises) ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে। প্রতীক বেছে নিয়ে তার বহুস্তরীয় অর্থ—টেকনোক্র্যাটিক আলো বনাম আধ্যাত্মিক ক্ষয়—ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়েছে। সামাজিক/ঐতিহাসিক ব্যাখ্যায় নগরায়ন, অর্থনৈতিক ও মানসিক বিচ্ছিন্নতার রূপায়ণকে সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে উল্লেখ করা হয়েছে।

Question:
On the rooftop the radio mutters old election slogans
A flock of pigeons maps the cracked skyline
Glass towers hide their reflections in blind suits
As children trade trinkets for stories of vanished summers.

The air carries a metallic hush — like the pause before factories close.
An old woman counts coins and names the wars that never ended.

Options:
ক. এই অংশের কেন্দ্রীয় বার্তা কী?
খ. লেখকের কোন রূপক (metaphor) সবচেয়ে কার্যকর মনে হয় এবং কেন?
গ. বক্তার দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি (point of view) কী এবং সেটি কিভাবে পাঠকের অনুভূতিকে প্রভাবিত করে?
ঘ. একটি লাইন বেছে নিয়ে সেটির ভঙ্গি (mood) বিশ্লেষণ করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: কেন্দ্রীয় বার্তা — রাজনৈতিক প্রতিশ্রুতি ও অর্থনৈতিক উন্নতির খোলসের আড়ালে মানুষের বহুবিধ ক্ষয় ও স্মৃতি হারানো। রেডিওর পুরোনো স্লোগান, ট্রেডিং শিশু ও অপর্যাপ্ত জীবিকার চিত্র সবই দেখায় যে সরকারি বা কর্পোরেট কথাবার্তা বাস্তব মানুষের জীবনের সমস্যাগুলো ঢেকে রাখে।

খ উত্তর: রূপক — "glass towers hide their reflections in blind suits" সবচেয়ে কার্যকর। কেননা এটি কর্পোরেট অস্বচ্ছতা ও দৃষ্টি নষ্ট করার চিত্র দেয়: কাঁচের টাওয়ার (আধুনিক ক্ষমতা/ধনী প্রতিষ্ঠান) নিজেদের প্রতিফলন লুকায়, যেন তারা দায়িত্বের দৃষ্টিকোণ থেকে অন্ধ। এটি ক্ষমতা, দূরত্ব ও অনুক্ষুব্দতার সমাহার ঘটায়।

গ উত্তর: দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি — তৃতীয় পুরুষ, কিন্তু ঘনিষ্ঠ পর্যবেক্ষক (omniscient-limited observer): লেখক বহুধা দৃশ্য দেখায়—রেডিও, পাখি, শিশুরা, বুড়ো নারী—কিন্তু প্রতিটি উপাদান সম্পর্কে সূক্ষ্ম মনস্তাত্ত্বিক পর্যবেক্ষণ করে। পাঠকের ওপর প্রভাব: এটি একটি বন্দিঘরের অনুভূতি দেয়—পাঠক সবাইকে দেখতে পায়, তাদের নিঃশব্দ কষ্ট অনুভব করে, ফলে সমবেদনার জন্ম হয়।

ঘ উত্তর: লাইন বিশ্লেষণ — "The air carries a metallic hush — like the pause before factories close." ভঙ্গি (mood): উদ্বিগ্ন, প্রত্যাশিত নীরবতা। ধাতব (metallic) শব্দটি কড়া ও শীতল অনুভূতি দেয়; "pause before factories close" উপমাটি ভবিষ্যৎ সংকট ও চাকরি-ক্ষয়ের অচেনা ভয়কে উদ্রেক করে। সামগ্রিকভাবে এটি অনিশ্চয়তার নীরব চাপ সৃষ্টি করে।

Explanation:
উত্তরগুলোতে টেক্সটের প্রতীক ও ভাষা বিশ্লেষণ করে থিম, রূপক ও ভঙ্গি ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়েছে। কেন্দ্রীয় বার্তা পর্যবেক্ষণমূলক উপাদান থেকে উঠে আসে; রূপক নির্বাচন করার সময় চিত্রটির বহুমাত্রিকতা বিবেচনা করা হয়েছে; দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি ও ভঙ্গি বিশ্লেষণে কিভাবে ভাষা পাঠকের অনুভূতির ওপর প্রভাব ফেলে তা দেখানো হয়েছে।

Question:
Night market closes like a heavy book
Neon confessions blur into puddles of regret
A soldier returns with a ribbon of ash on his sleeve
While lovers keep their windows shut against the news.

Somewhere a clock forgets the year.

Options:
ক. এই দৃশ্যে প্রধান দ্বন্দ্ব কী ধরনের — ব্যক্তিগত বনাম সামাজিক, নৈতিক বনাম বাস্তবিক, অর্থনৈতিক ইত্যাদি? সংজ্ঞায়িত করো।
খ. "neon confessions" এবং "ribbon of ash"—এই দুটি ইমেজ কীভাবে একে অপরের সঙ্গে কাজ করে?
গ. এই কাব্যিক অংশে কোন ধরনের শব্দচয়ন (diction) ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে এবং তা কীভাবে ভঙ্গি প্রভাবিত করে?
ঘ. এই অংশটিকে একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত শিরোনাম দাও যা থিমকে ক্যাপচার করে।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: প্রধান দ্বন্দ্ব — ব্যক্তিগত বনাম সামাজিক (individual vs. collective trauma) এবং নৈতিক বনাম বাস্তবিক (moral conscience vs. harsh reality)—দুটি স্তরেই কাজ করে। ব্যাখ্যা: প্রেমিকেরা জানালা বন্ধ করে ব্যক্তিগত শান্তি খোঁজে, কিন্তু সৈনিকের ছেঁড়া রিবন ও বাজারের অনুতাপ দেখায় যে সামগ্রিক রাজনৈতিক/সামাজিক অশান্তি ব্যক্তিগত জীবনে অনিবার্যভাবে ঢুকে পড়েছে।

খ উত্তর: সম্পর্ক ও কার্যকারিতা — "neon confessions" (বাণিজ্যিক আলোয় প্রকাশিত অস্বস্তিকর সত্য/স্বীকার) ও "ribbon of ash" (যুদ্ধে/হিংসায় ছেঁড়া ক্ষতি ও মৃতদেহের স্মৃতি) একত্রে আধুনিক গ্ল্যামার বনাম ধ্বংসের সমন্বয় করে। প্রথমটি সজীব কিন্তু নগণ্য, দ্বিতীয়টি দূর্বল কিন্তু স্থায়ী; একথা দেখায় যে প্রচলিত সামাজিক কথ্য ও চকচকে মুখোশের পেছনে ভয়াবহ বাস্তব রয়েছে।

গ উত্তর: শব্দচয়ন — সংক্ষিপ্ত, চিত্রময় ও ইমেজ-নির্ভর diction: শব্দগুলো (e.g., "heavy book", "neon confessions", "ribbon of ash", "forgets the year") সরাসরি না হয়ে সংকেত দেয়—আবহ এবং অস্পষ্ট উদ্বেগ তৈরি করে। এই কড়া, সংক্ষিপ্ত কথন ভঙ্গি করে মেলানকোলিয়া ও ভীত-শিথিল মুড, যা পাঠককে অবস্থা অনুমান করতে প্ররোচিত করে।

ঘ উত্তর: সংক্ষিপ্ত শিরোনাম — "Bright Lies, Quiet Ashes" (চকচকে মিথ্যে, নীরব ছাই)। এই শিরোনামটি কাব্যের মূল থিম—বহির্ভুত ঝলকানি ও অন্তর্গত ক্ষতির সংমিশ্রণ—ধরা দেয়।

Explanation:
প্রতিটি উত্তর টেক্সটের ইমেজ, শব্দচয়ন ও বিষয়বস্তুকে সংযুক্ত করে বিশ্লেষণ করেছে। দ্বন্দ্ব নিরূপণে ব্যক্তিগত ও সামাজিক স্তরের ঝমকানি দেখানো হয়েছে; ইমেজ-জোড়ায় কিভাবে গ্ল্যামার ও ক্ষয় একসাথে কাজ করে তা ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়েছে; diction বিশ্লেষণে পাঠকের ওপর তার প্রভাব স্পষ্ট করা হয়েছে; এবং শিরোনাম নির্বাচন থিম সংহত করে।

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:
The line graph illustrates the percentage of child labourers engaged in three occupations—Domestic service, Street vending and Manufacturing—in country Z at four benchmark years: 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015. Use this scenario to answer the sub-questions below.

Options:
ক. Write a 150-word description summarizing the main trends and notable changes shown in the graph.
খ. Which sector experienced the fastest increase between 2007 and 2011? Provide the numerical change.
গ. Calculate the overall percentage-point change for each sector from 2003 to 2015 (show calculations).
ঘ. Suggest two plausible causes for the observed shifts between sectors and propose one short-term and one long-term policy measure to reduce child labour.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: The graph shows that in 2003 manufacturing accounted for the largest share of child labour (about 45%), followed by domestic service (30%) and street vending (25%). By 2007 manufacturing had declined slightly while street vending began to rise. Between 2007 and 2011 there was a sharp redistribution: manufacturing fell markedly to around 27%, while both domestic service and street vending climbed to roughly 35% and 38% respectively. By 2015 domestic service reached about 40%, street vending dipped slightly to 32%, and manufacturing stabilized near 28%. Overall, the major trend is a shift of child labour away from manufacturing into service-oriented, informal occupations—especially domestic work and street vending—over the period.

খ Answer: Street vending experienced the fastest increase between 2007 and 2011.
- 2007: 30% → 2011: 38% → Change = +8 percentage points.
(Domestic service rose by +7 points in the same period; manufacturing decreased.)

গ Answer: Overall percentage-point changes 2003 → 2015 (showing simple subtraction):
- Domestic service: 2003 = 30%, 2015 = 40% → Change = 40% − 30% = +10 percentage points.
- Street vending: 2003 = 25%, 2015 = 32% → Change = 32% − 25% = +7 percentage points.
- Manufacturing: 2003 = 45%, 2015 = 28% → Change = 28% − 45% = −17 percentage points.

ঘ Answer: Two plausible causes:
1) Structural economic change: growth of informal services and decline or automation in small-scale manufacturing pushed children into street-based and domestic roles.
2) Household poverty and migration: families shifting to cities or losing stable agricultural income may put children into flexible, informal work.
Policies:
- Short-term: Implement targeted cash-transfer or conditional stipend programs to the poorest households (conditional on school attendance) to immediately reduce the economic incentive for child labour.
- Long-term: Invest in free, quality compulsory education and vocational pathways for adolescents, combined with labour inspections and stronger enforcement of minimum-age laws to sustainably reduce child labour.

Explanation:
For (ক) the description highlights relative sizes and the shift over time: manufacturing declines while services rise. For (খ) we compare numerical changes between 2007 and 2011 and identify the largest increase (+8 points for street vending). For (গ) percentage-point changes are simple subtractions of start and end values. For (ঘ) the causes combine macro (economic structure, migration) and micro (poverty) factors; policy suggestions include immediate income support to families and long-term investments in education and enforcement—both commonly recommended, evidence-based measures to reduce child labour.

Question:
A clustered bar chart compares the proportion of youth employment (ages 15–24) across three sectors—Agriculture, Industry and IT Services—in country A at three points: 2010, 2015 and 2020. Use this context to answer the items below.

Options:
ক. Summarize the main trends in about 120–150 words, highlighting shifts between sectors over the decade.
খ. Which sector showed a continuous rise across all three years? Give the figures.
গ. Calculate the average annual change in the agriculture share between 2010 and 2020, showing the arithmetic step (use [math] tags for the calculation).
ঘ. Name two implications of these shifts for education and vocational training policy.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: The chart indicates that agriculture was the dominant employer of young people in 2010, with approximately 55% of youth working in that sector, while industry accounted for about 25% and IT services 20%. By 2015 agriculture’s share had declined to roughly 45%, with industry increasing to 30% and IT services to 25%. The trend continued to 2020: agriculture fell further to around 35%, industry edged up slightly to 33%, and IT services rose to 32%. Overall the decade shows a steady movement away from agricultural employment toward industry and particularly fast-growing IT services, suggesting structural diversification and an increasing role for tech-oriented jobs among young workers.

খ Answer: IT Services showed a continuous rise across all three years: 2010 = 20% → 2015 = 25% → 2020 = 32% (net increase of 12 percentage points over the decade).

গ Answer: Average annual change for agriculture share from 2010 to 2020:
[math]\text{Change} = 35\% - 55\% = -20\%\text{ (percentage points)}[/math]
[math]\text{Average annual change} = \dfrac{-20\%}{10\ \text{years}} = -2\%\ \text{points per year}[/math]
So agriculture declined on average by 2 percentage points per year.

ঘ Answer: Two policy implications:
1) Curriculum and skills shift: Expand digital literacy, coding basics, and soft skills in secondary education to prepare youth for IT and industry roles.
2) Vocational pathways and apprenticeships: Strengthen technical and vocational training linked to industry demand (manufacturing technologies, maintenance, IT support) and create partnerships with employers for apprenticeships to smooth the transition from school to non-agricultural jobs.

Explanation:
For (ক) the summary tracks proportions at three dates and stresses the movement from agriculture toward industry and IT. For (খ) we simply list the IT percentages that rise in each period. For (গ) the arithmetic divides the total change by the number of years, so we used [math] tags to show the subtraction and division steps. For (ঘ) policies follow directly from the labor shift: educational content must match labor demand and vocational/apprenticeship systems help place youth into growing sectors.

Question:
A stacked bar chart shows average weekly hours worked by child labourers (ages 6–14) in 2016 across three regions—North, South and East—broken into Agriculture, Mining and Household chores. The totals and sector splits are: North total 35h (Agriculture 20, Mining 5, Household 10), South total 30h (Agriculture 15, Mining 10, Household 5), East total 40h (Agriculture 18, Mining 12, Household 10). Use this setup to answer the questions below.

Options:
ক. Describe the main regional differences and noteworthy features in about 80–100 words.
খ. Which region has the highest proportion of its hours in mining? Show percentage calculations for each region and identify the highest.
গ. If policymakers aim to reduce total weekly hours in the East by 25%, how many hours must be removed? Suggest which sector(s) should be targeted to minimize impacts on schooling and give a brief rationale. Show the calculation using [math] tags.
ঘ. Recommend an effective way to present this data to the public (type of chart and two presentation tactics) to maximize understanding and spur action.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: The chart shows clear regional variation. East has the highest overall burden at 40 hours per week, with a relatively large mining component (12h). North has 35 hours, dominated by agriculture (20h) and a moderate share of household chores (10h). South records the lowest total (30h) but has the largest mining share proportionally (10h out of 30h) and the smallest household component (5h). In short, agriculture dominates in North, mining is relatively important in South and East, and household chores are fairly constant in North and East.

খ Answer: Percentage of total hours spent in mining by region (Mining hours ÷ Total hours × 100):
- North: [math]\dfrac{5}{35}\times100\approx14.29\%[/math]
- South: [math]\dfrac{10}{30}\times100\approx33.33\%[/math]
- East: [math]\dfrac{12}{40}\times100=30\%[/math]
Therefore South has the highest proportion of mining hours (≈33.3%).

গ Answer: Target reduction: East total = 40 hours. A 25% reduction equals:
[math]0.25\times40=10\ \text{hours}[/math]
So policymakers must remove 10 hours, leaving a new total of 30 hours per week.
Recommendation on sector targeting: Prioritize reducing mining hours because mining in the East is 12h and often involves hazardous, irregular shifts that conflict with schooling. For example, reduce mining by 8 hours and agriculture by 2 hours (12→4 and 18→16) to reach the 10-hour cut while preserving some family agricultural time. This approach minimizes disruption of basic domestic needs while removing the most harmful hours from dangerous work.

ঘ Answer: Presentation recommendation:
1) Use a stacked bar chart (as given) combined with an adjacent percentage-bar or pie chart to show sector shares per region—this makes both absolute hours and relative composition clear.
2) Two tactics: (a) add simple callouts/highlight boxes showing key messages (e.g., "East: 40h/week — highest"; "South: 33% mining"), and (b) include a short infographic with recommended actions and one-sentence policy implications to make the data actionable for the public and policymakers.

Explanation:
For (ক) the description contrasts totals and sector dominance across regions. For (খ) we compute mining share by dividing mining hours by total hours for each region, using [math] notation to show the fractions and percentages. For (গ) 25% of 40 is 10 hours; recommending reductions in mining prioritizes removal of the most hazardous and schooling-disruptive work—hence the suggested allocation of cuts. For (ঘ) effective public presentation combines clear visual comparison (stacked bars and percentages) with textual callouts and action-oriented infographics to prompt understanding and policy attention.

ঘ প্যারাফ্রেইজ: "আমি শহর ছেড়ে চলে যাবো। পাথুরে কভে একটি ছোট নৌঘর বানাবো যেখানে নোনতা সমুদ্রের গন্ধ লাগবে এবং একটাই লণ্ঠন নিভৃতে জ্বালবে; ঢেউ আর পাখির কোলাহল আমাকে সারাটাই শান্তি দেবে।"

Explanation:
Solution note: ক (theme) captures the speaker's wish to exchange urban complexity for elemental simplicity. খ (images) focuses on concrete sensory details—visual (waves, light) and tactile/olfactory (salt)—and explains how each deepens mood. গ classifies the phrase as a tactile sensory image (not a metaphor or simile); it evokes bodily sensation. ঘ provides a plain-language paraphrase preserving imagery and tone so the meaning is clear.

Question:
Under high moorland skies a narrator plans a tiny heather hut where morning mists will thread through the gorse, and distant sheep-bells will mark the day. The extract emphasizes slow time, small labors like tending a single hearth, and an intimacy with winds and calls from ridge and stone.

Options:
ক. এই অনুচ্ছেদের টোন বা মুড কী এবং তা কীভাবে তৈরি হয়েছে উল্লেখ করো।
খ. ''sheep-bells'' এবং ''hearth''—এই দুটি শব্দের প্রতীকি অর্থ (symbolic meaning) কী হতে পারে? সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করো।
গ. যদি এই অনুচ্ছেদে রেফ্রেন (আবৃত্তি) থাকে, তার কার্যকারিতা কী হবে? একটি সম্ভাব্য আবৃত্তির উদাহরণ দাও (ইংরেজি বা বাংলায় একটি লাইনের মত)।
ঘ. এই অনুচ্ছেদ থেকে একটি লাইন নিয়ে সেটির ভাবানুবাদ (interpretive paraphrase) করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক টোন/মুড: শান্ত, স্থির এবং অন্তর্মুখী—উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে ধীর ও contemplative। এটি হালকা নস্টালজিয়া ও নিরাপত্তার আকাঙ্খা দিয়ে গঠিত, যা শব্দচয়ন (mist, hearth, bells), ধীর ক্রিয়াপদ এবং প্রকৃতির নরম ছন্দ দ্বারা প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয়।

খ প্রতীকি অর্থ: "sheep-bells"—দৈনন্দিন, আগমনকারী সময়ের নরম ধারক; জীবনের নিয়মিত ছন্দ বা গ্রামের রুটিনের প্রতীক। "hearth"—অর্থাৎ মনে ও ঘরে উষ্ণতা, পরিবার বা অভয়ারণ্য; একাকিত্বে হলেও নিরাপত্তা ও গৃহসাধারণের অনুভূতি ধরে রাখে।

গ রেফ্রেনের কার্যকারিতা: রেফ্রেন পাঠকে আবৃত্তির মাধ্যমে আশ্রয় ও স্থিতিশীলতার অনুভূতিতে রাখে; এটি মূল আকাঙ্খাকে বারবার জোর দেয়। উদাহরণ (ইংরেজি): "I will stay where the bell calls me back." বা বাংলায়: "বেল বাজে, আমি ফিরে থাকব।"—এমন একটি লাইন বারবার বললে আবৃত্তির শান্তি তৈরি হবে।

ঘ লাইন ও ভাবানুবাদ উদাহরণ: উক্ত লাইন: "morning mists will thread through the gorse" — ভাবানুবাদ: "ভোরের কুয়াশা কেঁচে কেঁচে ঝোপের মধ্যে ছড়িয়ে যাবে," অর্থাৎ ভোরে নরম কুয়াশা ধীরে ধীরে ঝোপ-গুচ্ছের ফাঁকে ছড়িয়ে দিয়ে প্রকৃতিকে কোমল করে তুলবে।

Explanation:
Explanation: ক — mood deduced from diction and imagery; quiet, contemplative language (mist, hearth, bells) yields a tranquil tone. খ — symbolic reading links objects to broader themes: rhythm of life and domestic safety. গ — refrains emphasize resolve and create ritualized calm; example lines show how repetition would function. ঘ — paraphrase demonstrates how to translate poetic image into plain language while retaining nuance.

Question:
A poet speaks of planting three apple-trees in a sun-dim orchard and letting seasons do the rest: blossoms, bees, and quiet winters are all embraced. The speaker repeats a short promise, imagines the orchard's sounds, and feels the decision rooted in hope rather than escape.

Options:
ক. এই অনুচ্ছেদের কেন্দ্রীয় থিম কী? একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত বাক্যে বলো।
খ. লক্ষ্য করো—কোন শব্দ/লাইন থেকে বোঝা যায় যে বক্তা 'পালানো' নয় বরং 'নির্মাণ' বা 'সংরক্ষণ' করতে চায়? লাইনটি উদ্ধৃত করে ব্যাখ্যা করো।
গ. "bees in the blossom"—এই ইমেজটি কীভাবে সময়ের ধারাবাহিকতা (seasonality) বোঝায়? ব্যাখ্যা করো।
ঘ. এই অনুচ্ছেদ থেকে একটি বিকল্প শেষ লাইন লিখো যা মূল থিম বজায় রেখে একটি নতুন ইমেজ যোগ করে (একটি সারল্যপূর্ণ ভঙ্গিতে)।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক কেন্দ্রীয় থিম: জীবনকে ধীরে ধীরে গড়ার, প্রকৃতির ছন্দে মিশে স্থায়ী সান্ত্বনা ও আশা প্রতিষ্ঠার সিদ্ধান্ত।

খ উদ্ধৃতি ও ব্যাখ্যা: লাইন: "I will plant three trees and stay to watch them grow." — এই বাক্য স্পষ্টত্ 'পালানো' নয় বরং সহধর্মীভাবে কিছু নির্মাণ ও যত্ন করার ইচ্ছাকে প্রকাশ করে; এখানে স্থাপন এবং অপেক্ষার ইঙ্গিত আছে, পালানোর সঙ্কেত নেই।

গ ব্যাখ্যা: "bees in the blossom" ইমেজটি সরাসরি বসন্তকালীন ঘটনার ওপর আলোকপাত করে—ফুল ফোটা, মৌমাছি কাজ করা—এবং এটি একটি চক্রের অংশ হিসেবে ফসল ও পরিণতি (পোলিনেশন থেকে ফল) বোঝায়। এই ক্রিয়া বসন্ত থেকে গ্রীষ্ম, এবং পরবর্তীতে শরৎ ও শীত—সমস্ত ঋতু জুড়ে ধারাবাহিক সময়গত পরিবর্তনকে ইঙ্গিত করে।

ঘ বিকল্প শেষ লাইন (নতুন ইমেজ): "I will stay, and let the seasons weave their slow gold through the branches."

Explanation:
Explanation: ক isolates the overarching idea of constructing a life in tune with nature. খ points to explicit phrasing that shows commitment and care rather than flight. গ explains how a single sensory image (bees in blossoms) implies a seasonal sequence and ecological process. ঘ offers a new closing line that preserves the theme—staying and seasonal transformation—while introducing the visual image of 'slow gold' to suggest leaves, fruit, or sunlight.

Question:
On the salt-sprayed cliff a small chorus rises:

"Bring me no gold nor silver plate,
Only the gulls to wheel and skate,
And the wind to braid my hair,
And a sky that's stripped and bare.

Come down, come down, come down to me!
Here I trade the city's key
For the ringing of the sea."

Options:
ক. এই অনুচ্ছেদের কেন্দ্রীয় ভাব বা থিম কী?
খ. বক্তার মনোভাবকে সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করো।
গ. কোন দুটি চিত্রকল্প/ইমেজরি ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে এবং সেগুলোর প্রভাব কী?
ঘ. যদি এই অনুচ্ছেদের আধুনিক দৈনন্দিন জীবনে একটি সমতুল্য নিদর্শন দিতে হয়, কী হতে পারে?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক কেন্দ্রীয় থিম: শহুরে জীবন ও সম্পত্তির পরিবর্তে প্রাকৃতিক জীবনের সরলতা ও মুক্তির আকাঙ্ক্ষা—নগরী সম্পদের বদলে সমুদ্র, বায়ু ও মুক্ত আকাশকে মূল্যায়ন করা।

খ বক্তার মনোভাব: উদার এবং মুক্তিসঞ্চারী; বক্তা শান্তি, স্বাধীনতা ও প্রাকৃতিক সান্নিধ্যকে প্রাধান্য দিচ্ছে এবং শহরের জটিলতা ও ভোগ-বিলাস ত্যাগ করতে ইচ্ছুক। মনোভাবটা আবেগপ্রবণ কিন্তু স্থির সংকল্পসহকারে।

গ ব্যবহৃত চিত্রকল্প/ইমেজরি:
1) "গলস্‌ to wheel and skate" — সমুদ্রপাখির ঘূর্ণায়মান, মুক্ত উড়ানের চিত্র; শুনার মাধ্যমে স্বচ্ছন্দতা ও প্রাকৃতিক গতির বোঝাপড়া বৃদ্ধি করে।
2) "wind to braid my hair" — ব্যক্তিগত ও সংবেদনশীল একটি চিত্র, যেটি বাতাসকে সক্রিয় কর্মদক্ষ হিসেবে উপস্থাপন করে; পাঠকে বক্তার সরল, মৃদু আনন্দের সাথে সংযুক্ত করে।
এই ইমেজগুলো মিলিয়ে পাঠকে প্রাকৃতিক জীবনের স্পন্দিত সৌন্দর্য ও মুক্তির অনুভূতিতে নিয়োজিত করে।

ঘ আধুনিক সমতুল্য: শহুরে অ্যাপার্টমেন্ট-জীবন ত্যাগ করে সমুদ্রতটের ছোট কটেজে বা কুটিরে চলে যাওয়া; অথবা ডিজিটাল ডিটক্স—সোশ্যাল মিডিয়া, কাজের ইমেইল বন্ধ করে প্রকৃতির সঙ্গে সময় কাটানো।

Explanation:
উপরের উত্তরের ব্যাখ্যা: প্রথমে আমরা মূল থিম নির্ধারণ করেছি—শহুরে বস্তুবাদীর বদলে প্রাকৃতিক সরলতা। এরপর বক্তার মনোভাবের ভাষাগত সূচক (যেমন 'Come down...Here I trade') বিশ্লেষণ করে নির্দিষ্ট করা হয়েছে যে বক্তা আত্মপ্রত্যয়ী ও শান্তিপ্রিয়। চিত্রকল্প বিশ্লেষণে কিভাবে শব্দাবলি শ্রোতাকে দৃশ্যমান ও আবেগগতভাবে সংযুক্ত করে তা ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়েছে। শেষ অংশে আধুনিক জীবনের প্রাসঙ্গিক উদাহরণ দেওয়া হয়েছে যাতে পাঠক ধারণাটিকে বাস্তব জীবনের সিদ্ধান্তের সঙ্গে মিলিয়ে দেখতে পারে।

Question:
Beneath the lantern-lit orchard a soft refrain:

"We till the soil with honest hands,
Plant our trust where root-command,
Trim the boughs and let fruits fall,
Not for market but to call
Neighbors near, neighbors dear,
To taste the year we've grown here."

Options:
ক. এই অংশের প্রধান বার্তা কী?
খ. পাঠ্য থেকে সমাজবদ্ধতার কোন দিকটি প্রতীয়মান হচ্ছে? উদাহরণসহ ব্যাখ্যা করো।
গ. পঙক্তিগুলোতে কোন শব্দচয়ন (diction) বা ভাষার ধরন বার্তাকে কিভাবে শক্তিশালী করেছে?
ঘ. এই অনুচ্ছেদের একটি সম্ভাব্য শিরোনাম কী দেওয়া যেতে পারে?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক প্রধান বার্তা: সাম্প্রদায়িক পরিশ্রম ও আত্মকৃত ফল ভাগাভাগির মাধ্যমে জীবনের সার্থকতা—অর্থাৎ ব্যক্তিগত লাভের চেয়ে সবার মাঝে ভাগ করে নেওয়ার মূল্যবোধকে উৎসাহিত করা।

খ প্রতীয়মান সমাজবদ্ধতার দিক: পারস্পরিক সহযোগিতা ও স্থানীয় বিনিময় (communal reciprocity)। উদাহরণ: "Not for market but to call / Neighbors near, neighbors dear" — এখানে ফলগুলো বিক্রয় উদ্দেশ্যে নয়, বরং প্রতিবেশীদের আহ্বানের উদ্দেশ্যে রোপণ ও সংগ্রহ করা হচ্ছে; এটি সামাজিক বন্ধন ও সার্বজনীন সেবার প্রতীক।

গ শব্দচয়ন ও ভাষার ধরন: সরল, গ্রামীণ এবং মনোহর ভাষা (e.g., "honest hands", "root-command", "neighbors dear")—এসব শব্দ লোকজ, আন্তরিক টোন তৈরি করে এবং পাঠকে কাজের নৈতিকতা এবং কমিউনিটির ঘনিষ্ঠতায় অভিভুত করে। এছাড়া পুনরাবৃত্তি (neighbors near, neighbors dear) সম্পর্কের গুরুত্বকে জোর দেয়।

ঘ সম্ভাব্য শিরোনাম: "অরচার্ডের বাটুকি: ফসল ও ফোঁটা বন্ধুত্ব" অথবা সংক্ষেপে "ফসল ও প্রতিবেশী"।

Explanation:
উত্তরের ব্যাখ্যায় প্রথমে পাঠ্যের সারমর্ম নিরূপণ করা হয়েছে—কেন এখানে কাজ করা হচ্ছে তার উদ্দেশ্য ব্যক্তিগত নয়, সামাজিক। এরপর নির্দিষ্ট লাইন উদ্ধৃত করে কীভাবে সমাজবদ্ধতা কাজ করছে তা দেখানো হয়েছে। শব্দচয়ন বিশ্লেষণে ভাষার সরলতা ও পুনরাবৃত্তি কিভাবে আবেগ ও নৈতিক টোন জোরদার করে তা ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়েছে। শিরোনাম প্রদানের ক্ষেত্রে মোটিভ ও আবেগকে প্রতিফলিত করার উপায় দেখানো হয়েছে।

Question:
On a chilly evening by a lamplit lane a traveler hums:

"I carry only a coat and a crust,
A pocket map of roads I trust,
Stars overhead and a hostel's door,
Tales enough to ask for more.

Walk on, walk on, with steady pace,
The world is wide—so is grace."

ক. এই অনুচ্ছেদ থেকে আলোচিত জীবনধারার কোন দিকটি উঠে এসেছে?
খ. বক্তার কোন মূল্য বা নীতিকে সর্বাধিক গুরুত্ব দিচ্ছে? ব্যাখ্যা করো।
গ. লাইন 'The world is wide—so is grace' কী ধরনের সাহিত্যিক উপায় (figure of speech) এবং তার অর্থ কী?
ঘ. এই অনুচ্ছেদের ভিত্তিতে একজন ছোট গল্পের জন্য একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত কাহিনি-ধারণা (2-3 বাক্যে) লিখো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক জীবনের উদারতা ও ভ্রমণপ্রিয়তা—অল্প সামগ্রী নিয়ে পথচলা, অভিজ্ঞতা সংগৃহীত করা এবং পরিবর্তনকে আলিঙ্গন করার জীবনধারা উঠে এসেছে।

খ দ্রুততর গুরুত্বপ্রাপ্ত মূল্য: আত্মনিষ্ঠা সহজতা ও বিশ্বাস (self-reliance & trust)। বক্তা সামান্য জিনিসেই সন্তুষ্ট (coat and a crust) এবং নিজের মানচিত্র/পছন্দের পথে বিশ্বাস করে; অতিথ্যতা ও কাহিনী-বিনিময়কেও মর্যাদা দেয়।

গ 'The world is wide—so is grace' একটি সাম্য (parallelism) ও পরোক্ষ উপমা/বৈশিষ্ট্যযুক্ত মোটিফ; এখানে 'wide' এবং 'grace' শব্দদ্বয়ের সমান্তরালতা দিয়ে প্রস্তাবিত হচ্ছে যে বিশ্বের বিস্তৃতি যেমন বহুমাত্রিক, তেমনি করুণা/কৃপাও প্রশস্ত। অর্থত: মহানুভবতা ও সুযোগের পর্যাপ্ততা বিশ্বজুড়ে বিদ্যমান।

ঘ কাহিনি-ধারণা: একটি প্রবীণ ভ্রমণকারী তার পকেট মানচিত্র নিয়ে অচেনা শহরে ঢোকে, প্রতিটি হোস্টেলে তার বদলে দেওয়া ছোট গল্পগুলো সংরক্ষণ করে—শেষে সে বুঝে যে সেই ছোট গল্পগুলিই তার সত্যিকারের সম্পদ, এবং একটি তরুণকে সেগুলো দিয়ে পথ দেখায়।

Explanation:
উত্তরের বিশ্লেষণে প্রথমে জীবনধারার সারমর্ম নির্ধারণ করা হয়েছে—ভ্রাম্যমান ও সহজ জীবন। এরপর বক্তার নৈতিক মূল্য (আত্মনির্ভরতা ও কাহিনী/মানুষের প্রতি বিশ্বাস) ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়েছে। 'World is wide—so is grace' লাইনের সাহিত্যিক প্রযুক্তি ও তা থেকে উদ্ভূত অর্থ বিশ্লেষণ করা হয়েছে—সামঞ্জস্য ও উপমার সমন্বয়ে কি বার্তা আসে তা দেখানো হয়েছে। শেষ অংশে অনুচ্ছেদের মোটিভ ব্যবহার করে সংক্ষিপ্ত কাহিনি-রূপরেখা প্রদান করা হয়েছে যাতে পাঠক কল্পনায় তা সাজাতে পারে।

Question:
A short lyric addresses Autumn as if it were a wandering peddler, asking it to pause and barter its hurry for a single evening. The speaker offers simple household gifts and songs to convince Autumn to tarry, while noting the golden hush that follows each of Autumn’s passages.

Options:
ক. What is the central theme of this lyric?
খ. Identify two literary devices used in the stanza and give a brief textual example for each.
গ. What is the speaker’s attitude toward Autumn? Cite specific phrases from the context to support your answer.
ঘ. Interpret the image “rust-red leaves like coin.” What does this image suggest within the poem’s thematic frame?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The central theme is the desire to arrest transience — a longing to slow down the seasonal (and more broadly temporal) passage so that fleeting beauty and comfort may be savored. The speaker entreats Autumn to stay, trading small gifts for a momentary suspension of change.খ Two literary devices: 1) Personification — Autumn is addressed as a wandering peddler who can 'pause' or 'barter', e.g., treating a season as an agent who can accept offers. 2) Simile/metaphor — the phrase “rust-red leaves like coin” uses a simile to link leaves to money, invoking value and exchange.
গ The speaker’s attitude is pleading and reverent: they beg Autumn to “pause” and offer gifts (“I will stitch you a blanket of songs / and set a kettle on for your rest”), showing both affection for Autumn’s gifts and fear of its swift departure. The respectful bargaining tone indicates admiration mixed with desperation.
ঘ “Rust-red leaves like coin” symbolizes the idea that what seems wasteful or falling (dead leaves) actually has value — each leaf is a token of seasonal wealth: moments, memories, and beauty to be spent or saved. Within the poem’s theme, it frames natural transience as something precious worth negotiating for.

Explanation:
The answers derive from common poetic analysis: asking a natural phenomenon to linger foregrounds human resistance to impermanence (theme). Personification is evident because Autumn is spoken to as an agent who can stay or accept gifts; the simile explicitly compares leaves to coin. The speaker’s tone is deduced from verbs of entreaty and the offered compensations. Finally, likening leaves to coin reframes discardable objects as valuables, reinforcing the speaker’s willingness to barter for time.

Question:
A brief monologue addresses Memory as a lamplighter who passes through rooms, often leaving the speaker in darkness. The speaker pleads for Memory to relight a single lamp so that one remembered afternoon might be fully lived again, promising silence and the keeping of secrets in return.

Options:
ক. Summarize the main idea conveyed by this monologue.
খ. Point out two emotions that dominate the speaker’s voice and provide line-based evidence for each emotion.
গ. How does the image of the lamplighter function allegorically in this context?
ঘ. Suggest a one-sentence paraphrase of the speaker’s bargain with Memory.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The main idea is the speaker’s yearning to re-experience a specific past moment; Memory is addressed as an active force that can restore light (clarity and presence), and the speaker offers to trade quiet and fidelity for that revival.
খ Two dominant emotions: 1) Longing — shown by pleas like “stay your lantern here” and the request to relight “a single afternoon.” 2) Vulnerability/contrition — reflected in promises such as “I will keep your steps a secret” and the willingness to pay with silence, showing the speaker’s openness to humble recompense.
গ Allegorically, the lamplighter represents Memory’s power to illuminate past experiences. When the lamplighter passes, the room (the speaker’s life) goes dark; relighting equates to recollection, clarity, and the emotional reanimation of a past event. It turns an internal cognitive function into a vivid physical action.
ঘ Paraphrase of the bargain: “If you bring back the light of that one remembered afternoon, I will keep silent and guard your presence.”

Explanation:
The monologue frames Memory as an agent whose actions cause emotional light or darkness. The pleas indicate longing; offers of secrecy and silence show humility and a willingness to give something up. The lamplighter metaphor concretizes memory’s selective recall, and the bargain condenses the speaker’s exchange: emotional restoration for devotion or secrecy.

Question:
A compact pastoral addresses Dawn as a traveler who hurries over the hills. The speaker requests Dawn to slow her steps so the dew may linger on the meadow and lovers might tie a ribbon between two trees. In exchange, the speaker promises to let the morning goat graze near Dawn’s path and to whistle a kindly tune.

Options:
ক. What thematic concern does this pastoral express?
খ. Identify one image that conveys urgency and one image that conveys tranquility; explain how each functions within the poem.
গ. What kind of sound devices (alliteration, assonance, etc.) might the poet use to heighten the tone? Give one plausible example based on the lines provided.
ঘ. Offer a brief critical interpretation: why does the speaker offer such small, everyday things in exchange for Dawn’s delay?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The pastoral explores the tension between haste and savoring — a wish to pause beginnings (dawn) to enjoy simple pleasures of life and human connection before routine resumes.
খ Urgency image: “Dawn hurries over the hills” — the verb “hurries” creates forward motion and impatience. Tranquility image: “dew may linger on the meadow” — “dew” and “linger” evoke stillness and gentle preservation. The urgent image sets up the problem; the tranquil image shows what the speaker wants preserved.
গ Sound devices: alliteration could be used to emphasize mood; e.g., repeating the soft 'l' in “let the lingering light” produces a lulling effect suitable to pleading. Alternatively, a rising assonance (long 'o' sounds) in a line about motion—“Dawn rolls on, roads of gold”—could mimic movement.
ঘ The speaker offers humble, everyday gifts because they are authentic, immediate, and within human control; this emphasizes the poem’s grounding in ordinary life and suggests that small attentions and domestic acts can be meaningful currency against the immensity of time or cosmic forces like Dawn.

Explanation:
The pastoral setting naturally raises concerns about tempo of life; images of hurrying versus lingering embody that thematic tension. Sound devices are commonly used to reinforce mood: soft consonants calm, harsher or moving sounds convey motion. The choice of modest offerings underscores the human scale of the plea and the idea that what truly matters is accessible, not grandiose.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর:
ফুড অ্যাডাল্টারেশন হল খাবারের সাথে অনৈতিকভাবে, অবৈধভাবে বা ক্ষতিকরভাবে অপ্রয়োজনীয় বা নিম্নমানের পদার্থ মিশানো, যাতে খাবারের পরিমাণ বাড়ে, রং বা সুবাস বদলে যায়, বা ক্রেতাকে প্রতারিত করা যায়। এটি খাদ্যকে নিরাপদ, পুষ্টিকর এবং খাঁটি হওয়া থেকে দুরে সরিয়ে দেয়।

খ উত্তর:
রাস্তার ধারের খাবারে সাধারণ অ্যাডাল্টারেশনের উপায় (কমপক্ষে পাঁচটি):
1) রঙ বা ডাই মিশানো: কৃত্রিম বা খারাপ ভুলে রঙ যোগ করে ঘি/দই/চটপটি দেখতে আকর্ষণীয় করা।
2) পানি বা সস্তা তরল যোগ করা: দুধ পাতলা করার জন্য পানি বা ভবানী নীমের জল যোগ করা।
3) কমদামি তেল/মলিন তেল ব্যবহার: বিশুদ্ধ ভেজে তেল না রেখে পুরোনো বা হাইড্রোজেনেটেড তেল মিলিয়ে দেওয়া।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর:
স্কুলের 'হেলদি লাঞ্চ' নীতিমালা (প্রধান ৫টি):
1) গ্রহণযোগ্য সরবরাহকারীর তালিকা: লাইসেন্সপ্রাপ্ত, স্বাস্থ্য সার্টিফাইড এবং আনুষঙ্গিক রেফারেন্স থাকা ভেন্ডরদের ব্যবহার।
2) মেনু ও উপকরণ স্বচ্ছতা: সপ্তাহিক মেনু আগে থেকে প্রকাশ ও উপকরণ/অ্যালার্জেন লেবেল অপরিহার্য।
3) স্টোরেজ ও পরিবহন স্ট্যান্ডার্ড: তাপমাত্রা নিয়ন্ত্রিত পরিবহন/স্টোরেজ, আলাদা কাঁচামাল ও রান্না হওয়া আইটেমের জন্য পৃথক ভাড়া।
4) নিয়মিত নমুনা পরীক্ষা ও ইনস্পেকশন: মাসিক বা সাপ্তাহিক সংগৃহীত স্যাম্পল ল্যাব টেস্ট ও স্বাস্থ্য অফিসদের অডিট।
5) অভিযোগ ও প্রতিকার পদ্ধতি: শিক্ষার্থীর স্বাস্থ্য সমস্যা দ্রুত রিপোর্টিং, অভিভাবক নোটিফিকেশন এবং জরুরি প্রতিকার পরিকল্পনা।

খ উত্তর:
খাবার পরিবহন ও স্টোরেজে সাধারণ ভুল (৪টি):
1) অনুপযুক্ত তাপমাত্রা: গরম খাবার গরম রাখা না বা ঠান্ডা খাবার কোল্ড চেইন বজায় না রাখলে ব্যাকটেরিয়া বেড়ে যায়।
2) ক্রস-কন্টামিনেশন: কাঁচা মাংস ও রান্না হওয়া খাবার একই পাত্র/টুলসে রাখা।
3) অনুপযুক্ত প্যাকেজিং: রুক্ষ বা ছিদ্রযুক্ত প্যাকেজিং থেকে ধুলো, পোকা বা ময়লা প্রবেশ করে।
4) দীর্ঘ সময় ধরে স্টোরেজ: মেয়াদোত্তীর্ণ কাঁচামাল বা একাধিক দিনের তৈরি খাবার বজায় রাখলে টক্সিন বা ব্যাকটেরিয়ার বৃদ্ধি।

গ উত্তর:
ভেন্ডর যাচাই করার তিনটি মানদণ্ড ও পদ্ধতি:
1) কাগজপত্র ও লাইসেন্স যাচাই: খাদ্য লাইসেন্স, ট্রেড লাইসেন্স ও স্বাস্থ্য সার্টিফিকেট কপি নেওয়া। (পদ্ধতি: অনলাইন/অফলাইন যাচাই, মুল নথি দেখানো)।
2) রেফারেন্স ও স্যাম্পলিং: অন্যান্য প্রতিষ্ঠানের রেফারেন্স ও সরবরাহকৃত খাবারের টেস্ট স্যাম্পল চাওয়া ও পরীক্ষা করা। (পদ্ধতি: নমুনা সংগ্রহ ও ল্যাব টেস্ট রিপোর্ট দেখা)।
3) হাইজিন ও কিচেন ভিজিট: রান্নাঘর, প্যাকেজিং এলাকা ও কর্মীদের ব্যক্তিগত হাইজিন পর্যবেক্ষণ। (পদ্ধতি: স্থানের ভিজিট ও চেকলিস্ট ফরম ব্যবহার)।

ঘ উত্তর:
শিশুদের নির্দেশিকা (সংক্ষিপ্ত, সহজ):
"হাত ভাল করে ধোও আগে ও পরে খাওয়ার; আলমারিতে রাখা খাবার ছোঁও না যদি তা ঢাকনা ছাড়া; নিজের লাঞ্চ বাক্স শেয়ার করো না; খাওয়ার আগে খাবারের রং বা গন্ধ অস্বাভাবিক মনে হলে শিক্ষককে বলো; খেয়ে অসুস্থ মনে হলে দ্রুত শিক্ষক বা কেয়ার টিমকে জানাও।"

Explanation:
এই সমাধানটি কার্যকর এবং স্কুল-নির্দিষ্ট: নীতিমালা অংশে প্রশাসনিক ও অডিটিং ব্যবস্থা দেওয়া হয়েছে, কারণ স্কুল পরিবেশে সিস্টেম্যাটিক নিয়ম খুব প্রয়োজন। পরিবহন ও স্টোরেজে যে ভুলগুলোকে প্রধান কারণ হিসেবে ধরা হয়েছে সেগুলো সাধারণত ব্যাকটেরিয়া বৃদ্ধির প্রধান উৎস—এগুলো সহজে চিহ্নিত ও প্রতিরোধযোগ্য। ভেন্ডর যাচাইয়ে কাগজপত্র, রেফারেন্স/স্যাম্পল টেস্ট ও কিচেন ভিজিট—এই তিনটি মিললে সরবরাহকারীর যোগ্যতা নির্ধারণ করা যায়। ছাত্র-নির্দেশিকা ছোট, স্পষ্ট ও বাস্তবসম্মত, যাতে শিশুরা সহজেই মেনে চলতে পারে।

A regional spice manufacturer is accused by consumer groups of mixing fillers into turmeric and chili powder to increase profit. The company denies wrongdoing and offers to cooperate with authorities. Consumers want to know how to confirm adulteration and what legal/technical routes are available.

Options:
ক. এই ঘটনার নৈতিক ও আইনগত বিষয়গুলো কী হবে—সংক্ষেপে বর্ণনা করো (কমপক্ষে তিনটি পয়েন্ট)।
খ. সাধারণ ভোক্তা কোন কোন নিরাপদ ঘরোয়া পরীক্ষার মাধ্যমে সন্দেহজনক মশলার আডাল্টারেশন শনাক্ত করতে পারে? (খুবই সাধারণ ও ঝুঁকিমুক্ত পরীক্ষা ৪টি বলো)।
গ. ল্যাবভিত্তিক কোন পরীক্ষা/প্রযুক্তি দিয়ে স্পষ্ট প্রমান পাওয়া যায়? (কমপক্ষে তিনটি পদ্ধতি ও কী ধরণের উপসর্গ/বিষাক্ত পদার্থ শনাক্ত করা যায় তা লিখো)।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর:
নীতিবিদ্যা ও আইনগত দিকগুলো:
1) ভোক্তা প্রতারণা ও ভোক্তা অধিকার লঙ্ঘন: কোম্পানি যদি অনৈতিকভাবে ফিলার মিশিয়ে থাকে, তা ভোক্তার অর্থনৈতিক ও স্বাস্থ্যগত অধিকার হরণ করে—ভোক্তা আইনে মামলা ও প্রতিকার দাবি হতে পারে।
2) খাদ্য সেফটি স্ট্যান্ডার্ড লঙ্ঘন: অনুমোদিত মান/আইএস/ফুড সেফটি আইন ভঙ্গ হলে রেজিস্ট্রেশন বাতিল, জরিমানা ও উৎপাদন-প্রতিবন্ধের ব্যবস্থা নেওয়া যেতে পারে।
3) দায় ও ক্ষতিপূরণ: স্বাস্থ্যহানির প্রমাণ থাকলে কোম্পানিকে ক্ষতিপূরণ, রেকল পদক্ষেপ ও ক্রেতা ক্ষতিপূরণ দিতে হতে পারে।

খ উত্তর:
নিরাপদ ঘরোয়া পরীক্ষাগুলো (ঝুঁকিমুক্ত ও সহজ):
1) চাক্ষুষ ও স্পর্শক পরীক্ষা: গন্ধ বা রং অস্বাভাবিক, দানা-দার বা বালি-মোটামুটি কণার উপস্থিতি দেখা—কাগজে ঘষে রঙ রক্তা হলে টেক্সটাইল ডাই থাকতে পারে।
2) গরম পানি ফেনা পরীক্ষাঃ একটি চামুচ মশলা গরম পানিতে মিশিয়ে দেখো—অতিরিক্ত ফিলার বা কাগজ/চক দেখা গেলে অবিচ্ছিন্ন কণা পরে যায়।
3) ছাঁকনি/সীভ পরীক্ষা: এক চামুচ নমুনা জলে মিশিয়ে ছাঁকনি দিয়ে ছেঁকে দেখলে ভিন্ন ধাঁচের কণা, বালি বা ইটের ধুলো ধরা পড়ে।
4) ঠোঁট/জিহ্বায় স্বাদ/রঙ পরীক্ষা না করা: রং বা স্বাদ বিশ্রী হলে লেবেল বা বিক্রেতায় প্রশ্ন করে, দ্রুত স্বাস্থ্যসরকারী সংস্থায় নমুনা পাঠানোর পরামর্শ।
(নোট: ঘরোয়া পরীক্ষাগুলো নিশ্চিত প্রমাণ দেয় না; সন্দেহ পেলে অফিসিয়াল ল্যাবে পাঠাতে হবে। কেমিক্যাল আচরণ/জ্বলনধর্মী বা রিফাইনিং পরীক্ষার মতো ঝুঁকিপূর্ণ পরীক্ষা বাড়িতে করা ঠিক নয়)।

গ উত্তর:
ল্যাবভিত্তিক নির্ভরযোগ্য পরীক্ষা/প্রযুক্তি:
1) থিন-লেয়ার ক্রোমাটোগ্রাফি (TLC) বা HPLC: মশলার রংদেইয়ার/বৈধ কম্পোনেন্ট শনাক্ত করে—কৃত্রিম রঙ বা ডাই ও কিছু কনজার্ভেটিভ শনাক্ত হয়।
2) এ্যাটমিক অ্যাবসর্পশন স্পেকট্রোফটোমেট্রি (AAS) বা ICP-MS: ভারী ধাতু (যেমন সীসা, ক্রোমিয়াম) উপস্থিতি মাপার জন্য।
3) টি-এলসি/গ্যাস ক্রোমাটোগ্রাফি-ম্যাস স্পেকট্রোমেট্রি (GC-MS): তেলভিত্তিক দূষক বা অবৈধ অ্যাডিটিভ/রাসায়নিক উপাদান শনাক্ত করতে।
4) মাইক্রোস্কোপিক ওফিজিক্যাল অ্যানালাইসিস: বালি/সিলিকা/চকৃণ কণার উপস্থিতি নির্ণয় করে।
(এই পদ্ধতিগুলো ল্যাব রিপোর্টে স্পষ্ট প্রমাণ দেয় এবং আদালত সমর্থিত প্রমাণ হিসেবে গ্রহণযোগ্য হতে পারে)।

ঘ উত্তর:
প্রলয়নাম (৫০–৭০ শব্দ):
"আপনি যদি সন্দেহ করেন যে আপনার মশলায় ফিলার বা অননুমোদিত উপাদান আছে, তাহলে অনুশীলনগতভাবে তা ব্যবহারে বিরত থাকুন এবং প্যাকেটের লেবেল ও ক্রয়ের রসিদ সংরক্ষণ করুন। স্থানীয় ভোক্তা অধিকার সংস্থা বা স্বাস্থ্য দফতরে অভিযোগ করুন এবং কর্তৃপক্ষকে নমুনা পরীক্ষার জন্য জানান। গণমাধ্যমে বা সামাজিক মাধ্যমে বিভ্রান্তিমূলক তথ্য ছড়িয়ে দেবেন না—প্রমাণভিত্তিকভাবে পদক্ষেপ নিন।"

Explanation:
এই সল্যুশনে নৈতিক ও আইনগত দিকগুলো থেকে স্পষ্টতই ভোক্তা সুরক্ষা, মান নিয়ন্ত্রণ ও কোম্পানির দায়বোধের দিক তুলে দেয়া হয়েছে। ঘরোয়া পরীক্ষাগুলো নিরাপদ, সহজ ও ঝুঁকিমুক্ত রাখা হয়েছে যাতে সাধারণ মানুষ বাড়িতে কোনো বিপজ্জনক রাসায়নিক পরীক্ষা না করেন—এগুলো কেবল প্রাথমিক সন্দেহ নিশ্চিত করতে সহায়তা করবে। ল্যাবভিত্তিক পদ্ধতিগুলো প্রযুক্তিগতভাবে নির্ভুল ও বিজ্ঞতাসম্বলিত; HPLC, GC‑MS, AAS/ICP-MS ইত্যাদি নির্দিষ্ট দূষক ও ভারী ধাতু শনাক্তে ব্যবহৃত হয় এবং এগুলো আদালত-সঙ্গত প্রমাণ দেয়। প্রলয়নাম অংশে ঝুঁকিমুক্ত, কার্যকর ও প্রমাণভিত্তিক আচরণের ওপর জোর দেওয়া হয়েছে—যা ভোক্তা অধিকার সুরক্ষায় জরুরি।

Question:
You have been asked to draft a short expository paragraph on 'Digital Education and E‑Learning' for a school magazine. Use the prompts below to organize your ideas before you write the paragraph.

Options:
ক. ডিজিটাল শিক্ষা বলতে আপনি কী বোঝেন? (সংজ্ঞা)
খ. এটি কোন কোন জায়গায় এবং কীভাবে প্রয়োগ করা হচ্ছে?
গ. ডিজিটাল শিক্ষার ছাত্র-শিক্ষক ও শিক্ষার গুণগত মানে কি প্রভাব পড়ে?
ঘ. সমাজের দুর্বল ও গ্রামীণ শ্রেণিকে শিক্ষার সমান সুযোগ দিতে ডিজিটাল শিক্ষা কীভাবে ব্যবহৃত হতে পারে?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক ডিজিটাল শিক্ষা হল শিক্ষার সেই প্রক্রিয়া যেখানে তথ্য ও পাঠদান ডিজিটাল ডিভাইস, অনলাইন প্ল্যাটফর্ম, মাল্টিমিডিয়া কনটেন্ট এবং ইন্টারনেট-ভিত্তিক সরঞ্জাম ব্যবহার করে সংগঠিত করা হয়। এতে ক্লাসরুম-ভিত্তিক পাঠদানের পাশাপাশি ভিডিও লেকচার, ই-লরনিং কোর্স, ভার্চুয়াল ল্যাব, ইন্টারঅ্যাকটিভ অ্যাপ ও লার্নিং ম্যানেজমেন্ট সিস্টেম অন্তর্ভুক্ত।

খ ডিজিটাল শিক্ষা স্কুল ও বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়, প্রফেশনাল ট্রেনিং সেন্টার, অনলাইন কোর্স প্ল্যাটফর্ম (MOOCs), কর্পোরেট প্রশিক্ষণ, টিউশান সেন্টার এবং রিমোট বা হাইব্রিড ক্লাসে ব্যবহৃত হচ্ছে। ব্যবহারকারীরা স্মার্টফোন, ট্যাবলেট, ল্যাপটপ ও স্মার্টবোর্ড থেকে লাইভ ক্লাস দেখে, রেকর্ডেড লেকচার অনুশীলন করে এবং অনলাইন কোয়িজ ও প্রকল্প জমা দিয়ে শেখে।

গ ডিজিটাল শিক্ষা শেখার গতি ও ব্যাক্তিগতকরণ বাড়ায়; অডিও-ভিজ্যুয়াল কনটেন্ট জটিল ধারণা সহজভাবে বোঝায়, এবং পুনরাবৃত্তি ও স্ব-গভীর অনুশীলনের সুযোগ দেয়। শিক্ষকরা দ্রুত মূল্যায়ন, ফিডব্যাক ও শেখার অগ্রগতি ট্র্যাক করতে পারেন। তবে অনলাইন পরিবেশে মনোযোগ হারানো, প্রযুক্তিগত বানচালতা ও প্রতিকারহীন টেকনিক্যাল ত্রুটি শিক্ষাগত গুণে প্রভাব ফেলতে পারে। শিক্ষক-শিক্ষার্থীর সরাসরি সম্পর্ক কিছু ক্ষেত্রে দুর্বল হতে পারে।

ঘ দুর্বল ও গ্রামীণ শ্রেণিকে সমান সুযোগ দিতে ডিজিটাল শিক্ষা করতে হবে কেবল প্রযুক্তি সরবরাহ নয়, বরং কনটেন্টের স্থানীয়করণ, অফলাইন কনটেন্ট কিউরেশন, শেয়ারড কমিউনিটি টিচিং সেন্টার ও সাশ্রয়ী ইন্টারনেট প্যাকেজের মাধ্যমে। সরকার ও এনজিওদের অনুদান, স্কুল-ভিত্তিক কম্পিউটার ক্লাব, রেডিও/টিভি-ভিত্তিক শিক্ষামালাও কার্যকর। শিক্ষকদের ডিজিটাল ট্রেনিং ও মেটিরিয়াল উপলব্ধ করা হলে সমতা উন্নয়ন সম্ভব।

সংক্ষিপ্ত অনুচ্ছেদ (৩–৪ সারি সারসংক্ষেপ): ডিজিটাল শিক্ষা হলো ইন্টারনেট ও ডিজিটাল সরঞ্জাম ব্যবহার করে শেখার একটি আধুনিক পদ্ধতি যা স্কুল, বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় ও প্রশিক্ষণ সংস্থায় দ্রুত জনপ্রিয় হচ্ছে। এটি পাঠগুণ উন্নত করে, শেখাকে ব্যক্তিগতকৃত ও উপভোক্তা-বান্ধব করে তুলতে পারে, তবে প্রযুক্তিগত অসাম্য ও মনোযোগজনিত চ্যালেঞ্জ রয়েছে। গ্রামীণ ও দুর্বল জনগোষ্ঠীকে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করতে সাশ্রয়ী প্রযুক্তি, অফলাইন কনটেন্ট ও স্থানীয় সহায়তা দরকার, ফলে ডিজিটাল শিক্ষা সকলের জন্য সমান সুযোগ নিশ্চিত করতে পারে।

Explanation:
উত্তরগুলি ডিজিটাল শিক্ষার মূল ধারণা, প্রয়োগ ক্ষেত্র, ইতিবাচক ও নেতিবাচক প্রভাব এবং সমাজের দুর্বল শ্রেণিকে কিভাবে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করা যায়—এই ধারাবাহিকতা অনুসারে সাজানো হয়েছে। প্রথম অংশে সংজ্ঞা দিয়ে মূল বৈশিষ্ট্য বোঝানো হয়েছে। প্রয়োগ অংশে বাস্তব জীবনের উদাহরণ দেওয়া হয়েছে যাতে পাঠক বুঝতে পারে কোথায় কীভাবে ব্যবহার হয়। প্রভাব অংশে শিক্ষার গুণগত উন্নতি ও সম্ভাব্য ঝুঁকি উভয় দিক বিবেচনা করা হয়েছে। অন্তিম অংশে প্রযুক্তিগত অসমতা ও স্থানীয়করণের প্রয়োজনীয় সমাধানগুলো তুলে ধরা হয়েছে, যাতে বাস্তবপক্ষে কার্যকর নীতি-নির্দেশ প্রস্তুত করা যায়।

Question:
Imagine you must prepare a balanced paragraph titled 'Social Media and Community Life' for a civic-awareness brochure. Use the guiding prompts below to develop your paragraph.

Options:
ক. সোশ্যাল মিডিয়া বলতে কী বোঝানো হয়?
খ. এটি কীভাবে জনগণকে সক্রিয় ও সংযুক্ত করে?
গ. কোন ধরনের নেতিবাচক প্রভাব দেখা দেয় এবং কেন?
ঘ. সোশ্যাল মিডিয়াকে নিরাপদ ও উৎপাদনশীলভাবে ব্যবহারের জন্য কী ব্যবস্থা নেওয়া যেতে পারে?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক সোশ্যাল মিডিয়া হলো অনলাইন প্ল্যাটফর্ম ও অ্যাপ্লিকেশন যেখানে ব্যবহারকারীরা তথ্য, ছবি, ভিডিও ও মতামত শেয়ার করে এবং একে-অপরের সঙ্গে যোগাযোগ করে। উদাহরণ: ফেসবুক, টুইটার, ইনস্টাগ্রাম, ইউটিউব ও চ্যাট অ্যাপসমূহ।

খ সোশ্যাল মিডিয়া জনগণকে খবর আদানপ্রদান, গণমাধ্যম-প্রতিবাদের দ্রুততা, সামাজিক আন্দোলন সংগঠিত করা, কমিউনিটি গ্রুপ তৈরি করে স্থানীয় সমস্যাগুলো उजागर ও সমাধান খুঁজতে সাহায্য করে। এতে স্বেচ্ছাসেবী প্রচার, অনলাইন_petitions_, ফান্ডরেইজিং ও জরুরি সতর্কতা দ্রুত ছড়িয়ে পড়ে।

ঘ. দারিদ্র্য ও পরিবেশ সংরক্ষণের জন্য নবায়নযোগ্য শক্তি কীভাবে কার্যকর হতে পারে?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক নবায়নযোগ্য শক্তি প্রযুক্তি হলো এমন উৎস ও যন্ত্রপাতি যা পুনর্ব্যবহৃত বা অবিরতভাবে প্রাকৃতিকভাবে পূরণযোগ্য উৎস থেকে শক্তি তৈরি করে—যেমন সৌর (সোলার প্যানেল, سولার ওয়াটার হিটিং), বায়ু টারবাইন, হাইড্রোপাওয়ার, বায়োমাস ও জিওথার্মাল। এগুলো পরম্পরাগত জীবাশ্ম জ্বালানির চেয়ে কম কার্বন নির্গমন করে।

খ গৃহস্থালিতে সৌর প্যানেল ছাদে লাগিয়ে বিদ্যুৎ উৎপাদন, সৌর গরম পানি, ছোট ব্যাটারি-ভিত্তিক স্টোরেজ সিস্টেম ও অফ-গ্রিড লাইটিং ব্যবহার করা হচ্ছে। শিল্পে বড় সৌর-ওয়াইন্ড পার্ক, বায়োমাস প্ল্যান্ট ও হাইব্রিড গ্রিড ইন্টিগ্রেশন করে উৎপাদন স্থিতিশীল করা হচ্ছে। কৃষিতে সোলার পাম্পিং ও সোলার-ড্রাইং ব্যবহৃত হচ্ছে।

গ প্রধান সুবিধা: পরিবেশবান্ধব (কম কার্বন), জ্বালানি নিরাপত্তা ও দীর্ঘমেয়াদে কম অপারেটিং খরচ। সীমাবদ্ধতা: সূর্য/বাতাসের অনিয়ম (ইন্টারমিটেন্সি), প্রাথমিক বিনিয়োগ ব্যয়, গ্রিড-ইন্টিগ্রেশন চ্যালেঞ্জ ও ব্যাটারি স্টোরেজের সীমা। স্থানীয় প্রযুক্তি ও ইনফ্রাসট্রাকচারের উন্নতিতে এসব সীমা কমে আসছে।

ঘ দারিদ্র্য ও পরিবেশ সংরক্ষণে নবায়নযোগ্য শক্তি কার্যকর কারণ গ্রামীণ এলাকায় সস্তা ও স্থিতিশীল শক্তি প্রদান করে, কৃষি উৎপাদন বাড়াতে সাহায্য করে (পাম্পিং, ক'ল্ড স্টোরেজ) এবং বনভূমি-নাশ কমায় যদি জীবাশ্ম জ্বালানির উপর নির্ভরতা কমে। ছোট-স্কেল কমিউনিটি-ভিত্তিক সিস্টেম ও মাইক্রো-ফাইন্যান্স প্রকল্প দারিদ্র্য বিমোচনে সহায়ক।

সংক্ষিপ্ত অনুচ্ছেদ (সংকলিত): নবায়নযোগ্য শক্তি প্রযুক্তি—সৌর, বায়ু, হাইড্রো ও বায়োমাস—ব্যবহার করে আমরা পরিবেশ-দক্ষ ও নির্ভরশীলতা কমানো শক্তিতে রূপান্তর করতে পারি। গৃহস্থালী ও শিল্পে ইতিমধ্যেই ব্যবহৃত এই প্রযুক্তিগুলি স্থায়ী ব্যয়-সাশ্রয় ও গ্রামীণ উন্নয়নে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ভূমিকা রাখে; ইনভেস্টমেন্ট, স্টোরেজ ও নীতিগত সহায়তা বাড়ালে তাদের সীমাবদ্ধতাগুলো অতিক্রম করে বৃহত্তর সামাজিক কল্যাণ অর্জন সম্ভব।

Explanation:
উত্তরগুলো নবায়নযোগ্য শক্তির সুস্পষ্ট সংজ্ঞা দিয়ে শুরু করে ব্যবহারিক প্রয়োগ, সুবিধা ও সীমাবদ্ধতা বিশ্লেষণ করেছে। শেষ অংশে সামাজিক-অর্থনৈতিক গুরুত্ব তুলে ধরা হয়েছে—কীভাবে স্থানীয় ও দরিদ্র জনপদে এসব প্রযুক্তি জীবনমান উন্নত করবে। এই কাঠামোটি পাঠককে একটি সামগ্রিক, বাস্তবভিত্তিক ধারণা দেয় যাতে নীতি-প্রনয়ন ও স্থানীয় উদ্যোগে সহায়ক প্রচেষ্টা পরিকল্পিত হতে পারে।

Question:
The line chart illustrates the percentage of households with access to safely managed drinking water in Country X for selected years between 2000 and 2018. The recorded values are: 2000 — 62%, 2004 — 69%, 2008 — 77%, 2012 — 84%, 2015 — 88%, 2018 — 91%. Use this information to answer the sub-questions below.

গ. 2000 থেকে 2018 পর্যন্ত মোট কত শতাংশ পয়েন্ট বৃদ্ধি হয়েছে? (অঙ্কসহ দেখান)
ঘ. এই উন্নয়নে সাহায্যকারী দুটি বাস্তবসম্মত জননীতি বা প্রকল্প কি হতে পারে? প্রতিটির জন্য সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা দিন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The chart shows a clear and sustained improvement in household access to safely managed drinking water in Country X from 2000 to 2018. Beginning at 62% in 2000, access rose steadily through the early and mid-2000s, reaching 69% in 2004 and 77% in 2008. The upward trend continued into the 2010s with marked gains (84% in 2012, 88% in 2015) and culminated at 91% in 2018. Overall the pattern is one of consistent year-on-year improvement with larger gains during 2004–2008 and steady, smaller gains after 2012, indicating successful long-term investment in water infrastructure and service delivery.

খ The greatest single increase compared to the previous recorded year occurred between 2004 and 2008: the value rose from 69% to 77%, an increase of 8 percentage points.

গ Overall percentage-point increase from 2000 to 2018 = 91% − 62% = [math]29[/math] percentage points.

ঘ Two realistic policies that could have contributed:
1) National water infrastructure programme: Large-scale investment in piped networks, drilling protected wells, and treatment facilities — these increase coverage and reliability, explaining the steady rise. 
2) Targeted rural sanitation and community-management schemes: Training local water committees, subsidising household connections for low-income families, and regular maintenance funding — these increase sustainability and equitable access, helping the later-stage gains (post-2012).

Explanation:
For (ক) the answer synthesizes the year-by-year percentages into an overall narrative: steady improvement with larger early gains and smaller later gains. For (খ) we compared consecutive recorded values to find the maximum increase (69%→77% = 8 points). For (গ) we computed a straightforward subtraction to get a 29 percentage-point rise. For (ঘ) the suggested policies reflect typical, evidence-based interventions that directly increase coverage (infrastructure investment) and maintain equitable service (community management and subsidies).

Question:
The bar chart presents the youth unemployment rate (ages 15–24) in Country Z at six benchmark years: 1990 — 18%, 1995 — 22%, 2000 — 16%, 2005 — 12%, 2010 — 20%, 2015 — 14%. Use these values to respond to the questions below.

Options:
ক. উপর্যুক্ত মানগুলোকে বিবেচনায় প্রবণতা বিশ্লেষণ করুন (কমপক্ষে 80 শব্দে)।
খ. কোন সময়কালগুলোতে বর্ধন ঘটেছে এবং কোন সময়কালগুলোতে হ্রাস ঘটেছে? দুটো ক্রমানুসারে উদাহরণ দিন।
গ. উল্লেখিত ছয়টি বছরের গড় যুব বেকারত্ব হার কত? (পদক্ষেপসহ দেখান)
ঘ. যুব বেকারত্ব হ্রাস করতে দুইটি লক্ষ্যভিত্তিক নীতিমালা প্রস্তাব করুন এবং সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা দিন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The youth unemployment rate in Country Z fluctuated over the 25-year span rather than following a simple linear trend. It rose from 18% in 1990 to a peak of 22% in 1995, then improved markedly to 16% by 2000 and continued to fall to its low of 12% in 2005. However, the rate worsened again by 2010, jumping to 20%, before improving to 14% in 2015. This pattern suggests cyclical influences—periods of economic slowdown raising youth unemployment, followed by recovery phases and possibly the effect of active labour-market measures in some intervals.

খ Examples:
- Rise: 1990 → 1995 (18% to 22%) — increase. Also 2005 → 2010 (12% to 20%) — increase.
- Fall: 1995 → 2000 (22% to 16%) — decrease. Also 2000 → 2005 (16% to 12%) — decrease.

গ Compute the mean of the six values: sum = 18 + 22 + 16 + 12 + 20 + 14 = 102. Average = [math]102 \div 6 = 17[/math]%. So the average youth unemployment rate across the recorded years is 17%.

ঘ Two targeted policies:
1) Apprenticeship and vocational training subsidies: Subsidise employer-provided apprenticeships and expand vocational programs aligned with market needs — this improves youth employability and bridges the school-to-work transition. 
2) Youth wage incentives and start-up support: Time-limited payroll subsidies for hiring young workers and micro-grants/mentoring for youth entrepreneurship — these stimulate demand for youth labour and create pathways into self-employment.

Explanation:
For (ক) the analysis narrates the rises and falls and links them to plausible economic cycles and policy effects. For (খ) consecutive year-to-year comparisons identify intervals of increase and decrease. For (গ) the arithmetic mean was computed by summing the percentages and dividing by the count of observations: average = 102/6 = 17%. For (ঘ) the recommended policies target both supply-side (skills) and demand-side (employer incentives) constraints that typically drive youth unemployment.

Question:
The area chart depicts the percentage of the population in Region Y consuming less than the recommended daily calorie intake at selected years: 1998 — 34%, 2002 — 28%, 2006 — 25%, 2010 — 30%, 2014 — 22%. Based on this data, respond to the prompts below.

খ. কোন দুটি পর্যায়/ধাপে সর্বাধিক উন্নতি (সবচেয়ে বড় হ্রাস) ঘটেছে এবং কত শতাংশ পয়েন্ট ছিল?
গ. 1998 থেকে 2014 পর্যন্ত শতকরা পয়েন্ট হিসেবে এবং আপেক্ষিকভাবে কতটা পরিবর্তন হয়েছে? (গণনা দেখান)
ঘ. এই খাদ্যাভাস প্রবণতার জনস্বাস্থ্যগত সম্ভাব্য ফলাফল দুইটি এবং মোকাবেলায় দুইটি নীতি পরামর্শ দিন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক The series shows an overall improvement in caloric sufficiency between 1998 and 2014, although there is a mid-period setback. Initially the share of the population below recommended calories fell from 34% in 1998 to 28% in 2002 and then to 25% in 2006, indicating progress. However, this trend reversed in 2010 when the prevalence rose to 30%, suggesting a temporary deterioration (perhaps due to shocks). By 2014 strong improvement resumed, reaching 22%, the lowest recorded value. The pattern implies overall progress but vulnerability to intermittent factors.

খ The largest single improvement (largest decrease compared with the previous recorded year) occurred between 2010 and 2014: from 30% down to 22% = 8 percentage points. (Other decreases: 1998→2002 = 6 points; 2002→2006 = 3 points.)

গ Absolute (percentage-point) change: 1998 → 2014 = 34% − 22% = [math]12[/math] percentage points. Relative change (percent decline relative to 1998): [math](12 \div 34) \times 100 \approx 35.29\%[/math]. So a 12 percentage-point improvement, equivalent to about a 35.3% relative reduction in the population under the calorie threshold.

ঘ Public-health consequences and policy responses:
- Consequence 1: Reduced prevalence of undernutrition lowers child stunting and improves cognitive development and productivity. Policy: Strengthen maternal and child nutrition programs (supplementary feeding, micronutrient fortification) to consolidate gains.
- Consequence 2: Vulnerability to shocks (the 2010 rebound) indicates food-security risk; intermittent food insecurity can increase morbidity. Policy: Build resilience via social safety nets (targeted cash transfers, food reserves) and support smallholder productivity (improved seeds, irrigation) to stabilize food availability.

Explanation:
For (ক) the narrative synthesises the year-by-year values into a coherent story: overall decline with a mid-period reversal. For (খ) successive differences identify the largest reduction (30%→22% = 8 points). For (গ) both absolute and relative changes were computed: absolute = 12 percentage points; relative = (12/34)*100 ≈ 35.29%. For (ঘ) suggested policies address both direct nutrition interventions and broader food security/resilience measures to prevent future rebounds.

খ উত্তর: গ্রিন বেল্ট মুভমেন্টের দুটি মূল লক্ষ্য: (1) বৃক্ষরোপণ ও পরিবেশরক্ষা — উদাহরণ: ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত বনাঞ্চলে পুনরায় গাছ লাগানো যাতে মাটি ক্ষয়ের সমস্যা কমে; (2) নারী ও সম্প্রদায়ের ক্ষমতায়ন — উদাহরণ: মহিলাদের সংগঠিত করে স্বনির্ভরতার জন্য গাছ লাগানো ও বনসম্পদ ব্যবস্থাপনায় তাদের অংশগ্রহণ নিশ্চিত করা।

গ উত্তর: পরিবেশগত রক্ষণাবেক্ষণ ও নাগরিক অংশগ্রহণ পরস্পরকে শক্তিশালী করে কারণ স্থানীয় মানুষদের প্রকৃত সম্পদ (বন, জল, মাটি) রক্ষা করতে সক্রিয় করা হলে তারা পরিবেশের অবনতি মোকাবিলায় নীতিগত দাবি তুলতে সমর্থ হয়; একই সঙ্গে পরিবেশের উন্নতি তাদের জীবিকা বাড়ায়, ফলে নাগরিক অংশগ্রহণ বাড়ে এবং স্থানীয় গণতন্ত্র প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয়।

ঘ উত্তর: তিনটি কর্মপরিকল্পনা: (1) কমিউনিটি বৃক্ষরোপণ কর্মসূচি — স্কুল ও মহিলাদের গ্রুপ নিয়ে সক্রিয় রোপণ অভিযান ও পরিচর্যা পরিকল্পনা; (2) নারীদের দক্ষতা উন্নয়ন কর্মশালা — গাছচাষ ও ক্ষুদ্রউদ্যোগ চালানোর প্রশিক্ষণ দেয়া যাতে তারা বনসম্পদ থেকে টেকসই উপায়ে উপকৃত হয়; (3) স্থানীয় পরিবেশ নীতি সচেতনতামূলক সভা — জনগণকে পরিবেশগত অধিকার ও স্থানীয় প্রশাসনের কাছে দাবি তোলার কৌশল শিখিয়ে অংশগ্রহণমূলক নীতিগত পরিবর্তন অনুরোধ করা।

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা: ক-তে মূল ঘটনাক্রম ও ফলাফলকে সংক্ষেপে পুনরায় লেখা হয়েছে। খ-তে অনুচ্ছেদের প্রতিটি উল্লেখ্য লক্ষ্য আলাদা করে নেয়া হয়েছে এবং বাস্তব উদাহরণ দেওয়া হয়েছে যাতে পাঠক লক্ষ্যগুলো সহজে বুঝতে পারে। গ-তে একটি বস্তুনিষ্ঠ কারণ-ফল শব্দচয়ন ব্যবহার করে বোঝানো হয়েছে কেন পরিবেশ ও নাগরিক অংশগ্রহণ পরস্পর সহায়ক। ঘ-তে অনুচ্ছেদের নীতির সঙ্গে খাপ খাওয়ানো বাস্তবিক এবং বাস্তবসম্মত কর্মপরিকল্পনা প্রস্তাব করা হয়েছে, যা স্থানীয় পর্যায়ে বাস্তবে করা যেতে পারে।

Question:
I am Sofia. I am 15 and I fled my hometown with my younger brother after our house was burned during a clash. We now live in a crowded refugee camp. My brother has trouble sleeping and cries often. Food is scarce, the water is unreliable and the clinic only opens twice a week. I attend a makeshift school for a few hours but sometimes skip because we need to queue for food or fetch water. I worry about my brother getting sick, and I miss our old home. Some aid workers visit and promise help but it rarely reaches our tent. We try to keep hope, but some nights it feels impossible.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক সংক্ষিপ্ত সারসংক্ষেপ: Софিয়া, ১৫, এবং তাঁর ছোট ভাই একটি দাঙ্গায় ঘর পোড়ার পরে শরণার্থী ছিলে; তারা এক ভিড়ভাড় ক্যাম্পে থাকে যেখানে খাবার, পানি ও চিকিৎসা অসংকুল। Софিয়া মাঝে মাঝে অস্থায়ী স্কুলে যায়, কিন্তু খাদ্য ও পানি সংগ্রহের কাজ তাদের পড়াশোনা ব্যাহত করে। ত্রাণ কামরা আসে বলে আশ্বাস দেওয়া হয়, কিন্তু সহায়তা ঠিকমত পৌঁছায় না।খ মূল ধারণা: জন্মগত বিপর্যয় ও অসম্পূর্ণ সহায়তার ফলে একজন কিশোরী ও তাঁর ভাই মানবিক চাহিদা ও নিরাপত্তাহীনতার সঙ্গে সংগ্রাম করছে।গ দুইটি প্রধান মানবিক সমস্যা: ১) মৌলিক চাহিদার অভাব — পর্যাপ্ত খাবার ও নিরাপদ পানি নেই; ২) স্বাস্থ্য ও সুরক্ষা ঝুঁকি — সীমিত চিকিৎসা সেবা এবং মানসিক আক্রান্ততা (ছোট ভাইয়ের ঘুমের সমস্যা ও কান্না)।ঘ তিনটি বাস্তবসম্মত পরামর্শ: ১) নিকটস্থ এনজিও/ক্যাম্প ম্যানেজমেন্টকে খাদ্য ও পানি বিতরণের স্থিতিশীল পরিকল্পনা এবং শিশু-নিরাপত্তা নিশ্চিত করার জন্য অনুরোধ করা; ২) দ্রুত-প্রতিদান মেডিকাল ভ্যান/চিকিৎসা ক্যাম্পের আয়োজন যাতে ভাইয়ের ঘুম-মানসিক সমস্যা এবং সাধারণ চিকিৎসা দ্রুত মিটে; ৩) শিক্ষার জন্য সংক্ষিপ্ত সময়ের ফ্লেক্সিবল ব্যবস্থা (যেমন খাদ্য সার্ভিসের সময়ে সন্তানদের জন্য অনুপস্থিতি মঞ্জুর ও বিকল্প শ্রেণি) যাতে Софিয়া পড়াশোনায় ফিরতে পারে।

Explanation:
উপস্থাপিত লেখাটি থেকে সরাসরি সেই তথ্যগুলো সংগ্রহ করা হয়েছে: আগুনে ভাঙচুরের ফলে বাস্তববাস হারানো, ক্যাম্পে খাওয়া-জল ও চিকিৎসার ঘাটতি, শিশুর মানসিক অস্থিরতা এবং অসম্পূর্ণ ত্রাণবিতরণ। সারসংক্ষেপে কেবল মূল তথ্যগুলো সংক্ষেপ করা হয়েছে। মূল ধারণা এক লাইনে তুলে ধরা হয়েছে যাতে পাঠকের দৃষ্টি লেখার কেন্দ্রীয় বিষয় — ঝুঁকিপূর্ণ মানবিক অবস্থার ওপর থাকে। সমস্যাগুলো বাস্তবিকভাবে নির্বাচিত হয়েছে: মৌলিক চাহিদার ঘাটতি এবং স্বাস্থ্য/মনস্তাত্ত্বিক ঝুঁকি। প্রস্তাবিত সমাধানগুলো বাস্তবসম্মত ও সরাসরি—স্থানীয় সংস্থার সাথে সমন্বয়, দ্রুত চিকিৎসা সেবা, ও শিক্ষা-ফ্লেক্সিবিলিটি—যা তত্ক্ষণিক উন্নতি আনতে পারে।

Question:
My name is Javier. I am 17 and I work on construction sites. I left school two years ago to help my family pay the rent. I wake up before sunrise, carry heavy loads, mix cement, and sometimes climb scaffolding without safety gear. My supervisor yells and sometimes withholds pay if we complain. In rainy season the work becomes dangerous and I have already had two injuries. I dream of finishing school, but I feel trapped because my family depends on my wages.

Options:
ক. লঘুকথন (concise summary) লেখো।
খ. লেখাটির আবহ কীভাবে বর্ণনা করা যায় (উদাহরণ: হতাশ, চাপযুক্ত, ইত্যাদি)? একটা শব্দে বলো ও সংক্ষিপ্ত কারণও লেখো।
গ. এই শিশুশ্রমিক অবস্থার কমপক্ষে তিনটি নেতিবাচক পরিণতি কী হতে পারে লেখো।
ঘ. একটি নীতি-স্তরের এবং একটি কমিউনিটি-স্তরের পদক্ষেপ প্রস্তাব করো, মোট দুইটি পরামর্শ।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক লঘুকথন: Javier, ১৭, স্কুল ছেড়ে পরিবারের সহায়তার জন্য নির্মাণ শ্রমী হিসেবে কাজ করে; তিনি ঝুঁকি পূর্ণ কাজ করেন—ওজনভর্তি বহন, সুরক্ষা ছাড়া উঁচু জায়গায় উঠা—এবং নিয়মিত আঘাত পান; তিনি আবারও পড়াশোনা করতে চায় কিন্তু আর্থিক বাধ্যবাধকতা তাকে আটকে রেখেছে।খ আবহ: চাপযুক্ত (strained). কারণ: দৈনিক কষ্টকর শারীরিক শ্রম, নিরাপত্তার অভাব, সুপারভাইজারের দমনাত্মক আচরণ এবং পরিবারের ওপর আর্থিক নির্ভরতা সব মিলিয়ে তীব্র মানসিক ও শারীরিক চাপ সৃষ্টি করে।গ তিনটি নেতিবাচক পরিণতি: ১) দীর্ঘমেয়াদী শারীরিক ক্ষতি—মেরুদণ্ড বা পেশীতে দমোন; ২) শিক্ষাগত ব্যর্থতা ও ভবিষ্যৎ আয়ের সীমাবদ্ধতা—শিক্ষা ছাড়ার ফলে পেশাগত বিকল্প কমে যায়; ৩) শ্রম শোষণ ও মানসিক সমস্যা—অবৈধ বেতন-নিরোধ, শ্রমিক নির্যাতন ও উদ্বেগ/বিষন্নতা।ঘ দুটি পদক্ষেপ: (নীতি-স্তর) স্থানীয় শ্রম আইনের কার্যকর কার্যক্রম ও শিশু শ্রম নিরোধের স্পষ্ট পর্যবেক্ষণ বৃদ্ধি—উদাহরণ: নির্মাণ কাজে বয়স যাচাই, জরিমানা ও সাবলম্বী বিকল্প পুনর্বাসন প্রোগ্রাম; (কমিউনিটি-স্তর) বিকল্প আয়ের ও শিক্ষার সমন্বিত প্রোগ্রাম—যেমন অংশকালীন শিক্ষা + দক্ষতা প্রশিক্ষণ এবং পরিবার-সমর্থন ভর্তুকি যাতে Javier পড়া চালিয়ে যেতে পারে এবং পরিবারের আয় ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত না হয়।

Explanation:
সারাংশ লেখায় Javier-এর বর্তমান কাজ, ঝুঁকি, আর্থিক প্ররোচনা ও পড়াশোনার আকাঙ্ক্ষা তুলে ধরা হয়েছে। আবহ হিসেবে 'চাপযুক্ত' শব্দটি নির্বাচিত কারণ গল্পে বারবার কাজের কষ্ট, নিরাপত্তাহীনতা ও দমনাত্মক সুপারভাইজারের উল্লেখ আছে। নেতিবাচক পরিণতিগুলো সাধারণত শিশু শ্রম থেকে উদ্ভূত ও সুস্পষ্ট (শরীরিক ক্ষতি, শিক্ষাগত ক্ষতি, মানসিক/শোষণমূলক সমস্যা)। নীতি-স্তরের পদক্ষেপ আইন-প্রয়োগ ও মনিটরিং জোরদার করে দীর্ঘমেয়াদে পরিবর্তন আনবে; কমিউনিটি-স্তরের পদক্ষেপ সঙ্গে আঞ্চলিক বাস্তবতার সঙ্গে মানানসই এবং তাত্ক্ষণিক প্রভাব ফেলতে পারে—পরিবারকে বিকল্প সহায়তা দিলে Javier পড়াশোনায় ফিরতে পারবে।

ঘ. রজুর অবস্থা নিরাপদ করার জন্য তিনটি অতি জরুরি পদক্ষেপ সরবরাহ করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক সংক্ষিপ্ত সারসংক্ষেপ: Raju, ১৪, স্লাম এলাকার একটি ই-ওয়েস্ট রিসাইক্লিং কর্মশালায় পুরনো ইলেকট্রনিক ভাঙেন; তাঁরা তামা বার করতে তারকাগুলো জ্বালায়, ফলে ধোঁয়া ও রাসায়নিক ছড়ায়; তিনি কাশি, হাতে ঘা এবং মাথা ঘোরা ভোগ করেন, তবু পরিবার সাহায্যের কারণে কাজ চালিয়ে যান এবং মাঝে মাঝে স্কুল যেতে পারেন।খ তিনটি স্বাস্থ্যগত ঝুঁকি: ১) শ্বাসনালীজনিত সমস্যা—ধোঁয়া ও বিষাক্ত গ্যাস শ্বাসে কাশি, শ্বাসকষ্ট; ২) ত্বক ও সংক্রমণ—খোলা চর্মঘা ও রাসায়নিক স্পর্শে ঘা ও সংক্রমণের ঝুঁকি; ৩) সিস্টেমিক বিষক্রিয়া—ভারী ধাতু (যেমন পারদ, সীসা) এবং বিষাক্ত কণা শোষিত হলে মাথা ঝিমঝিম, স্নায়ুবিক ক্ষতি বা দীর্ঘমেয়াদী রোগ হতে পারে।গ পুনর্লিখন (paraphrase): "We burn the wires to extract the metal, and the fumes from that make me start coughing."ঘ তিনটি জরুরি পদক্ষেপ: ১) অবিলম্বে ব্যক্তিগত সুরক্ষা সরঞ্জাম প্রদান — মাস্ক, রাবার গ্লাভস, এবং চোখের চশমা; ২) খোলা জায়গায় বা ভেন্টিলেশনের ব্যবস্থা সহ নিরাপদ প্রক্রিয়া প্রয়োগ এবং বিকল্প বেচার পদ্ধতি (যেমন তাপবিহীন মেকানিক্যাল বিচ্ছেদ) খোঁজা; ৩) স্বাস্থ্য পরীক্ষা ও চিকিৎসা সুবিধা নিশ্চিত করা — তাত্ক্ষণিক মেডিক্যাল চেকআপ, টিটানাস/প্রয়োজনীয় ভ্যাকসিন এবং বিষকলার জন্য নিরীক্ষণ।

Explanation:
সারাংশে রজুর কাজের প্রকৃতি, ঝুঁকি ও স্বাস্থ্য লক্ষণ সংক্ষেপ করা হয়েছে। স্বাস্থ্যগত ঝুঁকিগুলো লেখায় প্রদত্ত লক্ষণ (কাশি, ঘা, মাথা ঘোরা) এবং ই-ওয়েস্ট রিসাইক্লিং-এর সাধারণ জ্ঞান থেকে নিরূপিত। পুনর্লিখনটি মূল বাক্যের অর্থ অক্ষুণ্ণ রেখে আলাদা শব্দভাণ্ডার ব্যবহার করে করা হয়েছে। তাত্ক্ষণিক পদক্ষেপগুলো বাস্তবসম্মত ও ঝুঁকি হ্রাসকেন্দ্রিক: ব্যক্তিগত সুরক্ষা সরঞ্জাম দ্রুততম প্রয়োজনে ঘাটতি পূরণ করে; ভেন্টিলেশন ও প্রক্রিয়ার পরিবর্তন দূষণ কমাবে; স্বাস্থ্য পরীক্ষার ব্যবস্থা ফলে বিষক্রিয়ার প্রাথমিক সনাক্তকরণ ও চিকিৎসা সম্ভব হবে।

Question:
A short lyric describes an autumn evening: "The leaves clap softly to the ground—no applause for the hands that planted them. The air wears a shawl of memory; lamps wink where promises once lingered. Even the river takes a quieter course, as if ashamed of carrying voices that forgot to call back." Read this passage and respond to the sub-questions.

ঘ. এই অনুচ্ছেদের জন্য একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত শিরোনাম প্রস্তাব করো এবং কেন তা উপযুক্ত—একটু ব্যাখ্যা করো।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক সারাংশ: শীতশেষ বেলায় প্রকৃতির নীরব অবতরণ মানুষের অকৃতজ্ঞতা ও বিস্মরণের থেকে মধুর বা স্পষ্ট অভিনন্দনের আশা পায় না।

খ কেন্দ্রীয় রূপক: "পাতা বাতাসে তালির মতো মাটিতে নামা"—এটি প্রকৃতির কর্মকে মানবিক ক্রিয়ার (অভিনন্দন বা প্রত্যুত্তর) সঙ্গে মিলিয়ে মানুষের অবহেলা ও ভুলে যাওয়া বোঝায়। আরেকটি রূপক হল নদীর নীরব স্রোতকে "শরমা“-স্বরূপ দেখানো, যা মানুষের ভাষ্য-অপস্থিতিকে চিত্রায়িত করে।

গ কাব্যিক উপকরন:
- ব্যক্তিকরণ (Personification): "পাতা ক্ল্যাপ করে", "বাতাস শাল পরেছে", "ল্যাম্প ক্ষণিক চোখ মলায়"—প্রকৃতির বস্তুকে মানুষের বৈশিষ্ট্য দেয়া হয়েছে, যা আবেগ ও বিমর্ষতা জোর দিয়ে তুলে ধরে।
- ধারণাগত সাদৃশ্য/ছবি (Imagery/visual metaphor): "নদী নীরব পথ নেয়, যেন কল করা ভুলে গেছে"—দৃশ্যমান ও শ্রবণীয় উপাদান ব্যবহার করে অনুচ্ছেদটি মর্মস্পর্শী করে তোলে।

ঘ প্রস্তাবিত শিরোনাম: "অভিনন্দনহীন শরৎ"—এটি মূল থিমকে সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে ধরে: শরৎকালীন প্রকৃতি উপস্থিত কিন্তু মানুষের কৃতজ্ঞতা বা প্রতিক্রিয়া অনুপস্থিত।

Explanation:
ক সংক্ষেপে অনুচ্ছেদের মুখ্য অর্থ তুলে ধরে—প্রকৃতি ও মানুষের আচরণের মাধ্যাকর্ষণ-শূন্যতা। খ-তে মূল রূপকগুলো আলাদা করে দেখানো হয়েছে: পাতার ক্রিয়া ও নদীর আচরণকে মানুষের সম্পর্কের অনুপস্থিতির প্রতিচ্ছবি হিসেবে দেখা হয়েছে। গ-তে ব্যক্তিকরণ ও ইমেজারি নির্বাচন করে উদাহরণসহ ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়েছে কারণ এগুলো পাঠকের আবেগকে সক্রিয় করে এবং অনুচ্ছেদের বিষণ্ণ সুর গঠন করে। ঘ-তে সংক্ষিপ্ত, অর্থপূর্ণ শিরোনাম দেয়া হয়েছে যা থিমকে সরাসরি প্রতিফলিত করে এবং পাঠকের মনোযোগ আকর্ষণ করে।

Question:
A reflective stanza paints a thawing morning: "Frost loosens its clasp; street gutters remember the footfalls that passed and then fell silent. Words that once promised bridges now hang like melting icicles—clear but vanishing. The skyline stretches, indifferent, as if learning to live without the echoes of certain voices." Consider this and answer the questions below.

Options:
ক. উক্ত অনুচ্ছেদটির মূল বক্তব্য এক-দুই পংক্তিতে লেখ।
খ. কোন বাক্যটি সবচেয়ে বেশি নীরব-বিমর্ষের (melancholic) টোন প্রদর্শন করে—কারণসহ চিহ্নিত করো।
গ. এখানে কোন ধরনের লোডেড শব্দ (loaded word) বা অর্থভারী শব্দ ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে—কমপক্ষে একটি উদাহরণ এবং তার প্রভাব ব্যাখ্যা করো।
ঘ. এই অনুচ্ছেদের উপর ভিত্তি করে একটি ছোট প্রশ্ন (একটি বাক্যে) তৈরী করো যা পাঠককে চিন্তার জন্য প্ররোচিত করবে।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক মূল বক্তব্য: ওয়াক্তের বদলে যাওয়া—পুরনো প্রতিশ্রুতি এবং কথাবার্তা গলে গিয়ে অদৃশ্য হলেও তার শূণ্যতা ও উত্তরের অনুপস্থিতি মানুষের অভিব্যক্তিকে নীরবে ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত করে।

খ সবচেয়ে নীরব-বিমর্ষ বাক্য: "শহরের খালেরা যে পায়ের ছাপ মনে রেখেছিল, তারপর নীরবে স্তব্ধ হয়ে পড়ল।" কারণ এটি কার্যত উপস্থিত ছিল এমন জীবনীশক্তির নিস্তেজ হওয়া এবং বোধগম্য নীরবতা—অস্তিত্বের অনুপস্থিতি—দেখায়।

গ অর্থভারী শব্দের উদাহরণ: "গলছে রূপরেখা" (melting icicles) বা "শূন্যতা" শব্দগুলো—"গলছে" শব্দটি পরিবর্তন ও নিঃশেষের অনুভূতি জাগায়; "শূন্যতা" শব্দটি আবেগগত ও দার্শনিক বোঝা যোগ করে, পাঠককে তীব্র অভাববোধে নিয়ে যায়।

ঘ চিন্তা-উদ্দীপক প্রশ্ন: "কী ঘটে যখন প্রতিশ্রুতির শব্দগুলো স্বচ্ছ কিন্তু অদৃশ্য হয়ে যায়—তারা কি কখনো বাস্তবিকভাবে জয়ী হয়েছিল?"

Explanation:
ক: সারাংশটি সংক্ষিপ্তভাবে সময়ের পরিবর্তন ও কথার ক্ষয়কে তুলে ধরে। খ: যে বাক্যটি পছন্দ করা হয়েছে তা পরিবেশগত নীরবতা ও মানবিক ক্ষোভ মিলিয়ে দেয়—এটি টোনের মূল উৎস। গ: লোডেড শব্দগুলো—যেমন "গলছে" বা "শূন্যতা"—পাঠকের আবেগ ও কৌতূহল উভয়কেই উদ্দীপ্ত করে; এগুলো কেবল দৃশ্যবর্ণনা নয়, ভাবগত ও আবেগগত স্তরও বাড়ায়। ঘ: প্রস্তাবিত প্রশ্নটি পাঠককে প্রতিশ্রুতি ও বাস্তবতার সম্পর্ক নিয়ে গভীরভাবে ভাবতে উৎসাহিত করবে।

Question:
Imagine a short free-verse couplet: "Midnight wind negotiates the alleys—no signatures at the door. Lanterns keep the ledger of leaves and unreturned favors; their light is impartial, listing what came and what left. Somewhere a laugh is archived like a lost invoice." Use this scene to answer the four parts below.

Options:
ক. এই couplet-এর মূল ভাবটি একটি বাক্যে ব্যাখ্যা করো।
খ. কবিতার কোন লাইনটি সর্বোচ্চ তীব্রতা (punch) দেয়—চ্যান্ট বা ব্যাখ্যাসহ চিহ্নিত করো।
গ. একটি নতুন লাইন সংযোজন করো যা অনুচ্ছেদের অর্থ বজায় রেখে বন্ধুত্বের ভঙ্গি আরেকভাবে বলে দেবে (এক সারির নতুন লাইনের উদাহরণ লেখো)।
ঘ. এই টুকটাক দৃশ্য থেকে একটি সাহিত্যের অভিধানভিত্তিক (literary) বিশ্লেষণীয় মন্তব্য দাও (৩-৪ বাক্যে)।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক মূল ভাব: রাতের নীরব পরিবেশে স্মৃতি-লঘু অঙ্কন করে লুকোনো সামাজিক দেনা-প্রদান ও বন্ধুত্বের অনুপস্থিতি স্পষ্ট হয়।

খ সর্বোচ্চ তীব্রতা দিল এমন লাইন: "লেন্টার্নগুলো পাতা ও অপ্রত্যাবর্তিত উপকারের হিসাব রাখে; তাদের আলো নিরপেক্ষ।" কারণ এই লাইনটি কল্পনাকে মানবিক বিচারে নামিয়ে এনে, অনুভূতিগুলোকে 'হিসাব' হিসেবে দেখায়—এটাই কৌতুক ও তিক্ততার মিশ্র ধাক্কা সৃষ্টি করে।

গ নতুন সংযোজিত লাইন (উদাহরণ): "দেনার খাতা ঘুরে বেড়ায়, কিন্তু কোনো স্বাক্ষর নেই—শুধু ফাঁকা কলামের স্মৃতি।" (এই লাইন বন্ধুত্বের প্রতিশ্রুতি এবং স্বীকৃতির অনুপস্থিতি দুটোই রঙিনভাবে ফুটিয়ে তোলে।)

ঘ বিশ্লেষণীয় মন্তব্য: কবিতাটি রাত্রি-উপকরণকে প্রশাসনিক শৈলীতে ব্যবহার করে (লেদ্জার, ইনভয়েস, হিসাব) এবং তাতে মানব সম্পর্কের আর্থিক উপমা যোগ করে; এর ফলে বন্ধুত্বকে সামান্য ও পরিমাপযোগ্য কিছু হিসেবে উপস্থাপন করা হয়। ব্যক্তিকরণ ও অর্থবিদ্যার সংমিশ্রণ পাঠককে সম্পর্কের মূল্যায়ন সম্পর্কে নরম এক তীক্ষ্ণতা দেয়—যেখানে আবেগকে রেকর্ড ও অতিরিক্তীকরণ করা হয়।

Explanation:
ক: এক বাক্যে মূল থিম ধরা হয়েছে—রাত্রি ও স্মৃতির মাধ্যমে সামাজিক তফাৎ প্রকাশ। খ: নির্বাচিত লাইনটি উপলব্ধি এবং চমক দান করে কারণ এটি বিমর্ষ বিষয়ে একটি বিচক্ষণ রূপ দেয়। গ: নতুন লাইনটি বিদ্যমান মেজাজ ও উপমা বজায় রেখে বন্ধুত্বের ক্ষয়কে আরও ব্যাখ্যা করে। ঘ: বিশ্লেষণে কবিতার কৌশল (অপভ্রংশ/উপমা, ব্যক্তিকরণ) ও তা থেকে সৃষ্ট সাংস্কৃতিক ও আবেগগত প্রভাব তুলে ধরা হয়েছে।

Question:
From a cramped jail cell, Martin Luther King Jr. composed a powerful reply to critics that would later be read around the world. His imprisonment crystallized his moral position: he became both strategist and symbol for a movement demanding equal rights. Facing charges after leading peaceful demonstrations, King's 'Letter from Birmingham Jail' argued that unjust laws are no laws at all and that waiting passively for justice is no longer acceptable. He insisted on the urgency of direct, nonviolent action. Praised as 'Dr. King,' he was lauded for courage, dignity, and an unwavering commitment to justice.

Question:
My name is Sofia. I'm 14 and I live most nights in the metro tunnels because my stepfather threw me out after I argued with him. I sell small trinkets and sometimes help a shopkeeper wash dishes for a bit to eat. I miss school — the homework sits in a backpack I left behind. At night, rats move through the trash, and the air smells of diesel and damp concrete. A few kind commuters have given me coins and once a woman offered to call a shelter but I was too afraid to go. I feel lonely and tired, and I try to hide my cuts under long sleeves.

Options:
ক. Write a one-sentence summary of Sofia's situation.
খ. List three root causes of Sofia's homelessness as implied by the passage.
গ. Identify two emotions Sofia expresses and cite the phrases that show them.
ঘ. Suggest two practical actions a local youth charity could take to help Sofia right away.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Sofia, a 14-year-old forced from home by her stepfather, is living in metro tunnels, surviving by selling trinkets and doing small jobs, missing school and hiding injuries.খ 1) Family conflict/abuse: implied by "threw me out after I argued with him." 2) Fear and mistrust of institutions: she was "too afraid to go" when offered help from a shelter. 3) Economic insecurity: she must "sell small trinkets" and do dishwashing for food, indicating poverty and lack of stable income.গ 1) Loneliness — shown by "I feel lonely and tired." 2) Fear/anxiety — shown by "I was too afraid to go" (to the shelter) and by hiding cuts under "long sleeves."ঘ 1) Outreach and trust-building: send a trained youth outreach worker who visits the metro tunnel regularly to build rapport, offer immediate essentials (warm blanket, hygiene kit), and explain shelter options in a non-threatening way. 2) Short-term stabilization and school liaison: provide an emergency place to stay for a few nights while coordinating with local schools/social services to retrieve records and create a plan to re-enroll or offer alternative education support.

Explanation:
For the summary (ক) I condensed the core facts: age, cause (forced out), living place, survival strategies, and missed schooling. For root causes (খ) I inferred issues that typically lead to youth homelessness from phrases in the text: family rejection/abuse, economic need, and fear of institutions. For emotions (গ) I picked explicit wording showing feelings and matched them to the indicated lines. For practical actions (ঘ) I recommended immediate, low-barrier interventions (outreach, essentials) and a next step linking to education and services — both are commonly effective and directly respond to Sofia's stated needs and fears.

Question:
My name is Malik, I'm 12. I used to sleep at my uncle's small borrowed room after my mother left, but the landlord evicted us when he needed the place back. I now hawk newspapers every morning and sleep on a bench near the fish market. My hands are often stiff from the cold and my feet hurt from walking all day. I once asked my aunt for help but she said she couldn't afford another mouth to feed. I write letters I never send, hoping someone will read and care.

Options:
ক. Create a short headline (3–7 words) that captures Malik's story.
খ. Outline the sequence of events that led Malik to the bench by the fish market (three steps).
গ. List two physical hardships he mentions and explain why each is a risk.
ঘ. Compose a 20–30 word compassionate note a volunteer could give Malik that acknowledges him and offers help.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Evicted Boy Sells Papers to Surviveখ 1) Mother's departure left him living with his uncle; 2) The landlord evicted them to reclaim the room; 3) After eviction, Malik began selling newspapers and sleeping on a bench near the fish market to survive.গ 1) Stiff hands from the cold — risk: prolonged exposure to cold can cause hypothermia or reduce circulation, impairing his ability to work. 2) Sore feet from walking all day — risk: chronic foot pain can lead to mobility problems, infections from blisters, and reduced ability to earn money or seek help.ঘ "Hi Malik — I see how hard you're working. There's a shelter/outreach group nearby with warm meals and help to find stable sleep or schooling. Want me to go with you?"

Explanation:
For the headline (ক) I condensed the narrative focus into a short phrase emphasizing eviction and survival work. The sequence (খ) follows causal steps explicitly described: family change, eviction, street life. Physical hardships (গ) are direct mentions; their risks are standard health consequences of cold exposure and overuse injuries. The compassionate note (ঘ) is brief, validates his effort, offers concrete help (shelter/meal), and reduces the barrier by offering accompaniment — an approach proven to increase uptake among street-involved youth.

Question:
My name is Lina, I'm 15 and I work nights at a laundromat so I can send money home. I used to go to school but now I miss most classes. Once I cut my palm on a rusty nail while carrying heavy laundry baskets and no one paid for my clinic visit. I dream of finishing my exams, but I feel trapped between helping my family and getting an education. Sometimes I lie awake worrying about bills and whether my mother will be okay if I stop working.

Options:
ক. Provide a two-sentence summary of Lina's dilemma.
খ. Identify two immediate health and safety hazards in Lina's account and explain the concern for each.
গ. Recommend one immediate priority intervention and one medium-term plan to support Lina's goals.
ঘ. Rewrite Lina's first sentence to sound more hopeful while keeping the same facts.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Lina, a 15-year-old who works night shifts at a laundromat to support her family, has fallen behind in school and was injured at work without medical support, leaving her torn between earning and studying. She wants to finish her exams but feels trapped by financial responsibility and worry about her mother's wellbeing.খ 1) Cut on a rusty nail — concern: risk of tetanus or infection without prompt medical care, which can lead to serious illness. 2) Working heavy night shifts — concern: physical strain and sleep deprivation increase risk of accidents, impaired concentration (affecting safety at work and learning), and long-term health problems.গ Immediate priority: Arrange prompt medical care (wound cleaning, tetanus shot if needed) and provide at least short-term financial relief (small cash grant or food support) so Lina can rest and recover. Medium-term plan: Connect Lina with a program that offers flexible schooling or evening classes combined with a youth stipend or part-time sheltered employment, enabling her to complete exams while contributing to family income safely.ঘ "I'm Lina, 15, and I work nights at a laundromat to send money home while pursuing my studies whenever I can."

Explanation:
The summary (ক) captures the central conflict: earning versus education and a recent injury. Health/safety hazards (খ) are identified from explicit details and linked to standard medical risks (infection, tetanus, and the harms of overwork/sleep loss). The immediate intervention (গ) prioritizes medical care because untreated wounds can escalate; short-term financial help reduces pressure so she can recover. The medium-term plan addresses systemic needs: flexible education and safer income options. For the hopeful rewrite (ঘ) I kept facts intact but added a forward-looking verb "pursuing" to emphasize agency and aspiration.

Question:
A vertical bar chart displays the municipal solid waste (MSW) generated by five sectors in a mid-sized city during 2024. The five sectors are Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Construction, and Agricultural. The chart gives amounts in tonnes: Residential 350, Commercial 220, Industrial 180, Construction 120, Agricultural 60. Use this context to answer the sub-questions below.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: The bar chart shows municipal solid waste generation by five sectors in 2024 with clear numeric totals: Residential 350 tonnes, Commercial 220 tonnes, Industrial 180 tonnes, Construction 120 tonnes, and Agricultural 60 tonnes. The chart's main feature is that the Residential sector is the dominant source, producing more waste than the other four combined. The Commercial sector is the second largest contributor, considerably higher than Industrial and Construction. Industrial and Construction produce moderate amounts, while Agricultural waste is minimal in comparison. The distribution is skewed toward household-related sources (Residential + Commercial = 570 tonnes), indicating urban consumption and commerce as primary drivers of MSW. This pattern suggests that waste management policies should prioritize household and commercial waste collection, recycling, and reduction programs.খ উত্তর: Comparing the top two sectors—Residential (350 tonnes) and Commercial (220 tonnes)—Residential exceeds Commercial by 130 tonnes, which is nearly 59% more. Reasons: households generate diverse daily waste (food scraps, packaging, discarded goods) across many thousands of homes, while commercial waste is concentrated in business districts and often more uniform (packaging, paper). Residential waste also has higher frequency and dispersion, making collection and segregation harder. Thus, Residential is the larger problem in absolute terms and requires more resources for door-to-door collection, public awareness, and household-level segregation programs.গ উত্তর: Three effective policies: 1) Mandatory source segregation and pay-as-you-throw (PAYT): Require households and businesses to separate recyclables, organics, and residuals; charge fees based on the volume/weight of residual waste. This incentivizes reduction and recycling. 2) Expanded recycling and organic composting facilities: Invest in local MRFs (material recovery facilities) and composting sites for organic waste from Residential and Commercial streams, diverting large fractions from landfills. 3) Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for packaging: Enforce regulations that make producers responsible for post-consumer packaging collection and recycling, reducing packaging volume entering the municipal stream and shifting costs to producers.ঘ উত্তর: Three potential impacts: 1) Environmental degradation: High residential waste increases landfill use, causing methane emissions, leachate risk to groundwater, and local pollution if unmanaged. 2) Strain on municipal services: Large and dispersed household waste volumes demand greater collection frequency, vehicles, labor, and disposal capacity, increasing municipal budgets and logistical complexity. 3) Public health risks: Improperly handled organic and mixed residential waste attracts pests and creates vectors for disease, especially where collection is inconsistent—this raises healthcare and sanitation costs and necessitates emergency interventions.

Explanation:
The solution reads the bar chart values and interprets relative magnitudes. For (ক) it summarizes distribution and highlights that residential and commercial together dominate MSW. For (খ) it computes the absolute and percentage difference and explains behavioral causes. For (গ) the suggested policies address roots (incentives, infrastructure, producer responsibility) and are commonly recommended for urban waste management. For (ঘ) the impacts follow logically from unchecked waste volumes: environmental, administrative, and public health consequences.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: The four sources show different monthly trends. Traffic noise rises from 65 dB in January to a peak of 80 dB in July, then declines toward year-end. Construction noise begins low and climbs sharply to a July peak around 74 dB, then falls. Nightlife noise has a pronounced seasonal rise peaking in August at about 70 dB. Industry noise is relatively steady, slowly rising to 61 dB mid-year and remaining roughly constant. The highest absolute peak among all sources is Traffic at 80 dB in July, making traffic the single largest monthly contributor at that time.খ উত্তর: June–August comparison: Traffic values are June 78, July 80, August 79; Construction values are June 70, July 74, August 73. Traffic is consistently 8–6 dB higher than Construction in these months, so Traffic is more impactful. Reasons include increased vehicle volumes in summer (tourism, commuting), possibly roadworks that slow traffic and increase engine noise, and the broader spatial footprint of traffic compared to localized construction sites. Even though construction shows big relative increases, its absolute levels remain below traffic during these months.গ উত্তর: Three measures: 1) Traffic calming and modal shift during peak months: Implement temporary reduced-speed zones, congestion pricing, and improved public transit to reduce vehicle numbers and speeds—lower speeds decrease noise emissions significantly. 2) Time-restricted construction permits: Limit heavy machinery operation to daytime off-peak hours and enforce quieter construction techniques (electric equipment, noise barriers) during summer peaks. 3) Nighttime entertainment zoning and soundproofing incentives: Require nightlife venues to install acoustic insulation and enforce strict outdoor speaker curfews during high-noise months. Each reduces either source intensity or exposure time, thereby lowering population noise exposure.ঘ উত্তর: Nightlife peaks in July–August (rising to about 70 dB in August) and thus deserves greatest attention in dense residential entertainment districts during summer. Reasons: summertime brings more outdoor events, tourism, and longer evenings, increasing nocturnal exposure and sleep disturbance. Targeting neighborhoods with mixed land use (bars next to apartments) and enforcing curfews, outdoor sound limits, and mandatory venue insulation will yield the greatest benefit for community sleep and well-being.

Explanation:
The solution inspects numerical monthly series, identifies peaks and timing, and compares sources using absolute dB differences (recognizing that +10 dB roughly doubles perceived loudness). Mitigation measures are chosen to reduce source strength, exposure time, or population exposure and are justified by how they affect the plotted trends.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: The pie chart attributes urban water pollution primarily to Agricultural runoff (40%), followed by Untreated sewage (30%), Industrial effluents (18%), Plastic debris (8%), and Others (4%). The structure shows non-point source pollution from agriculture as the largest single contributor, with point-source pollution from sewage and industry also significant. Combined, agricultural runoff and untreated sewage make up 70% of total pollution, indicating that nutrient loading (fertilizers, pesticides) and human waste are dominant issues for water quality in this coastal city.খ উত্তর: Priority should be given to Agricultural runoff and Untreated sewage. Agricultural runoff (40%) is the single largest source and often causes eutrophication through nitrogen and phosphorus—this can rapidly degrade water quality across wide areas. Untreated sewage (30%) directly increases pathogenic contamination and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), posing immediate human health risks and harming aquatic life. Addressing these two sources yields the largest marginal improvements because together they account for the majority of pollution and affect both ecological and public health outcomes.গ উত্তর: To reduce Agricultural runoff: 1) Implement riparian buffer zones and constructed wetlands to intercept nutrients before they reach waterways; 2) Promote precision agriculture and controlled fertilizer application (timing and amounts) plus cover cropping to minimize runoff. To reduce Untreated sewage: 1) Expand and upgrade wastewater treatment infrastructure with staged implementation (primary→secondary→tertiary) focusing on hotspots; 2) Implement decentralized treatment in informal settlements (e.g., community-scale treatment plants, septic management programs) while enforcing connections to sewers. Each measure targets the pathway by which pollutants enter water and is scalable to municipal budgets and timelines.ঘ উত্তর: Two likely impacts on coastal biodiversity: 1) Eutrophication and dead zones: Excess nutrients from agricultural runoff can trigger algal blooms; when algae die and decompose, oxygen is consumed, creating hypoxic conditions that kill fish and benthic organisms and reduce habitat complexity. 2) Pathogen loads and toxic contamination: Untreated sewage increases pathogen concentrations and organic pollution, harming shellfish and other filter feeders and making seafood unsafe for humans; industrial effluents may introduce heavy metals or toxins that bioaccumulate, affecting predators and ecosystem health.

Explanation:
The answers interpret percentage shares to prioritize interventions and propose practical mitigation strategies targeted to pollution pathways (runoff interception, precision farming, wastewater treatment expansion).

ঘ. এমন সমাজ গঠনের জন্য আপনি কোন বাস্তব কাজগুলো করবেন?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তরে: একটি ভাল সমাজ হলো এমন একটি সম্প্রদায় যেখানে প্রযুক্তি মানুষ এবং পরিবেশের কল্যাণে ব্যবহার হয়, সকল নাগরিকের মৌলিক চাহিদা—স্বাস্থ্যসেবা, শিক্ষা, বাসস্থান—নিশ্চিত করা হয় এবং ব্যক্তি-মুক্তি ও সম্মান বজায় থাকে। এখানে উন্নত প্রযুক্তি শুদ্ধ বাতাস, নিরাপদ পানি ও দক্ষ বিদ্যুৎ সরবরাহ করে; কিন্তু সেই প্রযুক্তি মানুষকে প্রতিস্থাপিত করে না, বরং তাঁদের জীবনমান উন্নত করে।

খ উত্তরে: ন্যায়সংগতির প্রধান দিকগুলো হলো সমতাভিত্তিক সুযোগ, প্রবেশযোগ্য পরিষেবা, অন্তর্ভুক্তিমূলক নীতি এবং স্বচ্ছ অংশগ্রহণ। অর্থাৎ শিক্ষায়, চাকরিতে ও স্বাস্থ্যসেবায় সকলের সমান প্রবেশাধিকার, দুর্বলদের জন্য নিরাপত্তা ও সমর্থন, এবং সিদ্ধান্ত প্রক্রিয়ায় নাগরিক অংশগ্রহণ নিশ্চিত করতে হবে। পরিবেশগত ন্যায়ও গুরুত্বপূর্ণ: কার্বন বণ্টন, সবুজ স্থানকেন্দ্রিক নীতি ও প্রযুক্তি সুবিধার ন্যায্য বণ্টন।

গ উত্তরে: আমার ভূমিকা হবে সচেতন নাগরিক ও উৎসাহিতকারী হিসেবে কাজ করা — নীতি-নির্ধারক ও কমিউনিটি গ্রুপে অংশ নিয়ে উদ্ভাবনী সমাধান প্রচার করা, প্রযুক্তি ও পরিবেশগত নীতির মধ্যে সমন্বয় সাধন করা, এবং দুর্বল সম্প্রদায়ের কণ্ঠস্বর তুলে ধরা। আমি শিক্ষা কর্মসূচি চালাব যাতে মানুষ ডিজিটাল দক্ষতা ও পরিবেশ সচেতনতা অর্জন করে এবং প্রযুক্তি ব্যবহারে নৈতিকতা শিখতে পারে।

ঘ উত্তরে: বাস্তবে আমি কমিউনিটি ওয়ার্কশপ, স্বেচ্ছাসেবা প্রোজেক্ট ও অনলাইন প্রচারণার মাধ্যমে কাজ করব। শহরের পরিকল্পনায় অংশগ্রহণের জন্য স্টেকহোল্ডার মিটিংয়ে I'll volunteer and propose pilot প্রকল্প — যেমন কমিউনিটি-চালিত রিনিউওয়েবল মাইক্রোগ্রিড, উন্মুক্ত ডিজিটাল শিক্ষা কেন্দ্র এবং পার্সোনাল ডেটা রক্ষার নীতিমালা। পাশাপাশি স্থানীয় আইনপ্রণেতাদের কাছে ন্যায়সংগত বাজেট বরাদ্দ ও পরিবেশ-ন্যায়নীতির জন্য অনুরোধ জানাব।

Explanation:
এই সমাধানে প্রতিটি অংশে বোঝানো হয়েছে যে একটি প্রযুক্তিনির্ভর কিন্তু মানবমুখী সমাজ কেমন হওয়া উচিত: মৌলিক চাহিদা পূরণ, পরিবেশগত স্থিতিশীলতা এবং অংশগ্রহণভিত্তিক শাসন। ন্যায়সংগতির দিকগুলোতে কেবল অর্থনৈতিক সমতা নয়, পরিবেশ ও ডিজিটাল অনুমতির সমতা অন্তর্ভুক্ত করা হয়েছে। ব্যক্তিগত ভূমিকা এবং কার্যক্রমে আমার জোর ছিল কমিউনিটি অংশগ্রহণ, নীতিমালা প্রভাবিত করা এবং হাতে-কলমে প্রকল্প চালানো — এগুলো বাস্তব পরিবর্তনের জন্য প্রয়োজনীয় এবং নিরপেক্ষ কৌশল।

ঘ. গ্রামকে পরিবর্তিত ও টেকসই করতে আপনি কি রকম উদ্যোগ গ্রহণ করবেন?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তরে: গ্রামের সমাজ হওয়া উচিত আত্মনির্ভর, সহানুভূতিশীল ও সমবায়ভিত্তিক—যেখানে জমি, জল ও বনসম্পদকে দায়িত্বশীলভাবে ব্যবহার করা হয় এবং সমৃদ্ধি সব সদস্যকে ছড়িয়ে দেয়া হয়। শিক্ষা, স্বাস্থ্য ও সংস্কৃতি সক্রিয়ভাবে সমর্থিত হবে, এবং স্থানীয় জ্ঞান ও ঐতিহ্যকে আধুনিক প্রযুক্তির সঙ্গে সংহত করা হবে।

Question:
A neighbourhood consumer group collected samples from local markets after many shoppers complained about poor quality spices and milk. Laboratory screening suggested that some turmeric contained unusual bright pigments and several milk samples had lower density than expected. The group wants to prepare an awareness note for residents explaining the findings and what to do next.

Options:
ক. What is food adulteration? Give brief examples relevant to spices and milk.
খ. How are spices like turmeric and everyday foods such as milk commonly adulterated?
গ. What immediate and long-term health risks can arise from these specific adulterants?
ঘ. What practical steps can consumers and authorities take to reduce such adulteration?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Food adulteration is the deliberate addition, substitution or removal of substances in food that reduces its quality or safety for economic gain or fraud. Examples relevant here: turmeric mixed with lead chromate or metanil yellow to intensify color; powdered spices diluted with brick powder, starch, or colored sawdust; milk diluted with water, or mixed with vegetable oils, detergents, starch, or formalin to increase shelf-life or mimic viscosity.খ Common methods include: adding synthetic dyes or industrial pigments to turmeric and chili to enhance brightness; mixing cheap fillers (flour, starch, sand) into ground spices; adding water to milk to increase volume; stabilizers (starch, powdered milk solids) or preservatives (formalin) to mask dilution; blending milk with cheaper oils or reconstituted milk powder. Adulteration can occur at production, during milling, storage or at retail.গ Health risks: immediate effects may include stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions or food poisoning. Specific agents carry specific hazards — lead chromate causes neurotoxicity, developmental delays in children and kidney problems; formalin is a carcinogen and causes respiratory and gastrointestinal irritation; adulterants like brick dust cause intestinal abrasions or constipation. Chronic exposure raises risks of organ damage, impaired childhood development, and increased cancer risk.ঘ Practical steps: Consumers should buy from reputable sellers, check sensory cues (unusually bright color, gritty texture, watery milk), perform simple home tests (e.g., turmeric color test on filter paper, milk density checks) and prefer branded/lab-tested products. Authorities should enforce regular sampling and laboratory testing, impose strict penalties, train inspectors, require supplier traceability and publicize test results. Community awareness campaigns and easy complaint/reporting channels will help deter offenders.

Explanation:
This solution identifies adulteration, gives clear examples relevant to spices and milk, explains typical adulteration techniques, and links specific adulterants to their health impacts. The consumer actions focus on detection, safer buying habits and reporting, while authority actions cover testing, enforcement and transparency. The combination of immediate checks and structural regulatory measures is necessary because adulteration happens both at micro (seller) and macro (supply chain/regulatory) levels.

Question:
During a heatwave many people bought street-side fried snacks and later several cases of foodborne illness and complaints about rancid taste were reported. Health inspectors suspected that vendors were reusing oil, adding low-grade fats, and using stale ingredients to cut costs. The municipal health department must write guidance describing the problem and remedies.

Options:
ক. Describe the forms of adulteration and unhygienic practices common in street-food frying.
খ. Why might small vendors resort to such practices? Mention economic and knowledge-related factors.
গ. What acute and chronic health effects can result from consuming repeatedly reused oil and rancid foods?
ঘ. What steps should the municipal health department implement to protect public health while supporting small vendors?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Forms of adulteration and unhygienic practices in frying include: using repeatedly heated/recycled oil (which degrades and forms toxic breakdown products), blending edible oils with cheaper, low-quality fats or industrial oils, adding colorants or starch to extend batter, keeping raw materials beyond safe storage times, inadequate hand and utensil hygiene, and selling foods that were cooked earlier without proper reheating. These reduce quality and increase health hazards.খ Reasons vendors resort to these practices: economic pressure (thin profit margins, high cost of fresh oil and ingredients), lack of awareness about health risks and safe handling, absence of access to safe waste disposal and clean water, limited refrigeration, and competitive pressure to keep prices low. Inadequate training and weak enforcement also encourage cutting corners.গ Health effects: acutely, consumption of foods from degraded oil or contaminated items causes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and food poisoning. Reused oil contains polar compounds and trans fats that cause inflammation, oxidative stress and may increase risk of cardiovascular disease over time. Chronic intake of oxidized lipids is linked to liver damage, atherosclerosis and increased cancer risk. Foodborne pathogens from poor hygiene can cause severe infections, especially in vulnerable people.ঘ Municipal department actions: conduct regular inspections with graded certification (e.g., “hygiene-certified” stall signs); offer low-cost vendor training on safe frying practices, proper oil-management (when to change oil), storage and hygiene; provide or subsidize oil-recycling solutions and safe disposal; run public awareness so consumers prefer certified vendors; implement spot testing for oil quality and microbial contamination; and set realistic rules with supportive enforcement (warnings, training first, fines only for repeat offenders). These steps balance public health protection with livelihoods support.

Explanation:
The answer explains both the technical nature of frying-related adulteration (oil degradation, mixing with poor fats) and the socioeconomic drivers behind vendor behaviour. Health impacts distinguish between immediate foodborne harm and longer-term effects of consuming oxidized lipids. The policy recommendations are practical: combine inspection and testing with vendor education, certification, and consumer awareness to create incentives for safer practices without unduly harming small businesses.

Question:
An online consumer watchdog released a report showing that several popular packaged 'pure' honey and '100% fruit juice' products contained added syrups, artificial sweeteners, or were diluted with water. Labels were found misleading in many cases. The watchdog wants an educational brief explaining the issue and remedies.

Options:
ক. What constitutes adulteration and mislabeling in packaged foods like honey and fruit juices?
খ. What economic or supply-chain incentives drive manufacturers to produce such fraudulent products?
গ. How can consumers perform simple at-home checks to suspect adulteration, and what laboratory tests confirm it?
ঘ. What regulatory and industry measures reduce mislabeling and protect consumers?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Adulteration in packaged foods includes dilution (adding water to juice or honey), substitution (replacing expensive components with cheaper syrups such as high-fructose corn syrup), addition of undeclared sweeteners or preservatives, and use of non-food-grade additives. Mislabeling occurs when packaging claims like “pure”, “100% juice”, or “single-origin honey” are false, or when ingredients and origin are intentionally obscured. Both practices are deceptive and illegal in many jurisdictions.খ Economic and supply-chain incentives: cheaper sweeteners and syrups drastically reduce production costs and increase profit margins. Seasonal shortages, high raw-material prices, and pressure to meet consistent taste/appearance year-round push manufacturers to blend cheaper substitutes. Complex supply chains and weak traceability make it easier to mix ingredients without detection. Inadequate enforcement and low penalties further lower the risk of being caught.
গ Home checks: for honey—put a spoonful in water; pure honey tends to clump and not dissolve quickly, while diluted honey disperses; another test is flame: a dry match lights after dipping in pure honey but not if adulterated with water (careful with fire). For juice—visual inspection for uniformity, taste that seems overly sweet or syrupy, and checking for sediments or separation can raise suspicion. Laboratory tests: for honey—pollen analysis, carbon isotope ratio (to detect C4 plant syrups like corn syrup), HPLC for sugar profile; for juice—HPLC to identify specific sugars and markers, isotopic analysis, and tests for added sweeteners or preservatives. These tests reliably confirm adulteration.ঘ Regulatory and industry measures: require transparent labeling with ingredient percentages and origin, mandate batch testing and public disclosure of results, strengthen traceability across the supply chain, impose meaningful penalties for fraud, and encourage third-party certification and industry self-regulation (e.g., certified honey standards). Consumer education campaigns help buyers recognize trustworthy brands and labels. Retailers should audit suppliers and demand certificates of analysis to reduce fraudulent products entering the market.

Explanation:
This solution clarifies the difference between adulteration and mislabeling, highlights economic motivations, offers practical home-detection hints while noting their limits, and lists laboratory methods that definitively identify fraud. The policy suggestions emphasize traceability, testing, penalties and market incentives (certification, retailer audits) because technical detection combined with system-level checks is most effective at preventing packaged-food fraud.

Question:
Context: With the rapid growth of image-centered platforms, many adolescents spend extended time on Instagram-like apps. Schools and parents are concerned about how these platforms shape self-image, creativity, and peer relationships.

Options:
ক. Write a paragraph of about 200 words on "Instagram and Teen Body Image."
খ. List four positive effects and four negative effects of image-based social media on teenagers (brief bullet points).
গ. Recommend three school policies that could help reduce negative impacts while preserving creative benefits.
ঘ. Propose a short awareness campaign title and two student activities that would promote healthy use of image-based apps.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer:
Instagram and similar image-centered platforms influence teen body image in complex ways. On the positive side, they allow young people to discover diverse aesthetics, niche communities, and body-positive creators who challenge traditional beauty norms; this exposure can broaden ideals and foster self-expression. However, much of the content is highly curated, edited, and filtered, creating an environment where comparison is frequent and unrealistic standards seem normal. Continuous viewing of idealized images can increase appearance anxiety, reduce self-esteem, and prompt unhealthy behaviors such as extreme dieting or excessive cosmetic concern. Algorithms that prioritize engagement often amplify sensational or idealized imagery, reinforcing narrow standards. Peer feedback mechanisms—likes, comments, and follower counts—turn appearance into a measurable social currency, which can heighten pressure to conform. Mitigating these harms requires media literacy: teaching teens to recognize editing, understand how algorithms shape feeds, and critically evaluate the authenticity of posts. Encouraging creation of authentic content, promoting diverse role models, and providing supportive spaces where teens can discuss their feelings about appearance helps preserve Instagram’s creative benefits while protecting mental health.

খ Answer:
Positive effects:
1. Inspiration for creative photography, fashion, and art.
2. Access to body-positive and diversity-focused communities.
3. Easier social connection and identity exploration.
4. Platforms for self-expression and showcasing talents.

Negative effects:
1. Increased body dissatisfaction from comparing to edited images.
2. Pressure for validation via likes and follower counts.
3. Exposure to unrealistic beauty standards and harmful trends.
4. Risk of cyberbullying and negative comments about appearance.

গ Answer:
1. Media Literacy Curriculum: Incorporate a mandatory module that teaches image editing recognition, algorithm awareness, and critical consumption strategies.
2. Digital Well-being Breaks: Implement scheduled device-free times (e.g., first 20 minutes after arrival or before exams) and promote offline creative activities (art, sports).
3. Safe Reporting and Support System: Establish an easily accessible system for reporting appearance-based harassment and provide counseling sessions focused on self-esteem and social media coping strategies.

ঘ Answer:
Campaign Title: "See Beyond the Filter"
Activity 1: "Authenticity Gallery" — Students take unedited self-portraits and create a school exhibition with captions about what they value beyond appearance.
Activity 2: "Filter Detective Workshop" — Small groups analyze a set of influencer photos to identify common editing techniques and discuss how captions/angles affect perception.

Explanation:
Reasoning:
For ক: The paragraph balances positives and negatives and emphasizes media literacy, which research shows helps reduce harmful comparison. It avoids prescribing a single solution and highlights algorithmic effects and peer validation mechanisms.
For খ: The lists distill common findings from studies on visual social media: creativity and community benefits versus comparison, validation pressure, and harassment.
For গ: Proposed policies focus on education, structural changes to daily routine, and support services—practical items schools can implement without banning platforms.
For ঘ: The campaign title is short and memorable. The activities are experiential: the gallery fosters acceptance; the detective workshop builds critical skills to spot manipulation. These approaches encourage reflection and skill-building rather than punitive measures.

Question:
Context: A local youth center surveys how YouTube and video platforms shape teenagers’ learning habits, career interests, and time use. Staff want materials to help teens use video content for learning while avoiding misinformation and distraction.

Options:
ক. Write a 150-word paragraph on the educational benefits of YouTube for teenagers.
খ. Identify three common risks associated with relying on video platforms for learning and propose one specific mitigation for each risk.
গ. List five clear criteria teenagers should use to evaluate whether a YouTube channel is a reliable learning source.
ঘ. Draft a short guideline (6–8 lines) parents can follow to support their teen's productive use of educational videos.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer:
YouTube offers teenagers an accessible, on-demand reservoir of instructional content that complements formal schooling. Short tutorials, demonstrations, and explainers make abstract concepts tangible by showing step-by-step procedures—useful for subjects like science experiments, coding, music, and language practice. Visual and auditory formats accommodate diverse learning styles; learners can pause, rewind, and replay difficult segments, enabling self-paced study. Exposure to experts, practitioners, and global perspectives can broaden career aspirations and provide role models beyond the local community. Additionally, project-based channels inspire hands-on learning, while playlists and series provide structured pathways through complex topics. When combined with critical thinking about sources, YouTube is a powerful informal classroom that can spark curiosity, build practical skills, and motivate continued learning outside school hours.

খ Answer:
Risk 1: Misinformation — Mitigation: Cross-check facts with reputable sources (textbooks, educational institutions, peer-reviewed articles) and prefer channels that cite sources.
Risk 2: Distraction and Time Sink — Mitigation: Use curated playlists and set a timer or study schedule; use "watch later" lists for non-urgent videos.
Risk 3: Incomplete or Poor Pedagogy — Mitigation: Combine videos with guided notes or teacher-reviewed worksheets; choose channels with clear learning objectives and progressive series.

গ Answer:
Five evaluation criteria:
1. Source transparency: creator’s credentials and affiliations are visible.
2. Citation and evidence: videos reference studies, sources, or supporting materials.
3. Consistency and pedagogy: content is structured logically with clear learning goals.
4. Production quality and clarity: audio/visual clarity and accurate captions/transcripts.
5. Community and feedback: constructive comments, expert endorsements, and updates/corrections visible.

ঘ Answer:
Parent Guideline:
1. Discuss learning goals before watching: ask what your teen hopes to learn.
2. Encourage use of playlists or vetted channels recommended by teachers.
3. Set time limits and combine videos with hands-on practice or note-taking.
4. Teach your teen to check creator credentials and look for cited sources.
5. Watch together occasionally and ask probing questions to promote critical thinking.
6. Promote balance—videos for learning, plus offline study and rest.

Explanation:
Reasoning:
For ক: Focuses on how video format supports varied learning styles and self-paced study, and how exposure to practitioners can expand career thinking—concise and targeted to teenagers.
For খ: Each risk is common in the research literature; each mitigation is practical and actionable (cross-checking, scheduling, pairing with teacher input).
For গ: The five criteria are actionable checks teens can use quickly to judge reliability without advanced media training.
For ঘ: Guidelines are short, parent-friendly, and combine supervision with autonomy, emphasizing goal-setting, verification, and balance.

Question:
Context: Increasing smartphone use among high school students is linked to poorer sleep, distracted studying, and changing face-to-face interactions. A school committee needs materials to help students develop healthier digital habits without stigmatizing device use.

Options:
ক. Write a paragraph (about 180 words) describing causes of smartphone overuse among teens and its main consequences.
খ. Provide six practical, research-backed tips students can follow to reduce screen time and improve sleep.
গ. Design a one-week digital detox plan (daily tasks) suitable for busy students.
ঘ. Explain three ways teachers can integrate technology positively into lessons to reduce off-task smartphone use.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer:
Smartphone overuse in teens arises from a mix of social, psychological, and technological factors. Social incentives—instant messaging, social validation via likes, and fear of missing out—create strong motivations to stay continually connected. Smartphones are engineered for engagement: endless feeds, variable rewards, and push notifications trigger dopamine-driven habits. Emotional factors like boredom, stress, or loneliness make teens seek quick mood boosts online. Finally, academic demands sometimes require online coordination and research, blurring boundaries between work and leisure. Consequences include disrupted sleep due to late-night screen exposure and blue light interfering with circadian rhythms, leading to daytime fatigue and reduced concentration. Persistent multitasking with phones impairs deep study, lowers academic performance, and increases time needed to complete tasks. Socially, excessive device use can reduce face-to-face communication skills and increase feelings of isolation despite being constantly 'connected.' In some cases, overuse correlates with anxiety and depressive symptoms, particularly when online interactions are negative or comparative.

খ Answer:
Six practical tips:
1. Set a consistent bedtime tech curfew (e.g., devices off 60 minutes before sleep).
2. Use "Do Not Disturb" or app timers to block notifications during study blocks.
3. Create phone-free zones/times (mealtimes, first 30 minutes after waking).
4. Replace phone checks with short rituals (stretching, journaling) to break habitual use.
5. Turn off non-essential push notifications or use grayscale mode to reduce visual appeal.
6. Track screen time weekly and set gradual reduction goals with rewards for meeting them.

গ Answer:
One-week Digital Detox Plan:
Day 1 (Monday): Establish baseline—install a screen-time tracker and record daily averages.
Day 2 (Tuesday): Implement study blocks—use 45/15 (45 minutes focused study, 15-minute break) with phone in another room during blocks.
Day 3 (Wednesday): Notification audit—turn off all non-essential notifications and delete one distracting app.
Day 4 (Thursday): Social swap—replace 1 hour of evening scrolling with a social activity (call a friend or family time).
Day 5 (Friday): Evening curfew—set devices to airplane mode 60 minutes before bed; read or relax offline instead.
Day 6 (Saturday): Outdoor day—spend at least 90 minutes outside with phone on silent; use it only for photos.
Day 7 (Sunday): Reflection and plan—review tracked data, celebrate improvements, and set realistic rules for next week.

ঘ Answer:
Three teacher strategies to integrate technology positively:
1. Structured Tech Tasks: Assign device-based activities with clear, time-bound goals (e.g., a 20-minute research mini-lesson with a shared rubric) so devices serve a purpose and timing is controlled.
2. Collaborative Platforms: Use collaborative apps (shared documents, digital whiteboards) that require active participation; monitor progress in real time to discourage off-task browsing.
3. Tech-Free Active Learning: Alternate digital tasks with low-tech kinesthetic or discussion activities—this contrast increases engagement and reduces the impulse to check phones during class.

Explanation:
Reasoning:
For ক: The paragraph identifies multi-layered causes (social, design, emotional, academic) and ties them to specific consequences like sleep disruption and impaired attention, reflecting prevailing evidence.
For খ: Tips draw on sleep hygiene (curfews), behavioral strategies (notifications, app timers), habit substitution, and self-monitoring—methods supported by behavior-change research.
For গ: The one-week plan is realistic for busy students: baseline measurement, incremental changes, practical swaps, and reflection to encourage sustainable habits.
For ঘ: Teacher strategies emphasize purposeful, time-limited tech use, collaborative accountability, and alternating modalities—approaches that harness technology for learning while reducing off-task use.

Question:
You are preparing to join a multinational company's weekly team meeting. Colleagues are from different cultural backgrounds and include senior managers, new hires, and remote participants. You want to present yourself professionally, avoid unintended rudeness, and contribute effectively without dominating the discussion.

Options:
ক. What is the difference between 'etiquette' and 'manners' in the context of a professional meeting?
খ. Give three concrete examples of poor manners commonly seen in meetings and explain why each is problematic.
গ. Why do meeting etiquette and acceptable behaviour vary across cultures? Give two reasons with brief examples.
ঘ. List four practical tips to improve your meeting etiquette when interacting with a multicultural team.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: In a professional meeting, 'etiquette' refers to the formal rules or conventions that govern conduct (e.g., raising a hand to speak, following an agenda, starting on time). 'Manners' are the softer, interpersonal behaviours showing politeness and respect (e.g., listening attentively, not interrupting, using courteous language). Etiquette is prescriptive and often documented; manners are habitual and reflect personal courtesy.খ Answer: 1) Constantly interrupting others — problematic because it signals disrespect, disrupts flow, and may silence quieter participants. 2) Checking phone or laptop for unrelated messages — problematic because it appears disengaged and distracts both you and others. 3) Speaking in a dismissive or sarcastic tone toward suggestions — problematic as it damages trust, reduces collaboration, and can escalate conflict.গ Answer: 1) Different cultural norms about hierarchy and deference — in some cultures, juniors rarely speak up when seniors are present, while in others open debate is encouraged. Example: direct disagreement may be acceptable in low-power-distance cultures but rude in high-power-distance cultures. 2) Variations in communication styles — some cultures value brevity and directness, others value indirectness and face-saving. Example: blunt feedback can be seen as efficient in one culture and insulting in another.ঘ Answer: 1) Learn the meeting norms beforehand (start/stop times, decision process). 2) Practice active listening: let others finish, paraphrase key points, and ask clarifying questions. 3) Use inclusive language and invite input from quieter members (e.g., "I’d like to hear your thoughts, X"). 4) Manage technology politely: mute when not speaking, avoid unrelated browsing, and explain if you must step away.

Explanation:
This scenario separates formal conventions (etiquette) from individual polite behaviors (manners). The examples of poor manners target common real-world meeting disruptions and explain their negative effects. Cultural variation arises from differences in hierarchy and communication preferences; understanding these helps prevent misunderstandings. The tips are practical, easy to adopt, and focused on respect, inclusion, and professional use of technology.

Question:
You have been invited to join an online study group that includes friends from other countries. The group communicates via messaging apps, video calls, and shared documents. You notice different expectations about response time, use of emojis, and giving feedback on drafts.

Options:
ক. Describe how 'digital etiquette' differs from traditional face-to-face etiquette.
খ. Provide three examples of respectful digital manners suitable for a mixed international group.
গ. Identify two common misunderstandings that arise from tone in written messages and suggest how to avoid them.
ঘ. Create a short 4-point guideline the group can adopt to set shared expectations for online collaboration.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: Digital etiquette focuses on norms for mediated communication—timeliness of replies, clarity in writing, appropriate use of multimedia, and behavior in virtual meetings. Unlike face-to-face etiquette, digital etiquette must compensate for missing nonverbal cues and asynchronous interactions, so it emphasizes explicit signals (e.g., status messages, read receipts) and clarity of intent.খ Answer: 1) Use clear subject lines and message headings for documents and threads so others know the topic and urgency. 2) When giving feedback on drafts, use constructive, specific comments and suggest alternatives rather than vague criticism. 3) Respect time zones: set reasonable windows for expecting replies and mark messages as urgent only when necessary; when sending outside normal hours, acknowledge that it may be read later.গ Answer: 1) Misread tone: short messages can seem curt even if not intended. Avoid by adding brief polite phrases or emojis where appropriate to convey friendliness. 2) Overuse of humor or sarcasm may not translate across cultures. Avoid ambiguous jokes; if you use humor, ensure the context is safe and consider adding clarifying markers (e.g., "just kidding").ঘ Answer: Group guideline: 1) State your local time zone in your profile and respect others' working hours. 2) Use clear subject lines and threaded replies; label urgent items as "URGENT." 3) Give feedback with specific, kind comments and propose solutions. 4) Mute video calls when not speaking and use a brief check-in when you join or leave to acknowledge participation.

Explanation:
Digital interactions lack face-to-face cues, so etiquette must make norms explicit and reduce ambiguity. Respectful digital manners reduce friction in collaboration. Tone-related misunderstandings are common due to absent vocal and facial signals; strategies like clarity, cautious humor, and explicit markers (politeness words or emojis used sparingly) help. The four-point guideline balances clarity, respect, and practicality for an international study group.

Question:
You are traveling and invited to dine at homes in several countries. Each host explains that table customs differ: in some places it's polite to finish everything, in others leaving a little food signals satisfaction; in some cultures diners use hands, in others utensils. You want to avoid offending your hosts and show appreciation.

Options:
ক. Summarize why understanding local dining etiquette matters when visiting someone's home.
খ. List four distinct dining manners or etiquette rules from different cultures (each briefly identified by region or country).
গ. If you are unsure about a specific custom during a meal, what three polite strategies can you use to navigate the situation?
ঘ. Write a short, polite phrase (one sentence) you can use to express gratitude at the end of the meal that is culturally neutral and unlikely to offend.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Answer: Understanding local dining etiquette matters because eating rituals express cultural values and respect; following them shows appreciation for the host, avoids accidental insults, facilitates social bonding, and helps you participate comfortably in communal activities.খ Answer: 1) Japan — wait for the host to say "Itadakimasu" and lift bowls close to your mouth; slurping noodles is acceptable and shows enjoyment. 2) India (many regions) — using the right hand for eating is customary; leaving a small amount can be polite in some contexts. 3) Middle East — eating with hands (often communal dishes) is normal; many hosts serve guests first and insist on hospitality. 4) Western Europe (e.g., France) — keep hands visible on the table (not in your lap), and use utensils consistently; finishing everything may be polite or neutral depending on the host.গ Answer: 1) Observe what the host and majority of guests do and follow their lead. 2) Ask a brief, respectful question if a specific action is unclear (e.g., "Would you like me to pass this?" or "Is it okay to use my hands?"). 3) When in doubt, choose conservative, neutral behaviour: use utensils if available, accept food graciously, and avoid dramatic gestures.ঘ Answer: "Thank you very much for your hospitality and the wonderful meal — I enjoyed it."

Explanation:
Dining etiquette conveys cultural meaning; being aware reduces the risk of unintended offense and deepens cross-cultural respect. The four examples show concrete differences in table rules and why they matter. The three strategies (observe, ask courteously, default to neutral behaviour) are practical in real-time situations. The gratitude phrase is simple, sincere, and unlikely to clash with specific cultural norms.

ক. ঋতুভিত্তিক শ্রম-অভিবাসন কী? সংক্ষিপ্ত সংজ্ঞা দিন।
খ. এ ধরনের অভিবাসনের প্রধান কারণগুলো কী কী?
গ. গ্রামে থাকা পরিবারগুলোর ওপর এর প্রভাব কীভাবে পড়ে?
ঘ. স্থায়ী উন্নতি ও মানবিক সুরক্ষার জন্য কী নীতিগত পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া উচিত?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক ঋতুভিত্তিক শ্রম-অভিবাসন হল এমন একটি চলমান人口চলন যেখানে ব্যক্তিরা বা পরিবারের সদস্যরা নির্দিষ্ট ঋতু বা মৌসুমিক চাহিদা মেটাতে স্বল্পকালীনভাবে তাদের নিবাস-স্থান ছেড়ে অন্য এলাকায় শ্রমের জন্য যাত্রা করে; কাজের মেয়াদ শেষ হলে তাঁরা সাধারণত বাড়িতে ফিরে যান।

খ প্রধান কারণগুলো: (১) মৌসুমী কৃষিকাজ বা ফসলের সময় এলাকায় অতিরিক্ত শ্রমের চাহিদা; (২) গ্রামীণ এলাকায় স্থায়ী কর্মসংস্থানের অভাব ও নিম্ন আয়; (৩) স্বল্পকালীন সুদক্ষ কাজ ও উচ্চ উপার্জনের প্রণোদনা; (৪) প্রথাগত নেটওয়ার্ক ও পুনরাবৃত্ত সামাজি-অর্থনৈতিক সম্পর্ক যা মানুষকে একই সময়ে চলতে উৎসাহিত করে; (৫) মৌসুমি দুর্যোগ বা ফসল-ব্যর্থতার কারণে অস্থায়ী উপার্জনের প্রয়োজন।

গ প্রভাব: পরিবারে আয় বাড়লে স্বল্পকালীন ভোগের উন্নতি—খাদ্য, শিক্ষা ও ঋণ পরিশোধে সহায়তা; কিন্তু শিশুর দেখভাল ও শিক্ষা বিঘ্নিত হতে পারে; পরিবারে মহিলা-শিশুদের উপর বাড়তি দায়িত্ব পড়ে; সামাজিক বিচ্ছিন্নতা ও মানসিক উদ্বেগ তৈরি হতে পারে; গ্রামের মানবসম্পদ অস্থায়ীভাবে সংকুচিত হয়।

ঘ নীতিগত পদক্ষেপ: মৌসুমি শ্রমের জন্য শ্রম-পরিচয় ও সুরক্ষা আইন, ফেয়ার-ওয়েজ নিশ্চিতকরণ; মৌসুমী শ্রমিকদের জন্য স্বাস্থ্যভাতা ও সামাজিক সুরক্ষা; স্থানীয় কর্মসৃজন উদ্যোগ ও ক্ষুদ্রকৃষি সহায়তা বাড়ানো; শিশুশিক্ষা ও প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক শিশু-দিবাস কেন্দ্র স্থাপন; শ্রমিকদের রেজিস্ট্রেশন ও দক্ষতা উন্নয়ন প্রশিক্ষণ।

Explanation:
সমাধানে ঋতুভিত্তিক শ্রম-অভিবাসনকে সংজ্ঞায়িত করে তার কারণ, প্রভাব ও নীতিগত উত্তরের প্রবাহ দেখানো হয়েছে। কারণগুলোর মধ্যে অর্থনৈতিক কারণ প্রধান, তবে সামাজিক-প্রথাগত নেটওয়ার্কও ভূমিকা রাখে। গ্রামীণ পরিবারের উপর ইতিবাচক আর্থিক প্রভাবের পাশাপাশি শিক্ষা ও পরিচর্যায় নেতিবাচক প্রভাবগুলিও তুলে ধরা হয়েছে। নীতিগুলো বাস্তবসম্মত: শ্রম সুরক্ষা, সামাজিক নিরাপত্তা, দক্ষতা উন্নয়ন ও স্থানীয় কর্মসংস্থান বৃদ্ধির ওপর জোর দেওয়া হয়েছে যাতে মৌসুমি শ্রমিকদের জীবনমান স্থায়ীভাবে উন্নত করা যায়।

ক. ব্রেইন-ড্রেন (মনঃপট দুর্গমন) কী? সংজ্ঞা এবং বৈশিষ্ট্য দাও।
খ. এই ধরনের পেশাজীবী অভিবাসনের মূল কারণগুলো কী কী?
গ. প্রেরণাদায়ী দেশের অর্থনীতি ও সমাজে এর সংক্ষিপ্ত ও দীর্ঘমেয়াদী প্রভাব কী হবে?
ঘ. এখনই গ্রহণযোগ্য ৫টি অনুকূল নীতি বা পদক্ষেপ উল্লেখ করো যা ব্রেইন-ড্রেন কমাতে সাহায্য করবে।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক ব্রেইন-ড্রেন বলতে বোঝায় উচ্চশিক্ষিত ও দক্ষ পেশাজীবীদের (যেমন ডাক্তার, প্রকৌশলী, বিজ্ঞানী) দেশের বাইরে অভিবাসন, যেখানে প্রেরণাদায়ী দেশ তাদের মানবসম্পদের মূল্যবান অংশ হারায়। বৈশিষ্ট্যের মধ্যে থাকে উচ্চশিক্ষিত ব্যক্তিদের অনুপাতে স্বল্পতা, বিনিয়োগকৃত শিক্ষা-সম্পদের ক্ষতি এবং প্রায়শই চিরস্থায়ী বা স্থায়ী প্রস্থান।

খ মূল কারণ: (১) ভালো বেতন ও কর্মপরিবেশের আকর্ষণ; (২) গবেষণা ও ক্যারিয়ার সুযোগের অভাব; (৩) রাজনৈতিক অস্থিতিশীলতা ও দুর্নীতি; (৪) শিক্ষা ও পেশাগত মূল্যায়নে স্বীকৃতির অভাব; (৫) নিরাপত্তা ও জীবনযাত্রার প্রত্যাশা।

গ প্রভাব: সংক্ষিপ্ত মেয়াদে মানবসম্পদ ঘাটতি দেখা দেয়—স্বাস্থ্যসেবা ও প্রযুক্তি সেবায় অবনতি; দীর্ঘমেয়াদে জাতীয় উদ্ভাবনশীলতা ও অর্থনৈতিক বিকাশে ধীরগতি; শিক্ষা বিনিয়োগের ফলাফল বিদেশে প্রবাহিত হওয়া; বিকল্পভাবে রেমিট্যান্স বাড়লে মাইক্রো-অর্থনৈতিক সুবিধা পাওয়া যায় কিন্তু উন্নয়নের টেকসইতা ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হতে পারে।

ঘ ৫টি নীতি: (১) প্রতিযোগিতামূলক বেতন ও কর্মশর্ত উন্নত করা; (২) গবেষণা ও উন্নয়নে স্থায়ী তহবিল বৃদ্ধি এবং ওয়ার্কিং ইনফ্রাস্ট্রাকচার; (৩) দক্ষতাভিত্তিক ক্যারিয়ার ট্র্যাক ও দ্রুত উন্নয়নের সুযোগ; (৪) রিটার্ন-স্কিম—বাসিন্দাদের ফেরত আনা ও পুনর্বাসন সুবিধা; (৫) আন্তর্জাতিক চুক্তি ও দ্বিপাক্ষিক কর্মী-পরিবহন নীতিতে অংশগ্রহণ করে দক্ষদের অস্থায়ীভাবে বিনিময় বৃদ্ধি।

Explanation:
উত্তরগুলো ব্রেইন-ড্রেনের সংজ্ঞা, কারণ ও প্রভাব স্পষ্ট করে। নীতিগত উত্তরে অর্থনৈতিক উদ্যোগ (বেতন, গবেষণা তহবিল) এবং অনুশাসনগত উদ্যোগ (ক্যারিয়ার ট্র্যাক, রিটার্ন-স্কিম) দুটোই মিলিয়ে দেয়া হয়েছে, কারণ শুধু অর্থনৈতিক প্রণোদনা নয়, পেশাগত সন্তুষ্টি ও নিরাপত্তাও ফেরত আনতে সমানভাবে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। রেমিট্যান্স ও আন্তর্জাতিক সহযোগিতার দিকটিও সামগ্রিক প্রেক্ষাপটে বিবেচিত হয়েছে।

ক আবহাওয়াগত-অভিবাসী বা climate refugee বলতে বোঝায় সেই ব্যক্তি বা গোষ্ঠীকে যারা পরিবেশগত পরিবর্তন—সমুদ্রপৃষ্ঠের উচ্চতা, মরুভূত্রীয়রণ, বন্যা, দীর্ঘমেয়াদি খরা ইত্যাদির কারণে তাদের নিবাস-স্থান ছেড়ে যেতে বাধ্য হয়। বৈধতা নিয়ে বিতর্ক আছে কারণ আন্তর্জাতিক অভিবাসন আইন (উদাহরণ: 1951 কনভেনশন) প্রথাগতভাবে রাজনৈতিক উৎখাত বা যুদ্ধের শিকারকে নিয়ে আলোচনা করে; পরিবেশ-ভিত্তিক বৈশিষ্ট্য এখনও বৈশ্বিক আইনগত স্বীকৃতিতে সীমিত।

খ পরিবেশগত কারণ: সমুদ্রপৃষ্ঠ বৃদ্ধির ফলে দ্বীপ-অধিকার হওয়া, ক্রমবর্ধমান ঘূর্ণিঝড় ও কীটনাশক ক্ষতি, দীর্ঘমেয়াদি খরা যা কৃষি ধ্বংস করে, মাটি ক্ষয় ও লবণাক্তকরণ যা মিষ্টজল অনুপলব্ধ করে—উদাহরণ: মালদ্বীপে সমুদ্রপৃষ্ঠ বৃদ্ধি; সাব-সাহারান আফ্রিকার শুকনো অঞ্চলে খরার কারণে কৃষক সমস্যা।

গ ইতিহাসে উল্লেখযোগ্য বাস্তুচ্যুতি: (১) ইংরেজি-আইরিশ বিষয়ক প্রাসঙ্গিকতা হিসেবে 19শ শতকের আইরিশ আলুগুল্ম দুর্ভিক্ষ—অর্ধমিলিয়ন মানুষ মৃত ও লাখ লাখ বাস্তুচ্যুত; (২) দ্বিতীয় বিশ্বযুদ্ধের সময় ইউরোপীয় লোকদের ব্যাপক বাস্তুচ্যুতি; (৩) সমসাময়িক সময়ে সিরিয়ার নাগরিক যুদ্ধে লক্ষ লক্ষ শরণার্থী—এগুলো রাজনৈতিক/প্রাকৃতিক ও মানবসৃষ্ট বিভিন্ন কারণে বড় বাস্তুচ্যুতির উদাহরণ।

ঘ কার্যকর উদ্যোগ: স্থানান্তরের পূর্ব পরিকল্পনা ও স্থানীয় পুনর্বাসন নকশা; ক্ষতিপূরণ ও অবকাঠামোগত বিনিয়োগ (উচ্চতর বাঁধ, জলনির্বাহী ব্যবস্থা); আন্তর্জাতিক তহবিল ও গ্রীন ক্লাইমেট ফান্ডের ব্যবহার; বৈশ্বিক স্বীকৃতি ও সুরক্ষার জন্য আইনি কাঠামো উন্নয়ন (climate-displacement accords); স্থানীয় দক্ষতা বিকাস ও নতুন জীবিকা-সৃষ্টি প্রোগ্রাম।

Explanation:
এই সমাধান আবহাওয়া-ভিত্তিক বাস্তুচ্যুতি সংজ্ঞায়িত করে এর আইনি জটিলতা তুলে ধরে, পরিবেশগত চালিকা শক্তিগুলো ও ইতিহাসের বড় বাস্তুচ্যুতির উদাহরণ দিয়েছে যাতে পাঠক পরিস্থিতির তীব্রতা বুঝতে পারে। প্রস্তাবিত উদ্যোগগুলো প্রকল্পগত এবং নীতি-ভিত্তিক—স্থানীয় অভিযোজন, অবকাঠামো, আন্তর্জাতিক তহবিল ও আইনি সুরক্ষা—এই চারটি স্তরে সমস্যা সমাধান অনুশীলনযোগ্য করা যায়।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
কপ্রিয় রাফি,

আশা করি তুমি ভালো আছো। গত কয়েক সপ্তাহে তোমার থেকে যে কয়েকটি ভয়াবহ ভয়েস নোট ও ফরোয়ার্ড পেয়েছি, সেগুলো পড়ে আমি অনেকবার চিন্তিত হয়েছি। তোমার উদ্দেশ্য নিশ্চয়ই আমাদের সবাইকে সতর্ক করা, কিন্তু অনির্বচনীয় বা উত্সহীন খবর শেয়ার করলে লোকজন অপ্রয়োজনীয় ভয় বা ভুল ধারণার শিকার হতে পারে। দয়া করে, কোনো খবর ফরোয়ার্ড করার আগে একটু থামো এবং যাচাই করে নাও। যদি তুমি চাও, আমি তোমার জন্য তা যাচাই করে দেবো বা আমরা একসঙ্গে দেখে নেবো। আমার কথা টেনে নিচ্ছি কারণ আমি তোমার মঙ্গল চাই—না কেবল তোমার, বরং আমাদের সবারও।

শুভেচ্ছা ও ভালবাসা,
তোমার বন্ধু — সাবা

খখবর/ফরোয়ার্ড যাচাই করার ৪টি সহজ ধাপ:
1) উৎস দেখো: যার থেকে এসেছে, সেটি কি বিশ্বস্ত সংবাদমাধ্যম বা পরিচিত প্রতিষ্ঠান? অননামিক গ্রুপ/চ্যানেল থেকে আসে কি না তা লক্ষ করো।
2) একাধিক সূত্র যাচাই করো: একই খবর অন্য কয়েকটি প্রধান সংবাদমাধ্যমে প্রকাশ হচ্ছে কি না দেখে নাও।
3) তত্ত্বগত চেক করো: কোনো চিত্র বা ভয়েস কটা বছরের পুরনো নয় তো? রিভার্স ইমেজ সার্চ বা ভয়েস-ফাইন্ডিং (যদি সম্ভব) ব্যবহার করো।
4) অফিসিয়াল বিবৃতি খোঁজো: পুলিশ, হাসপাতাল, পৌরসভা বা সংশ্লিষ্ট কর্তৃপক্ষের ওয়েবসাইট/সামাজিক মাধ্যম পেজে কথা আছে কি না দেখো।

গবারবার ভুয়া ফরোয়ার্ড করলে যে ক্ষতিসমূহ হতে পারে:
1) বিশ্বাসযোগ্যতার হ্রাস: বন্ধুবান্ধব ও পরিবারের কাছে তোমার কথার বিশ্বাস কমে যাবে; মানুষ তোমার জানিয়েছি কি না আগে আর দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি নিয়ে শঙ্কা করবে।
2) সামাজিক বিভ্রাট: ভুয়া সংবাদ কখনো কখনো গোষ্ঠী সংঘাত, গুজব-ভিত্তিক ভুল ধারণা বা অপ্রয়োজনীয় আতঙ্কমূলক পরিস্থিতি সৃষ্টি করতে পারে—যার ফলে সম্পর্ক নষ্ট হয়ে যেতে পারে।
3) আইনগত ও পেশাগত ঝুঁকি: কিছু দেশে ডিজিটাল সিকিউরিটি বা সাইবার আইনের আওতায় মিথ্যা তথ্য ছড়ানোর ফলে আইনি জটিলতা বা জরিমানা/শাস্তির সম্ভাবনা থাকে; পেশাগত জীবনেও নেতিবাচক প্রভাব পড়তে পারে।

ঘসংক্ষিপ্ত সতর্কবার্তা:
"একবার শেয়ার করার আগে থামো — সত্য যাচাই করো; মিথ্যে ছড়ালে ক্ষতি হয়, সঠিক তথ্য ছড়ালে সেবাও হয়।"

Explanation:
চিঠিটি নম্র ও ব্যক্তিগত রাখতে বলা হয়েছে যাতে টার্গেট ব্যক্তি প্রতিরক্ষামূলক হয়ে না পড়ে। যাচাই ধাপগুলো সরল ও ব্যবহারযোগ্য—উৎস, বহুতলা উৎস যাচাই, কনটেন্টের তারিখ/প্রাসঙ্গিকতা দেখার পরামর্শ এবং অফিসিয়াল সূত্র খোঁজার ওপর জোর দেয়। ক্ষতিসমূহ সামাজিক বিশ্বাস, সম্পর্ক এবং আইনগত/পেশাগত ঝুঁকি হিসেবে উপস্থাপিত করা হয়েছে যাতে প্রভাব স্পষ্ট বোঝানো যায়। সতর্কবার্তাটি সংক্ষিপ্ত, স্মরণীয় ও কার্যকরী রাখার চেষ্টা করা হয়েছে।

Question:
Write a paragraph on ‘Contamination of Drinking Water in Urban Areas’ in about 200 words based on the following points.

Options:
ক. What is meant by drinking water contamination?
খ. How does drinking water get contaminated in cities?
গ. Why does this contamination happen?
ঘ. Who is responsible and should the problem be solved immediately?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Drinking water contamination means the presence of physical, chemical, biological or radiological substances in water at levels that make it unsafe for human consumption. Contaminants include microbes (bacteria, viruses, protozoa), chemical pollutants (heavy metals, nitrates, industrial solvents), and physical impurities (silt, plastic particles). Safe drinking water should be free from such harmful agents.খ In cities contamination occurs through leaky or poorly maintained distribution pipes, illegal connections, cross-contamination between sewage and water mains, runoff from construction and roads, industrial discharges into rivers used as water sources, and inadequate treatment at water plants. Storage in dirty tanks and illegal tanker refills further introduce pollutants.গ Contamination happens because of aging infrastructure, rapid urbanization that outpaces service upgrades, weak enforcement of environmental and industrial regulations, insufficient wastewater treatment, and limited budgets for water utilities. Human behavior—improper disposal of waste, informal housing without sanitation—also contributes.ঘ Responsibility is shared: municipal water authorities, urban planners, industries discharging effluents, and citizens all play roles. The problem must be addressed immediately because contaminated drinking water causes outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases, long-term chronic illnesses from chemicals, and undermines public trust. Solutions include infrastructure repair, strict pollution controls, regular monitoring, affordable treatment technologies, public education, and clear legal accountability.

Explanation:
This solution groups the issue into definition, pathways, root causes, and responsibility. Defining contamination clarifies what makes water unsafe. Pathways highlight common urban mechanisms: failing pipes, sewage leaks, industrial discharge, and storage failures. Causes emphasize systemic issues (infrastructure, regulation, finance) and human practices. Assigning shared responsibility recognizes that utilities must invest in treatment and maintenance, industries must control effluents, and citizens must adopt safe storage and disposal habits. Immediate action is necessary because both acute (infection outbreaks) and chronic (metal toxicity, carcinogens) health effects arise from contaminated water. Practical control measures include routine water quality testing, repairing distribution networks to prevent ingress, upgrading wastewater treatment plants, enforcing discharge standards, subsidizing small-scale point-of-use filters for vulnerable households, and transparent reporting so communities can demand accountability.

Question:
Compose a paragraph on ‘Pesticide Residues on Fruits and Vegetables’ in about 200 words using the prompts below.

Options:
ক. What are pesticide residues and why do they matter?
খ. How do residues remain on or in produce?
গ. Why are excessive pesticides used on crops?
ঘ. Who should act to reduce residues and what measures are effective?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Pesticide residues are small amounts of chemical pesticides that persist on or inside fruits and vegetables after application. They matter because some residues can be toxic to humans—causing acute poisoning, hormonal disruption, or long-term effects like cancer—especially for vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women. Regulatory limits (MRLs) exist to protect consumers.খ Residues remain due to the timing and method of spraying, the chemical persistence of the active ingredient, and inadequate pre-harvest intervals (time between last spray and harvest). Systemic pesticides can be absorbed into plant tissues, making surface washing less effective. Post-harvest practices, like using treated water or contaminated storage, can also add residues.গ Farmers may overuse pesticides to control pests rapidly, secure higher yields, meet market expectations for blemish-free produce, compensate for lack of integrated pest management knowledge, or when pesticides are cheap and readily available without proper regulation. Pest resistance can also lead to higher doses and more frequent applications.ঘ Responsibility lies with farmers, agricultural extension services, agrochemical suppliers, regulators, and consumers. Effective measures include training in integrated pest management (IPM), enforcing maximum residue limits and safe use regulations, promoting biopesticides and cultural controls, establishing residue monitoring at markets, and educating consumers on washing, peeling, and purchasing from trusted sources. Coordinated action reduces health risks while sustaining crop productivity.

Explanation:
The answer explains what residues are and links them to health risks, which justifies regulation like MRLs. It distinguishes surface versus systemic pesticides, clarifying why some residues resist simple washing. Reasons for overuse are economic and knowledge-based—lack of training, market pressure, easy availability—which points to targeted fixes such as IPM training and stricter sales controls. The shared-responsibility approach recognizes the roles of regulators (setting and enforcing limits), extension services (education), farmers (practices), suppliers (responsible sales), and consumers (informed choices). Practical measures—monitoring, alternatives to chemical pesticides, and consumer guidance—are actionable steps to reduce residues without harming food security.

Question:
Prepare a paragraph on ‘Unsafe Food Preservation Practices in Small Shops and Homes’ in about 200 words guided by the questions below.

Options:
ক. What are unsafe food preservation practices?
খ. How do such practices make food hazardous?
গ. Why do people adopt unsafe preservation methods?
ঘ. Who must intervene and which control strategies work best?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Unsafe food preservation practices include using unapproved chemical preservatives, excessive salting or sugaring without hygiene, storing perishable foods at improper temperatures, reusing contaminated oil, and smoking or drying foods in polluted environments. These methods aim to extend shelf life but can compromise safety and quality when done incorrectly.খ Such practices make food hazardous by enabling microbial growth (if temperatures are wrong), concentrating harmful substances (excessive salt, sugar, or illegal additives), forming toxic breakdown products (repeatedly heated oil produces carcinogens), or adding toxic chemicals that cause acute or chronic poisoning. Cross-contamination from dirty storage or equipment further increases risk.গ People adopt unsafe methods due to lack of knowledge, the need to reduce waste and losses, cost constraints that limit refrigeration, pressure to keep produce longer for sale, and limited access to safe preservation technologies. Traditional methods without adequate hygiene also persist for cultural or economic reasons.ঘ Intervention is needed from food safety authorities, local governments, shop owners, and households. Effective controls include affordable cold-chain solutions, training on hygienic preservation, subsidized access to safe packaging and preservatives approved by regulators, routine inspection of retail shops, public awareness campaigns, and incentives for adopting safer technologies. Combining regulation with practical support helps phase out risky practices while preserving livelihoods.

Explanation:
This response clarifies what constitutes unsafe preservation and links specific practices to health hazards—microbial, chemical, and physical. Understanding drivers (economic pressures, lack of technology, traditional habits) helps tailor interventions: simply banning practices without offering alternatives will fail. Therefore, solutions combine enforcement (inspections, approved preservative lists) with enabling measures (training, affordable refrigeration, safe oils, better packaging). Highlighting shared responsibility emphasizes that authorities must regulate and support, sellers must adopt safer methods, and consumers should demand safer food. Such a balanced approach protects public health while considering economic realities of small shops and households.

Options:
ক. What is ambition?
খ. What are the key characteristics of ambition?
গ. Why is ambition especially important for someone in a creative field like music?
ঘ. Do you have an ambition? Describe one concrete step you will take to achieve it.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Ambition is an inner drive or goal-oriented desire to achieve something meaningful; for a musician it might be to create a distinctive sound, perform on a major stage, or teach and inspire others. খ Key characteristics of ambition include clarity of purpose, persistence, willingness to learn from failure, long-term commitment, and the ability to translate abstract goals into actionable plans (practice routines, networking, portfolio building). গ In creative fields ambition provides direction in a realm where talent alone is not enough: it motivates discipline in practice, encourages risk-taking in composition or performance, and helps artists push beyond comfort zones to develop a unique voice that audiences can connect with. ঘ Personal example: my ambition is to release a full-length album that blends traditional motifs with modern production. One concrete step I will take is to set a weekly schedule: three focused composition sessions and two review sessions with collaborators each week, plus a target to complete one finished track every six weeks.

Explanation:
This solution breaks the idea of ambition into definition, traits, relevance, and a practical personal plan. Definition establishes scope; traits translate the abstract notion into observable behaviors (clarity, persistence, planning). The relevance section ties ambition to creativity by showing how it turns inconsistent inspiration into sustained output and growth. The final part models a SMART-like approach (specific, measurable, time-bound) by converting a broad dream—an album—into weekly routines and an intermediate milestone (one finished track every six weeks). This demonstrates how ambition works in everyday practice and why it matters for artistic progress.

Question:
A sleep researcher drafts a short public note about dreams for a general audience. The note should clarify what dreams are from a scientific viewpoint and offer a practical takeaway. Use the prompts below to structure the explanation.

Options:
ক. What is a dream from a neuroscience perspective?
খ. What typical features distinguish dreams from waking thoughts?
গ. What are the main scientific theories about why we dream?
ঘ. How can someone keep a useful record of their dreams to study patterns?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক From a neuroscience perspective, a dream is a subjective experience generated by coordinated brain activity during sleep—most often during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep—characterized by vivid imagery, emotions, and narrative-like sequences that arise without direct external sensory input. খ Typical features that distinguish dreams include heightened emotional intensity, sensory vividness (visual and auditory imagery), altered logic or temporality (events can shift abruptly), and reduced critical self-reflection compared with waking thought. Dreams also often incorporate fragments of recent memories. গ Main scientific theories include: (1) memory consolidation—dreaming helps process and integrate memories; (2) emotional regulation—dreams allow rehearsal and processing of emotional experiences; (3) activation-synthesis—dreams result from the brain making sense of spontaneous neural activity; and (4) synaptic homeostasis—sleep and dreaming help renormalize synaptic strength. These theories are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. ঘ To keep a useful dream record, keep a notebook and pen by the bed and write down any recalled images or feelings immediately upon waking (even keywords help). Note date, sleep duration, emotional tone, and any recurring themes. Over weeks, look for patterns (people, places, anxieties) that may relate to waking life or sleep quality.

Explanation:
The explanation connects empirical observations with theory. Part ক defines dreams in terms familiar to neuroscience (REM, internally generated experience). Part খ contrasts dream phenomenology with waking thought, highlighting emotional vividness and altered logic—useful for readers to recognize dream states. Part গ summarizes major scientific hypotheses, emphasizing that no single theory fully explains dreaming; instead, different models address memory, emotion, and neural dynamics. Part ঘ gives an actionable, low-effort method (dream journaling) that both laypeople and researchers can use to collect qualitative data: immediate recording reduces forgetting, and tracking metadata (date, sleep length, mood) allows correlation with stress, life events, or interventions like changes in sleep schedule.

Question:
A travel writer uses the idea of 'dream journeys' as a metaphor for personal goals. Using the prompts, craft a clear, reflective piece that defines the metaphor and offers practical guidance for readers who want to turn a dream journey into reality.

Options:
ক. What does the metaphor 'dream journey' mean in this context?
খ. What are the common phases someone goes through on a dream journey?
গ. What obstacles typically derail such journeys, and how can they be managed?
ঘ. Suggest one realistic mini-plan a reader could follow to begin their own 'dream journey'.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক In this context, the 'dream journey' metaphor describes the process of pursuing a meaningful personal goal—such as traveling, changing careers, or launching a creative project—framed as a voyage from an imagined destination toward concrete achievement. খ Common phases include: initial inspiration (envisioning the dream), planning and preparation (research, skill-building, saving), active pursuit (taking steps, facing tests), and adaptation or arrival (adjusting course, celebrating milestones, or redefining the goal). গ Typical obstacles are unclear goals, fear of failure, resource constraints (time, money), and loss of momentum. These can be managed by setting specific, measurable sub-goals, establishing accountability (partners or mentors), creating contingency plans for resources, and maintaining routine habits that produce steady progress. ঘ A realistic mini-plan: if your dream is to write a travel guide, start with a 12-week plan—weeks 1–2: choose a region and outline chapters; weeks 3–8: research and write one chapter draft per week; weeks 9–10: peer review and revise; weeks 11–12: prepare a sample for pitching or self-publishing. Commit fixed weekly hours and a short checklist to keep momentum.

Explanation:
This response uses the journey metaphor to structure actionable advice. Part ক frames the metaphor so readers understand it is practical, not purely poetic. Part খ breaks the process into phases that map to planning and execution frameworks used in project management, making the intangible feel manageable. Part গ lists common derailers and pairs each with a mitigation strategy (SMART sub-goals, accountability, contingency planning, routine formation). Part ঘ provides a concrete, time-boxed mini-plan demonstrating how to translate aspiration into a series of achievable steps; the 12-week structure offers clear checkpoints and reduces overwhelm by focusing on one chapter or task at a time.

Question:
You are Riya. Your classmate Samir stammers and avoids speaking English in class. He has asked you for help. Prepare responses that will guide and encourage him to practice spoken English confidently.

Options:
ক. Samir-কে একটি ব্যক্তিগত চিঠি লিখুন যেখানে তাকে সাহস জোগান ও স্পোকেন ইংরেজি অনুশীলনের পরামর্শ দিন।
খ. দৈনন্দিন জীবনে ইংরেজি অনুশীলনের পাঁচটি বাস্তবিক উপায় লিখুন এবং প্রতিটির জন্য সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা দিন।

ঘ. ভাষা আত্মবিশ্বাস বাড়ানোর উপর 6-8 লাইনের একটি অনুচ্ছেদ লিখুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক
Dear Samir,

I hope you are well. I know you feel nervous about speaking English in class, and I want to tell you that many students feel the same. First, please don’t be hard on yourself — mistakes are part of learning. Start with small steps: speak a few simple sentences each day, even if it is just greeting someone in English. Practice with me or another friend in a calm place so you can build confidence without pressure. Try short daily activities like reading one paragraph aloud, repeating short dialogues from a book, and recording your voice to notice progress. Focus on communicating ideas rather than perfection — fluency comes with practice. If you forget a word, describe it in simple words rather than staying silent. Join a small speaking group or an English club at school where everyone supports each other. Be patient, practice regularly, and celebrate small improvements. I believe you can become a confident speaker.

Yours,
Riya

খ
1) Speak with a friend for 10 minutes daily: Casual conversation reduces fear because it’s low-stakes and repetitive practice improves fluency.

2) Shadowing short audio clips: Listen to a native speaker sentence and immediately repeat it. This improves pronunciation and rhythm.

3) Describe daily activities aloud in English (self-talk): Narrating tasks trains sentence formation and reduces hesitation.

4) Use a simple phrasebook or word list and try to use three new words daily: Expands active vocabulary so Samir can express more ideas.

5) Record short voice notes and replay them: Hearing oneself helps identify problems and track improvement without judgement.

গ
Daily Speaking Routine (10 steps, short lines):
1. Warm-up: Say hello and introduce yourself aloud (1 minute).
2. Pronunciation drill: Repeat 5 common words slowly (2 minutes).
3. Shadowing: Listen to a 30-second clip and repeat (3 minutes).
4. Self-talk: Describe one task you did today in 2–3 sentences (2 minutes).
5. Question practice: Ask and answer one simple question like "What did you eat?" (1 minute).
6. New words: Use three new words in sentences (2 minutes).
7. Role-play: Practice a short dialogue (2 minutes).
8. Record: Record 30 seconds of speech (1 minute).
9. Playback: Listen and note one thing to improve (2 minutes).
10. Positive note: Say one line praising your effort (30 seconds).
(Adjust times; total routine ≈15 minutes.)

ঘ
Confidence is the bridge between knowledge and communication. When learners focus on expressing ideas rather than fearing mistakes, they begin to speak more freely. Small, regular successes — such as completing a short conversation or using a new word — build self-trust. Supportive practice environments, like friendly study groups or patient partners, reduce anxiety and provide constructive feedback. Over time, repeated practice reshapes the speaker’s expectations: errors become signs of learning, not reasons for shame. With patience and consistent effort, confidence grows naturally and speaking becomes enjoyable.

Explanation:
The solution gives Samir a supportive, step-by-step plan: a friendly letter to motivate, five practical daily activities to build skills, a concrete short routine he can follow immediately, and an explanation of how confidence develops. Each suggestion focuses on frequent low-pressure practice, active vocabulary use, pronunciation work, and self-monitoring — evidence-based methods for improving spoken language. The routine is short so it is sustainable; recording and playback are included because they allow self-assessment without public exposure. Emphasis throughout is on gradual progress and shifting mindset from fear of mistakes to learning through mistakes.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক
Dear Joya,

I know you are nervous, but a focused 7-day plan will help. Follow this schedule:
Day 1: Review basic sentence structure (subject-verb-object) and write 5 simple sentences.
Day 2: Practice tenses — present simple and past simple. Write short paragraphs using each tense.
Day 3: Work on linking words and paragraph structure (topic sentence, supporting sentences, conclusion). Write two short paragraphs.
Day 4: Vocabulary building — learn 10 exam-useful words and practice using them in sentences.
Day 5: Practice one full writing task (40–50 words or 80–100 words depending on exam), then self-check.
Day 6: Revise grammar errors found earlier; practice punctuation and capitalization rules.
Day 7: Mock test — write within time limit, then proofread using the checklist.

Best wishes,
Tanvir

খ
1) Subject–verb agreement: Ensure the verb matches the subject in number.
Example: "He writes a letter." (not "He write a letter.")

2) Correct tense usage: Maintain consistent tense in a paragraph; use past for past events.
Example: "I visited the museum yesterday and learned a lot." (past tense throughout)

3) Use of articles (a, an, the): Use 'a/an' for general items and 'the' for specific items.
Example: "I saw a dog. The dog was black." 

4) Linkers and cohesion: Use connectors to join ideas (however, moreover, therefore, because).
Example: "I studied hard; therefore, I passed the test."

5) Sentence variety and punctuation: Mix simple and complex sentences; use commas and periods correctly.
Example: "Although it rained, we went out, and we enjoyed the day."

A Memorable Day

Last spring, I had a memorable day when my school organized a cultural program. I felt excited from the morning because I was selected to recite a poem. My parents came to watch, and my friends praised me before the show. During the program, I took a deep breath and began my recitation slowly. As I continued, my confidence grew, and by the last line the audience clapped warmly. After the program, several teachers complimented me and I felt proud. That day taught me that practice helps overcome fear and that small achievements bring lasting joy.

ঘ
Pre-exam and post-exam checklist tips:
1) Before writing, read the question carefully and underline key words.
2) Plan: Spend 3–5 minutes jotting a quick outline (intro, 2–3 points, conclusion).
3) Write clearly and check paragraph structure — one idea per paragraph.
4) After writing, proofread for tense consistency, subject–verb agreement, and punctuation.
5) If time allows, replace weak words with stronger vocabulary and check spelling.



Explanation:
The solution supplies a realistic 7-day study plan that balances grammar review, vocabulary, and timed practice. The five grammar strategies are common exam pitfalls with clear examples to help Joya avoid mistakes. The model paragraph "A Memorable Day" is exam-appropriate: clear topic sentence, chronological events, personal reaction, and a concluding moral — a format graders often reward. The checklist focuses on time management, planning, and proofreading — practical skills that improve exam performance.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক
Dear Mina,

I understand you enjoy Bangla books, but reading English can open new stories, help your studies, and improve communication. Start small: choose short, illustrated stories with simple language. Read for 15 minutes a day, and don’t worry about understanding every word — guess meanings from pictures or context. Keep a small notebook to write down three new words with their Bengali meanings and one sentence each. Read aloud sometimes to improve pronunciation. Join me once a week and we will discuss what we read; talking about a story makes it more enjoyable. With gentle steps, English reading will become fun, not a burden.

Love,
Leila

খ
4-Week Reading Plan:
Week 1 (Foundations): 15 minutes daily — picture storybooks; focus on understanding the story and noting 3 new words.
Week 2 (Simple Sentences): 20 minutes daily — short graded readers (level 1); read aloud twice and write 2–3 sentence summary each day.
Week 3 (Short Chapters): 25 minutes daily — level 2 readers with short chapters; practice reading one chapter every 2–3 days and discuss main idea.
Week 4 (Reading & Response): 30 minutes daily — choose a single short book to finish; write a short review and share with a friend.

গ
1) "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" — Simple repetitive language and pictures make vocabulary memorable for beginners.

2) "First Thousand Words" (picture dictionary book) — Visual word associations help build a basic active vocabulary quickly.

3) "Oxford Bookworms Starter: The Elephant's Friend" — Graded text with manageable sentences and short chapters suitable for learners.

ঘ
Book Review: "The Friendly Fish"
"The Friendly Fish" is a short, colourful story about a little fish who helps others in the pond. The language is simple and the sentences are easy to follow, making it ideal for beginners. The pictures match the text closely and help readers understand new words. I enjoyed the message about kindness and teamwork. After reading, I learned words like 'shimmer', 'current' and 'rescued'. I would recommend this book to any new English reader because it is fun, short, and encouraging.



Explanation:
This solution combines gentle persuasion with a clear, achievable 4-week plan so Mina can build reading habits gradually. Recommended book choices are beginner-friendly: picture books and graded readers that increase in complexity. The reading activities (reading aloud, noting new words, summarizing) develop comprehension, pronunciation, and active vocabulary. The sample review demonstrates a simple structure Mina can copy: title, brief plot, language level, personal reaction, new words learned, and recommendation — a useful template for learner reviews.

Solution:
ক উত্তর: The remarkable learner is a dedicated student who combines enthusiasm for knowledge with kindness. They are regular in attendance, punctual, and show consistent interest in lessons. Teachers know them as attentive and curious, while classmates recognize them for fairness and willingness to help.

খ উত্তর: Their standout study habits include planning study time, reviewing notes after each class, and practising self-testing rather than rote memorization. They balance persistence with adaptability: when a method fails, they try new strategies. Personal qualities include discipline, patience, respect for others, honesty, and a growth mindset that treats mistakes as learning opportunities.

গ উত্তর: In class they contribute by asking thoughtful questions, sharing resources, and helping peers understand difficult topics without belittling anyone. In school life they join clubs, organize study groups, and take part in community service like tutoring younger students or participating in cleanliness and literacy drives. Their actions model civic-mindedness and encourage a cooperative atmosphere.

ঘ উত্তর: They are motivated by curiosity, a desire to improve, and the goal of serving others through their skills. Their advice to peers would be: set clear goals, make small daily steps, seek help when needed, and remember that consistent effort and kindness matter more than occasional brilliance. They emphasize balance—study hard, rest well, and help others along the way.

Explanation:
The profile emphasizes both academic habits and social character because a lasting role-model student combines competence with character. The answers highlight practical, evidence-based study techniques (planning, review, self-testing) and psychological traits (growth mindset, persistence). Contributions to class and community demonstrate leadership through service, which reinforces learning and social bonding. The motivation and advice section frames why these behaviors persist and offers actionable guidance peers can follow, making the profile useful for the bulletin's inspirational goal.

Options:
ক. How would you define a responsible learner in one sentence?
খ. Which moral qualities and daily routines should a responsible learner follow?
গ. What responsibilities toward classmates, teachers and school property should they observe?
ঘ. How does becoming a responsible learner benefit the individual and the school community?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: A responsible learner is someone who takes ownership of their education by being prepared, honest, respectful and proactive in both learning and school life.

খ উত্তর: Moral qualities include integrity, punctuality, empathy, and self-discipline. Daily routines that support responsibility are preparing lessons the night before, maintaining a tidy study area, setting short achievable goals each day, arriving on time, reviewing class notes, and getting adequate sleep. They also reflect on errors and ask for help when needed.

গ উত্তর: Toward classmates they are cooperative and supportive—sharing notes, listening during group work, and discouraging bullying. Toward teachers they show respect by following instructions, submitting assignments on time, and participating politely. Regarding school property, they conserve resources, keep classrooms clean, and treat books, equipment and school facilities with care.

ঘ উত্তর: For the individual, responsibility builds trust, improves academic outcomes, and fosters self-confidence and time-management skills. For the school community, responsible learners create a positive learning environment, reduce conflicts, and inspire others to act thoughtfully, raising overall morale and performance.

Explanation:
This leaflet-style paragraph defines responsibility concisely and then breaks it into traits and routines that are actionable. Emphasizing duties to peers, teachers and property clarifies social expectations and prevents vague advice. Describing benefits ties behavior to outcomes, making the guidance motivational: students see immediate personal gains and broader communal rewards, encouraging adoption of the suggested habits.

Question:
A magazine asks students to write a reflective paragraph titled "A Balanced Student: Mind, Heart, Body". The following prompts should shape your reflection on balance in academic life, emotions and health.

Options:
ক. What does being a balanced student mean?
খ. How do they divide time between study, creativity and rest?
গ. What emotional habits and social skills help maintain balance?
ঘ. Would you aim to be a balanced student? Explain how and why.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: Being a balanced student means nurturing intellectual growth, emotional well-being, and physical health simultaneously so that none of these areas is neglected at the expense of another.

খ উত্তর: They schedule study blocks interleaved with short creative breaks (for art, music or hobbies) and allocate time for daily physical activity and sufficient sleep. For example, a weekday plan might include focused studying in the morning, extracurricular practice or creative work in the late afternoon, light review in the evening, and a fixed bedtime to ensure rest. They use weekly planning rather than last-minute cramming to avoid burnout.

গ উত্তর: Emotional habits like self-awareness, regular reflection, and stress-management techniques (deep breathing, brief walks) help preserve balance. Social skills such as asking for support, setting healthy boundaries, and maintaining positive friendships prevent isolation and encourage collaborative learning. They celebrate small successes and accept setbacks calmly.

ঘ উত্তর: Yes—I would aim to be a balanced student because sustained learning depends on steady energy, creativity, and mental health. Practically, I would keep a weekly planner with priorities, set realistic study goals, allot time for exercise and hobbies, and check in weekly on emotional state to adjust routines. This approach promotes better long-term performance and a more enjoyable school experience.

Explanation:
Balance is framed as an active process—planning and habits—rather than a fixed trait. The answers combine time-management techniques (planning, interleaving work and breaks) with emotional strategies and social behaviors that support resilience. The personal commitment section models how one can implement balance, demonstrating that small consistent practices yield better outcomes than sporadic intense effort.

Dear [Cousin's Name],

Subject: How I Prepared for the HSC — A Practical Plan You Can Use

Hi [Name],

I hope you are well. With exams coming up, I wanted to share the exact way I prepared so you can adapt it. I planned my work week and stuck to it almost every day. Mornings were for difficult subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics) when my concentration was highest. Afternoons I revised theory-based subjects (History, Bengali, English) and evenings were reserved for past papers and short practice quizzes.

Resources I used included: the prescribed textbooks, at least ten years of past HSC papers, a reliable concise notes book I made myself, online lecture videos for topics I couldn’t grasp in class, and a small question bank for daily practice.

My mindset was: set realistic daily goals, accept small setbacks, and focus on consistent progress rather than perfection. I took short 5–10 minute breaks every 50 minutes, kept a weekly progress sheet, and asked teachers for clarification immediately when stuck.

If you want, I can send you my study notes and the weekly timetable I used. Stay consistent and keep me updated — we can revise together online.

Best wishes,
[Your Name]

খ
Weekly Timetable (Sample — adapt as needed):

Monday
- 06:00–07:30: Morning revision — Math problems
- 07:30–08:30: Breakfast/short walk
- 09:00–11:00: Physics (new topics)
- 11:15–12:30: Chemistry (theory + short notes)
- 13:30–15:00: Lunch/Rest
- 15:00–16:30: Bengali (essay/summary practice)
- 17:00–18:30: Past paper questions (mixed)
- 19:00–20:00: Light reading (English literature)
- 21:00: Reflection & plan next day

Tuesday — similar structure but swap subject focus: Chemistry intensive morning, Mathematics in afternoon, English practice evening.

Wednesday — Mock-timed test (2 hours) in the morning; afternoons for reviewing test mistakes; short hobby or exercise in evening.

Thursday — New topics in remaining subjects; group study/teacher doubt session after school; short past-paper session at night.

Friday — Consolidation day: revise all subjects briefly (30–45 minutes each), focus on weak spots.

Saturday — Long practice session (3–4 hours) doing full-length past paper under timed conditions; evening for relaxation and family time.

Sunday — Light revision: summaries, flashcards, and planning upcoming week; allow 2–3 hours for hobby/mental rest.

Notes: Schedule 50–60 minute focused blocks, 5–10 minute breaks, and a longer 30–60 minute break after 3–4 blocks.

গ
Five Study Techniques and Why They Worked:
1) Active recall: I closed notes and tried to write or state what I had learned. This strengthened long-term memory and revealed gaps.
2) Past-paper practice under timed conditions: This reduced exam anxiety and improved time management on actual papers.
3) Summary notes and one-page ‘cheat sheets’ for each topic: Forced me to identify key ideas and made last-minute revision fast and effective.
4) Teaching a peer or talking out loud: Explaining topics to someone else clarified my own understanding and made weak points obvious.
5) Spaced repetition: I revisited topics at increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week) which prevented forgetting and built stronger recall.

ঘ
A short encouraging paragraph to read before each session:

You’ve prepared steadily — one small step at a time. Focus on what you can control today: a clear goal, your best effort, and calm breathing. Mistakes are feedback, not failure. Keep moving forward; progress compounds.


Explanation:
The email (ক) is structured like a real message: greeting, subject, concrete actions, resources, mindset and offer of help. The weekly timetable (খ) presents a balanced routine with intensive study blocks, practice tests, and rest; it follows the 50–10 focused-block principle and alternates subject types to avoid fatigue. The five techniques (গ) are evidence-based study methods: active recall, timed past-papers, concise notes, peer teaching, and spaced repetition — all supported by cognitive learning research. The short paragraph (ঘ) is a motivational cue designed to reduce anxiety and set a specific, controllable intention before a study session, which improves concentration and resilience.

I am preparing for the upcoming entrance exam and I find myself struggling with a few specific topics in [Subject]: Topic A (conceptual connections), Topic B (problem-solving technique), and Topic C (application questions). Could I meet you for a 30–40 minute session sometime this week to go over these areas? If in-person is difficult, a short online meeting or a list of recommended practice problems would be extremely helpful.

I have attached my recent mock-test scores and a list of the exact subtopics I find confusing. I would be grateful for any focused exercises or pointers on how to approach these questions under time pressure.

Thank you for your time and guidance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Message to Study Partner:

Hey [Partner’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I propose we meet for a weekly study group to cover weak areas and do timed practice. Plan: two sessions per week (Mon evening: 2 hours — theory review and shared notes; Sat morning: 3 hours — timed past-paper + debrief). Each session we’ll pick 2 priority topics, exchange short summaries beforehand, and spend 30 minutes correcting and discussing mistakes. Let me know if this works and which times suit you.

Cheers,
[Your Name]

গ
7-Day Intensive Revision Schedule (Final Week)
Day 1 (Monday): Full-length mock test (timed). Evening: detailed review of mistakes and gap list.
Day 2 (Tuesday): Targeted work on weakest topic 1 (concept review, short exercises). Night: 30-minute light review of formulae/key points.
Day 3 (Wednesday): Targeted work on weakest topic 2 + 1-hour mixed-problem set.
Day 4 (Thursday): Quick recap of theory across all subjects (30–45 minutes each), practice short-answer questions.
Day 5 (Friday): Past-paper practice focusing on question types that cost most time; practice time allocation strategies.
Day 6 (Saturday): Group study/mock interview (if applicable) or peer-check session; review and finalise quick-reference sheets.
Day 7 (Sunday — exam eve): Low-intensity review: read summaries, polish mental preparation, light sleep hygiene routine. No heavy studying after early evening.

ঘ
Six On-the-Day Exam Strategies:
1) Arrive early, with all allowed stationery and ID ready.
2) Skim the entire paper in the first 10 minutes; mark easy questions to solve first.
3) Use time blocks on the question paper (e.g., allocate minutes per section/question and stick to it).
4) If stuck, leave the question and return later — avoid wasting time.
5) Show concise working; partial credit helps — write steps clearly.
6) Reserve last 10–15 minutes to re-check answers and correct sloppy mistakes.


Explanation:
The email (ক) is respectful and specific: it names topics, requests a short meeting, and offers to provide evidence (mock-test scores). This increases the likelihood of a focused response. The peer message (খ) proposes concrete meeting times and a clear agenda so collaboration is efficient. The 7-day plan (গ) follows the principle of testing early (mock on Day 1) and then targeted remediation; it balances practice, review, and rest before exam day. The on-the-day tips (ঘ) are practical tactics that improve time management, reduce careless errors, and maximise scoring opportunities.

Question:
While returning from school, a class five boy discovered a leather wallet lying under a bench in the park. Inside there were several notes, a driver's licence with the owner's name and address, and a small shopping list. The boy thought about taking the money because his family needed groceries, but he decided to act. He walked to the nearest community center for help.

ক. এই পরিস্থিতিতে ছেলেটির প্রথম করণীয় কী হওয়া উচিত?
খ. কমিউনিটি সেন্টারের কার কাছে বা কীভাবে তাকে হস্তান্তর করা উচিত?
গ. যদি মালিক শনাক্ত হয়, তাঁর সম্ভাব্য প্রতিক্রিয়া এবং কীভাবে ছেলেটিকে পুরস্কৃত বা ধন্যবাদ জানানো যেতে পারে?
ঘ. এই ঘটনাতে কী নৈতিক শিক্ষা নেওয়া যায় এবং ভবিষ্যতে একই সিদ্ধান্তের সুফল কী হতে পারে?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: ছেলেটির প্রথম করণীয় হওয়া উচিত নিরাপদভাবে ও শালীনভাবে প্যার্সটি ধরে রাখা এবং দ্রুতই নির্ভরযোগ্য প্রাপ্তিকে জানানো — যেমন স্কুলের শিক্ষক, কমিউনিটি সেন্টার অথবা নিকটস্থ পুলিশ স্টেশন। সে প্যার্সটি নিজের কাছে না রেখে অনেকে দেখার জায়গায় রেখে বা একজন বড় বা কর্মকর্তা কে দিলেই ঠিক। এটি মুদ্রা উধাও বা ভুল সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়া প্রতিরোধ করবে।

খ উত্তর: পার্সটি কমিউনিটি সেন্টারের রিসেপশনে বা দায়িত্বশিল্পী (যদি সেখানে নিরাপত্তা বা চেয়ারের দায়িত্বে কেউ থাকে) এবং পরে পুলিশে বা মালিককে সরাসরি হস্তান্তর করা উচিত। রেকর্ড রাখার জন্য একটি ছোট নোট বা রিসিট তৈরি করা উচিত: পেয়ে থাকবার সময়, যে ব্যক্তি পেয়েছে, এবং যাকে হস্তান্তর করা হলো—এগুলো লিখে রাখা ভালো। যদি মালিকের ঠিকানা রয়েছে, প্রথমে ফোন করে মিটিং ঠিক করা যেতে পারে, বা পুলিশ মাধ্যমে দেওয়ার পর মালিককে জানানো যেতে পারে।

গ উত্তর: মালিক যদি শনাক্ত হন, তিনি প্রথমে রিলিফ ও কৃতজ্ঞতা প্রকাশ করবেন; সম্ভবত তিনি ছেলেটিকে ধন্যবাদ জানাবেন, এবং প্রয়োজনে পুরস্কার বা উপহার দিতে পারেন। পুরস্কার নিলে ছেলেটিকে বিনীতভাবে গ্রহণ করতে হবে এবং মালিককে বলতেই হবে যে সে ঠিক কাজ করেছিল। সমাজে এমন সততা উদাহরণ হিসেবে তুলে ধরা যেতে পারে—বিদ্যালয় বা স্থানীয় সংবাদে ছোটখাটো ভূয়সী প্রশংসা বা স্কুল থেকে স্বীকৃতি মিলতে পারে।

ঘ উত্তর: নৈতিক শিক্ষা: 'সত্যনিষ্ঠা ও দায়িত্বশীলতা'—অতিরিক্ত অর্থে ক্লান্তি আসলেও সঠিক কাজ করা শেষ পর্যন্ত বড় সুবিধা আনে। ভবিষ্যতে এই ধরনের সিদ্ধান্ত শিশুটিকে বিশ্বাসযোগ্য, সম্মানিত ও শান্তিপূর্ণ নাগরিক হিসেবে গড়ে তুলবে; পাশাপাশি সামাজিক সম্পর্ক ও সম্মান বাড়বে।

Explanation:
এই পরিস্থিতি বিশ্লেষণ করলে দেখা যায়—কারও নিখুঁত হতে পারে তাত্ক্ষণিক লাভের প্রলোভন, কিন্তু দীর্ঘমেয়াদি নৈতিক ও সামাজিক ফলাফল গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। প্রথমে নিস্তেজ না হয়ে দায়িত্বশীল বড়দের জানানোর কারণ: ১) অনুমানহীন সিদ্ধান্ত (যেমন নিজের রাখা) আইনি ও নৈতিক সমস্যা সৃষ্টি করতে পারে; ২) পুলিশ/কমিউনিটি সেন্টারের মাধ্যমে ফেরত দিলে মালিক দ্রুত ও নিরাপদে পাবে; ৩) রেকর্ড বজায় রাখলে ভুল বোঝাবুঝি এড়ানো যায়। মালিকের কৃতজ্ঞতা ও সম্ভাব্য পুরস্কার হল প্রতীকী—মতো করে বলা যায় এই ধরনের আচরণ সমাজে অনুকরণীয় হিসেবে দেখা হয়। মোটকথা, ছোট বেলায় গৃহীত সততা বড় চরিত্রকে গড়ে তোলে।

          8:30 AM–12:30 PM — College/classes
          2:00–6:00 PM — Part-time job (Mon, Wed, Fri)
          8:00–10:00 PM — Chemistry (notes & past paper)
- Tuesday: 6:00–8:00 AM — English (reading & writing)
           8:30 AM–12:30 PM — College
           4:00–7:00 PM — Self-study: Biology (diagrams)
           8:00–10:00 PM — Revision: weak topics
- Wednesday: same as Monday
- Thursday: 6:00–9:00 PM — Extra study session (no job)
- Friday: same as Monday
- Saturday: 9:00 AM–1:00 PM — Mock test / timed practice
            3:00–6:00 PM — Review mock answers
            8:00–10:00 PM — Light revision & rest
- Sunday: 9:00 AM–12:00 PM — Consolidation & notes
          Afternoon — rest / family time
Week 2
- Keep the same morning routine; swap subjects so each subject gets at least two focused sessions per week. Reserve weekend for longer practice tests and topic revision. Limit work shifts to 12–15 hours per week maximum so evenings and mornings remain for study.

গ
Three strategies to prevent job interfering with study:
1) Strict time boundaries: Fix fixed hours for the job (e.g., late afternoon only) and protect morning best-study hours and two evening hours for focused revision. No overtime during exam months.
2) Prioritize tasks and use focused study techniques: Use Pomodoro (25–45 min study blocks with short breaks), active recall, and past papers to gain maximum learning in limited time.
3) Regular monitoring and flexibility: Weekly self-assessment (quick quizzes or mock sections) to spot falling performance; if marks drop or fatigue increases, reduce work hours immediately and reallocate time to study.

ঘ
Closing paragraph:
I know you want the best for me, and I appreciate your care. Please trust my plan for a few weeks — if the balance doesn't work I will stop the job. Your support and occasional check-ins mean a lot to me. Thank you for believing in me.

With affection,
[Your Name]

Explanation:
This solution combines reassurance (personal message), a concrete timetable (so the father can see study hours are protected), practical strategies (time boundaries, effective study methods, monitoring), and a respectful closing asking for support. Including a sample timetable demonstrates realistic time management, while the strategies focus on maximizing learning efficiency and ensuring flexibility so work can be reduced if needed.

Question:
Your elder sister messaged you after seeing your recent low scores in mock exams; she fears you might fail the HSC. You need to respond, accept responsibility where appropriate, and present a clear recovery plan to regain her confidence.

Options:
ক. Write a calm, honest reply to your sister explaining the reasons for the low mock scores and acknowledging any mistakes.
খ. List five concrete actions you will take in the next month to improve your marks (include study methods and resources).
গ. Draft a short weekly checkpoint message you will send your sister to keep her informed of progress.
ঘ. Write one paragraph explaining how you'll manage stress and stay motivated during this improvement period.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক
Dear Didi,

Thank you for caring — I know the mock results were disappointing. I want to be honest: I underestimated the exam format and spent too much time on easier topics while neglecting tougher ones. I also allowed distractions (phone/social apps) to cut into study time. I take full responsibility and I'm ready to work harder.

Please don't worry; I have a recovery plan and I want your support.

Love,
[Your Name]

খ
Five actions for the next month:
1) Topic gap analysis: Spend two days identifying weakest chapters from each subject using the mock answer scripts.
2) Focus blocks: Daily 90-minute focused sessions for each weak subject using active recall and spaced repetition.
3) Past papers: Complete one full past-paper twice weekly under timed conditions; review mistakes immediately and log them.
4) Extra help: Attend one additional tutoring session per week for the two weakest subjects and form a weekly study group with classmates for peer teaching.
5) Resource optimization: Use specific resources — standard textbooks for theory, past HSC solution collections, online video lessons for difficult concepts, and concise flashcards for last-minute revision.

গ
Weekly checkpoint message (example to send every Sunday evening):
"Didi, weekly update: Completed 3 timed past-paper sections, improved average score in Biology from 55% to 68% in chapter tests, attended two extra tutoring sessions, and revised chapters 4–6 in Math. Plan for next week: full Math past paper and two Chemistry focused sessions. Feeling more confident. Love, [Your Name]."

ঘ
Managing stress and motivation:
I will build short daily routines that include 30 minutes of light exercise and 10 minutes of mindfulness to reduce anxiety. I will set small measurable goals (e.g., increase chapter test score by 10% per week) and celebrate small wins. Regular sleep, short breaks during study (Pomodoro), and keeping in touch with you for encouragement will help me stay motivated and avoid burnout.

Explanation:
This solution is honest about causes, provides a practical recovery plan with measurable steps, and sets up accountability by promising weekly updates. The five actions combine diagnosis, focused study, practice, external help, and resource use. The checkpoint message is concise and informative, giving the sister confidence through measurable improvements. Stress-management techniques are practical and evidence-based (exercise, sleep, small wins) to keep motivation steady.

Question:
Your HSC teacher emailed expressing concern because you missed several classes due to illness and asked you to explain how you will catch up and request any necessary accommodations. Prepare a professional reply and a catch-up plan.

Options:
ক. Write a polite email reply to the teacher explaining your absence and expressing willingness to catch up.

গ. State two reasonable accommodations you might request from the teacher (e.g., deadline extension, extra marking), and justify each.
ঘ. Explain how you will ensure you do not fall behind again (two preventive measures).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক
Subject: Catching up after recent illness

Dear Sir/Madam,

Thank you for your concern. I was unwell for five days with a high fever and followed the doctor's advice to rest. I apologize for missing your classes. I am committed to making up for the lost time and would appreciate any guidance or materials you recommend.

Below I have outlined a three-week catch-up plan and I would be grateful if you could confirm whether I should prioritize any particular topics or if there are handouts I missed. If possible, I would appreciate a short meeting (or emailed feedback) after I complete the plan.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

খ
Three-week catch-up plan:
Week 1 (Topics A & B — foundational):
- Day 1: Obtain class notes and handouts; list all missed topics.
- Day 2: Read textbook sections for Topic A; create summary notes and concept maps.
- Day 3: Watch recommended lecture/video on Topic A; solve 10 practice problems.
- Day 4: Topic B reading and summary.
- Day 5: Attempt past paper questions related to A & B; mark and list mistakes.
- Weekend: Meet a classmate or tutor for 1-hour discussion to clarify doubts.
Week 2 (Topic C & D — application):
- Days 1–3: Deep study of Topic C with solved examples; do timed practice set.
- Days 4–5: Topic D focused study and group discussion.
- Weekend: Complete a mixed practice test covering A–D; send answers to teacher if requested.
Week 3 (Revision & assessment):
- Day 1: Review all summaries and flashcards for weak points.
- Day 2: Take another timed past-paper and self-assess.
- Day 3: Meet teacher for feedback (or email scanned answers) and correct errors.
- Remaining days: Final consolidation and plan for upcoming classes.
Deadlines: Finish Week 1 topics by end of first full week after recovery; Week 2 by the end of the second week; Week 3 consolidation finished before next major test.

গ
Two reasonable accommodations and justification:
1) Short deadline extensions for assignments due during the illness period: Justification — missed classes prevented me from receiving in-class explanations; a short extension (3–5 days) will allow submission of higher-quality work and demonstrate true understanding.
2) Opportunity for brief remedial feedback session (10–15 minutes) or the option to send solutions by email for review: Justification — targeted feedback will correct misunderstandings early and prevent repeated errors, helping me catch up faster and not burden future classes.

ঘ
Two preventive measures to avoid falling behind again:
1) Early communication: If I become ill or foresee absence, I will inform you promptly and request class notes so I can study immediately.
2) Build a short buffer: Maintain concise personal notes and recordings (where allowed) for each class so I can review the day’s lesson quickly if absent. Also arrange one weekly 30-minute peer-review with a classmate to stay aligned with class progress.

Explanation:
The email is polite and professional, acknowledges responsibility, and asks for teacher guidance. The catch-up plan breaks topics into manageable weekly goals with concrete activities (reading, videos, practice, peer discussion) and deadlines to show commitment. The accommodations requested are reasonable and justified by the disruption caused by illness. Preventive steps emphasize communication and small systems (notes/peer-review) that reduce the chance of falling behind in the future.

1) Official transcripts and whether scanned copies are acceptable initially.
2) Detailed course descriptions or syllabi (what level of detail is needed: learning outcomes, reading lists, assessment methods?).
3) Whether course outlines must be translated or notarized.
4) Number and format of reference letters (if any) and whether a letter from my current registrar is needed to confirm enrolment status.

Also please confirm processing times for preliminary assessments.

Subject: Application Fee Waiver & Transfer Deadlines for International Students

Dear Admissions Office,

I have two quick queries regarding the application:

1) Do you offer application fee waivers for international transfer applicants in financial hardship or for applicants who have already paid at partner institutions? If yes, what evidence is required and how to request a waiver?
2) What are the deadlines specifically for transfer applicants for the upcoming intake, and are there different deadlines for international versus domestic transfers?
3) Does my current international student status (visa holding) at another country affect eligibility or document requirements?

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Subject: Recognition of Professional Qualifications & Work Experience for Advanced Standing

Dear Admissions / Faculty Office,

Alongside my university coursework, I have [X] years of relevant professional experience and hold the [Name of Professional Qualification]. Could you please advise:

1) Whether Maple Ridge University considers professional qualifications or work experience for course exemptions or advanced standing.
2) What documentation is required (detailed CV, employment letters, professional certificates), and whether a portfolio or employer reference is helpful.
3) The approximate timeline and criteria used to evaluate such claims.

I look forward to your guidance on how best to present my professional background for assessment.

Kind regards,
[Your Name]


Explanation:
Each email is targeted to a specific administrative need: credit transfer rules, documentation, fees/deadlines, and recognition of professional experience. Use precise subject lines and numbered lists so staff can answer each point clearly. For credit transfer, request explicit grade and course-equivalence criteria. For document submission, ask about acceptable formats, translations and initial provisional assessments. For fee waivers, ask about eligibility and evidence, since policies differ between universities. For professional recognition, include details about the type of qualification and documentation to streamline evaluation.

Options:
ক. Write an email congratulating your friend. Include a subject line, a warm opening, two short paragraphs praising specific strengths that led to the win, an offer of help for international preparation, and a closing.
খ. Write a short instant message (2–3 lines) you can send immediately.

ঘ. Suggest two practical ways you can help your friend prepare for the international forum (one academic/practice-related, one logistical/emotional).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক
Subject: Huge Congratulations — National Champion and Best Wishes for the International Forum!

Dear [Friend's Name],

I was thrilled to hear you won first prize at the national debate — what an outstanding achievement! Your clarity of thought, sharp rebuttals and calm presence under pressure truly set you apart on stage.

Your disciplined research and ability to weave facts with persuasive storytelling made your arguments irresistible. I have no doubt you'll represent our region brilliantly at the international forum.

If you’d like, I can help by organising mock debates with friends, compiling source material on likely topics, or managing travel and scheduling details so you can focus on practice. Please tell me how I can support you.

Warmest congratulations again — you deserve all the applause.

With pride and best wishes,
[Your Name]

খ
Wow — you did it! Huge congrats on the national win and good luck representing us internationally — I’m here to help however you need!

গ
1) It validates your skills publicly and opens doors to scholarships, mentorships and networks.
2) It inspires younger debaters and raises the profile of our debate community.
3) It strengthens your CV and demonstrates leadership, critical thinking and communication to future institutions or employers.

ঘ
1) Academic/practice: Set up a weekly mock-debate schedule with varied topics and impartial judges, plus targeted feedback sessions focusing on rebuttal structure and time management.
2) Logistical/emotional: Manage travel arrangements and create a calming pre-event routine (brief mindfulness or breathing practice, a concise notes packet) so they arrive rested and confident.

Explanation:
The email uses a clear subject, warm opening, and two targeted paragraphs: one praising specific skills (clarity, rebuttal, stage presence) and one offering help — that structure balances celebration and practical support. The instant message is short and immediate, ideal for quick mobile responses. The three reasons show how wins extend beyond awards: opportunities, inspiration, and employability — useful talking points for a congratulatory note. The two help suggestions are concrete and complementary: practice-focused (improves performance) and logistical/emotional (reduces stress), both important for success at international events.

Question:
Your younger sister won 'Best Speaker' in her school debate competition. The family is planning a small celebration tonight, and you have to both praise her publicly at dinner and send a private encouraging note to help her keep improving.

Options:
ক. Write a short, heartfelt email to your sister congratulating her (subject + 3–4 sentences).
খ. Prepare a 40–60 word speech to deliver at the family dinner praising her achievement.
গ. Give three one-line compliments you can write on a celebratory card.
ঘ. Offer two constructive, age-appropriate tips to help her become even better at debating.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক
Subject: So Proud of You — Best Speaker Winner!

Dear [Sister's Name],

Congratulations on winning Best Speaker — what an amazing accomplishment! Your confidence, preparation and ability to connect with the audience were obvious. Keep practising that calm delivery and curious mindset; you have a real gift. I’m so proud of you and can’t wait to celebrate tonight.

Love,
[Your Name]

খ
Tonight we celebrate not just a trophy but the hours of hard work behind it. [Sister's Name], your voice convinced judges and moved the room — keep that warmth and precision. We’re all so proud of how you stood up, spoke clearly, and showed true leadership.

গ
1) "Your words carried both logic and heart — congratulations, champion!"
2) "You made every argument look effortless — so proud of you!"
3) "A brilliant speaker today, a confident leader tomorrow — well done!"

ঘ
1) Practice structuring responses using the PREP method (Point — Reason — Example — Point) so rebuttals stay concise and persuasive.
2) Record a few practice speeches on your phone and review them to notice voice variation and pacing; small tweaks can boost clarity and confidence.

Explanation:
The sister's email is warm and personal: subject plus concise paragraphs emphasizing pride and specific strengths (confidence, audience connection). The dinner speech is slightly more formal and celebratory, appropriate for a family setting. The card compliments are short, memorable lines suitable for quick reading. The tips are age-appropriate and actionable: PREP gives a clear structure younger debaters can use immediately; self-recording promotes concrete self-awareness and improvement without harsh criticism.

[Colleague's Name] secured first prize at the inter-university debate through incisive arguments and exemplary composure. Join us in congratulating them and attend their guest talk next Friday to hear their winning approach.

গ
1) Confirm talk date/time and reserve AV equipment at least 72 hours in advance.
2) Prepare a 10–12 minute core talk and a 5–10 minute Q&A plan.
3) Create 3–5 key takeaway slides — one idea per slide, visually simple.
4) Schedule two rehearsal runs: one alone (content) and one with a small mock audience (timing and feedback).
5) Prepare a one-page handout or reading list to share with attendees.

ঘ
1) Event-based: Host a formal departmental reception after the guest talk where the winner receives a certificate and a short commendation from the head of department.

Explanation:
The formal email follows a professional template: subject, polite salutation, praise with specifics (analysis, composure), club-level recognition, and an offer of support. The newsletter blurb is short and informative, inviting the community to the talk. The checklist prioritises logistics (AV, scheduling), content preparation (core talk and takeaways), practice, and audience value (handout). Recognition options balance immediate celebration (reception) and lasting acknowledgement (honours board and website), which both motivate the winner and highlight departmental excellence.

Question:
You are Laila. Write a short postcard-style message to your cousin abroad describing a monsoon evening in a village in Bangladesh and inviting them to visit sometime.

Options:
ক. Write a friendly opening sentence addressing your cousin.
খ. Describe three sensory details (one for sight, one for sound, one for smell) that capture the monsoon evening—one sentence each.
গ. Write a one-sentence invitation asking your cousin to come visit during the dry season.
ঘ. Write a warm closing and sign-off (one sentence).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Hi Amina — thinking of you as the monsoon paints our village in shades of green and silver.

খ Sight: From my veranda I see rice fields shimmering under sheets of rain, tiny rivulets weaving like silver threads between the paddies.
Sound: The steady drum of rain on tin roofs mixes with distant laughter and the croak of frogs.
Smell: The air smells of wet earth and crushed pandan leaves, warm and sweet after the first downpour.

গ Come visit next winter when the skies are clear and we can boat along slow rivers and walk the sunlit tea gardens together.

ঘ Miss you — take care and write back soon; with love, Laila.

Explanation:
The postcard-style answers follow a friendly, intimate tone suited to family correspondence. The opening (ক) establishes the addressee and mood. The sensory lines (খ) use concrete images: visual shimmer of rain on fields, auditory detail of rain and frogs, and olfactory detail of wet earth and pandan—these three senses evoke a monsoon evening vividly. The invitation (গ) contrasts monsoon mood with a dry-season plan to make travel comfortable and visually appealing. The closing (ঘ) provides an affectionate sign-off appropriate for a cousin. Each sentence is kept concise to match a postcard format.

Question:
You are Arif, writing an email to an international traveler to promote an eco-friendly weekend in the Sundarbans. Prepare short pieces of the email: a subject line, an opening, a wildlife-and-landscape description, and a call-to-action closing.

Options:
ক. Write an engaging email subject line (6–10 words).
খ. Write a concise two-sentence opening that introduces the Sundarbans and sets an eco-friendly tone.
গ. Write a 3–4 sentence paragraph describing the key wildlife and landscapes a visitor can expect.
ঘ. Write a persuasive call-to-action closing with a contact prompt (one or two sentences).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Discover the Sundarbans: Mangroves, Tigers, and Tranquility

খ The Sundarbans—our vast, UNESCO-listed mangrove frontier—is a living classroom for conservation and calm. Join a small, eco-conscious group to explore tidal creeks and support local communities while minimizing your footprint.

গ Glide through a maze of winding waterways framed by dense mangroves where kingfishers and spotted deer appear at the water’s edge. With luck and patient watching, you may glimpse the elusive Royal Bengal Tiger or see otters playing at dusk; boats threaded along quiet channels reveal heron rookeries, crab-rich mudflats, and fishermen launching small nets against the amber light. The landscape shifts with tides—an ever-changing tapestry of green, brown, and mirrored sky.

ঘ Ready to book a responsible weekend adventure? Reply to this email or call +88-XXX-XXXXXXX to reserve your spot and receive a detailed eco-itinerary.

Explanation:
The subject line (ক) aims to be concise and evocative for opening rates. The opening (খ) sets conservation-minded expectations and a gentle tone to attract eco-travelers. The descriptive paragraph (গ) balances wildlife highlights (tigers, otters, kingfishers) with landscape elements (mangroves, creeks, mudflats) and the temporal detail of tides to create vivid imagery while remaining realistic. The closing (ঘ) includes a clear call-to-action and a contact prompt so the recipient knows how to proceed; it emphasizes responsible travel to align with the eco-friendly theme.

Question:
You are Maya writing a short travel blog post about a sunrise river cruise on the Padma River. Prepare a title, the first paragraph, five photo captions, and three practical travel tips for readers.

Options:
ক. Write a catchy blog title (up to 7 words).
খ. Write the first paragraph (about 50–70 words) that paints the scene of the sunrise cruise.
গ. Provide five short photo captions suitable for images taken during the cruise.
ঘ. List three practical travel tips for readers planning the cruise (one sentence each).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Morning Light on the Padma

খ Before dawn the river is a sheet of quiet glass; as the sun lifts, mist peels from the water and fishermen’s boats become silhouettes against gold. Egrets launch like white flags, and children on the riverbank wave as our boat slips by, carrying the hush and slow rhythm of river life into the warming day.

গ 1. Dawn breaks over the Padma—gold on glass.
2. Fishermen haul in nets as the first light catches the ropes.
3. Riverbank tea stalls steam and wake the village.
4. A lone egret watches the current with patient grace.
5. Children race along the shore, laughter echoing across water.

ঘ 1. Bring a light waterproof jacket and a scarf—the morning mist is cool and damp.
2. Carry a small pair of binoculars and a telephoto lens for wildlife and candid river scenes.
3. Confirm tide and departure times with your operator; low or high tides change the route and landing spots.

Explanation:
The title (ক) is short, evocative, and optimized for a travel blog. The opening paragraph (খ) uses sensory language—visual (gold, silhouettes), auditory (laughter), and motion (boat slipping by)—to immerse readers in the experience and keep the word count in the requested range. The captions (গ) are concise and image-focused, each pairing a visual moment with a short phrase appropriate for social posts or a photo gallery. The travel tips (ঘ) are practical: clothing for mist, equipment for photographing wildlife and scenes, and logistical advice about tides and schedules—key considerations for a safe and satisfying river cruise.
