Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math](c)\rightarrow(e)\rightarrow (a)\rightarrow (d)\rightarrow (g)\rightarrow (b)\rightarrow (h)\rightarrow (f)[/math]Because of the inconceivable Covid-19 disaster, the entire world is passing a very difficult time. This disaster has changed the world scenario drastically. Due to this drastic change, people cannot decide what appropriately to do to fight this danger. They also find difficulties keeping pace with this change. Our education sector is undergoing the same critical condition. We are witnessing a serious education crisis that was once beyond imagination. However, there is a ray of hope. The hope is that with the problems, some prospects are also appearing.

Explanation:
Explanation: The best sequence is c, e, a, d, g, b, f, h because it moves logically from the overall cause (Covid-19) to its wide effects, then to specific difficulties and the education sector, and finally to emerging prospects and a hopeful conclusion. Sentences c–e set the context, a–d present problems, g–b narrow the focus to education, and f–h close with hope, creating a coherent paragraph.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math](f)\rightarrow(e)\rightarrow (g)\rightarrow (b)\rightarrow (h)\rightarrow (d)\rightarrow (a)\rightarrow (c)[/math]Haji Mohsin helped the poor and the helpless people with food and clothes. He was famous for his kindness. A thief entered into his bedroom one night. Haji Mohsin woke up and caught hold of the thief. The man said, "Sir, I am very poor, I have no food in my house." He took pity with the poor man. Haji Mohsin took him to another room and opened a box. The box was full of gold and money.

Explanation:
The correct order is (e) → (f) → (g) → (b) → (h) → (d) → (a) → (c) because the paragraph starts with Haji Mohsin’s reputation for kindness, gives an example of his help, then narrates the night incident (thief enters, Haji wakes and catches him), the thief’s plea, Haji’s pity, and finally Haji taking him to a room and opening a box that is full of gold and money — a clear chronological and cause‑and‑effect sequence.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math](iii)\rightarrow(ix)\rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(vi) \rightarrow(vii) \rightarrow(iv) \rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(x) \rightarrow(v) \rightarrow(viii)[/math]Once a gold necklace was lost from a rich man's house. Naturally it was suspected that one of the servants had stolen the necklace. All the servants were called and interrogated. But nobody confessed their guilt. So the owner of the house lodged a complaint in the court. The servants were summoned to the court but they denied having stolen the necklace. In order to find out the thief, the judge chalked out an intelligent plan. He gave each of the suspects a stick of equal length and said that one of the sticks would increase by an inch the next day. When the servants came to the court the next day, the thief had already cut off an inch of his stick. The judge found one of the sticks shorter than the others and in this way he could easily catch the thief.

Explanation:
The correct order follows the chronological cause–effect: first the necklace is lost ([iii]) and the owner complains in court ([vii]), so servants are suspected ([ix]) and summoned/interrogated ([i], [iv]); the judge then plans and tests them ([ii] → [x]), nobody confesses ([vi]), the guilty servant trims his stick to hide the change ([v]), and the judge finds the shorter stick and catches the thief ([viii]). This order is right because the linking words and pronouns (e.g. "he" = judge) and the sequence of actions (loss → complaint → suspicion → test → concealment → discovery) logically connect each sentence.

He died on August 29, 1976 and was buried in the compound of Dhaka University.

Explanation:
Correct sequence follows Nazrul’s life chronologically: birth (ix), childhood loss and early poetry (iii), army service at 19 in WWI (iv), return and turning to literature (V), marriage in 1924 (vii), prolific literary career (ii), illness and paralysis from 1942 (vi), repatriation after Bangladesh’s independence (1971) to Bangladesh in 1972 (vii duplicate), declaration as national poet (x), and death in 1976 (i). This order is correct because it matches the known dates and ages (born 1899, age 19 during WWI, married 1924, illness 1942, brought back 1972, died 1976), so arranging events by their chronological dates gives the proper life sequence.

His father Hazrat Shah Abdul Mukit was a pious man. At the age of six, he was admitted into a Furkania Madrasa and then he was admitted into an English School. He showed extraordinary credit in every examination of the school. In 1925, getting star marks he passed M.Sc in Chemistry from Kolkata Presidency College. In 1929, he passed D.Sc from Imperial College in England. He has made great contribution to the scientific research of Bangladesh. In 1953, he was appointed Chairman of Secondary Education Board. He made a great plan to give the new structure of education system. He died on 3rd November in 1977.

Explanation:
Correct sentences are (f), (h) and (j). (f) is correct because it uses a simple past statement with a clear subject and predicate. (h) is acceptable because the time phrase "At the age of six" plus the passive "was admitted" correctly shows when and what happened, and (j) correctly uses "was appointed" + position to state an official appointment.

Solution:
[math](e)\rightarrow(a)\rightarrow(d) \rightarrow(b) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(c) \rightarrow(g) \rightarrow(h) \rightarrow(j) \rightarrow(f)[/math]Once there was a king. The king was fond of knowing his future from the astrologer. A good astrologer visited the capital of the king. The king called him to the palace. The astrologer told something very unpleasant. At this the king got furious and condemned him to death. But another thought crossed his mind before the astrologer was removed for execution. The king then asked, "How long would you like to live?" He then thought for a while some ways to escape With ready wit he said, "The stars declare that I'll die only a week before your death".

Explanation:
Correct order: (e) → (a) → (d) → (b) → (i) → (c) → (g) → (h) → (f) → (j).  
Explanation: The sequence begins by introducing the king and his habit of consulting astrologers, then describes an astrologer’s arrival and summons to the palace, followed by his unpleasant prediction and the king’s angry sentence. Before execution the king hesitates, asks how long the astrologer wishes to live, the astrologer gives the clever reply, and finally the king (or astrologer) considers ways to escape—so each sentence logically follows the previous one.

His cousin Eurestheus, the king of Mycenae, made him undergo some difficult tasks. These huge tasks in Greek myths are called 'The Twelve Labours of Hercules'. One of the tasks was to slay a monster called Hydra that was ravaging the country of Argos. It had nine heads of which the middle one was said to be immortal. Initially, Hercules started striking off its heads with his club. Strangely enough, whenever Hercules knocked off a head of Hydra, two new ones erupted in its place. Eventually, with the help of Iolaus, his devoted servant, Hercules succeeded in burning all the heads except the ninth. Still challenge remained with the immortal one. However, with much effort, he buried the immortal head under a huge rock and completed the task successfully.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct logical sequence is (iii) → (vii) → (iv) → (vi) → (v) → (x) → (ii) → (i) → (viii) → (ix) because it first introduces Hercules and why he must do tasks, names those tasks, identifies the specific labour (slaying the Hydra) and describes the monster, then shows his initial action (striking) and the resulting problem (two heads growing), notes the remaining immortal head, and finally gives the solution (Iolaus burning the heads and Hercules burying the immortal head). This order follows a clear chronological and cause–effect flow, so each sentence naturally leads to the next.

On the 10th November 1863, a railway train was carrying him to a place called Gettysburg. He was going there to speak at a meeting. In the train, he was busy with writing something. He was not writing on a paper, but on the back of an envelope. On the envelope, it was what he was going to say at the meeting. The last words of the speech are: "Government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth." These words tell us what the best possible way of ruling a country is. In fact, the speech on the envelope is now famous as "Gettysburg Address". It is one of the finest and shortest speeches in English language.

Explanation:
Explanation: Statement (iii) is incorrect — the Gettysburg Address was delivered on November 19, 1863 (Lincoln traveled to Gettysburg around November 18–19), not on November 10. The other statements are correct: Lincoln was U.S. President, the Address is a short, famous speech often noted to have been drafted on the back of an envelope while he rode by train, and its closing line affirms democratic government.

Solution:
[math](viii)\rightarrow(x)\rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(iv) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(v) \rightarrow(iii) \rightarrow(vii) \rightarrow(ix) \rightarrow(vi)[/math]Nelson Mandela was the greatest leader of South Africa. In fact, he was one of the greatest leaders of the world who struggled against apartheid throughout his whole life. The blacks were treated cruelly. They were denied all basic human rights. They were aliens in their own country and were subjected to all sorts of indignities. Even dogs received a much better treatment than the blacks. The great leader vowed to put an end to the inhuman practice. He was thrown behind the prison bar. But the oppressive rulers could not break the spirit. Eventually, the great leader realised the goal of liberating his own people.

Explanation:
Sentence (viii) is the topic sentence because it gives the main idea — Nelson Mandela as the greatest South African leader — while the other sentences supply specific supporting details (the blacks' suffering, his vow, imprisonment, struggle and eventual liberation). Sentence (x) serves as a concluding restatement that reinforces the main point.

Explanation:
All the given sentences are historically accurate and form a coherent biography of Rabindranath Tagore: he was born in 1861 at Jorasanko, began writing very young (around eight), went to London at seventeen in 1878 and returned in 1880 without formal qualifications, and his London stay influenced him. He continued writing throughout his life, produced the acclaimed Bengali collection Gitanjali (for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1913), so each statement correctly describes a part of his life and work.

Solution:
[math](iii)\rightarrow(v)\rightarrow(viii) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(vi) \rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(x) \rightarrow(ix) \rightarrow(vii) \rightarrow(iv)[/math]Long ago, there lived a Sultan in a country. He wanted to appoint an honest man as his tax collector. So, he asked for the wise counselor's advice. Then he invited applications. A number of people applied for the job. The applicants were asked to meet the Sultan one by one. They came through a passage where gold coins were kept. When they all arrived, the Sultan asked them to dance. All the applicants blushed and refused except one. Then he found the desired man.

Explanation:
The correct order follows a simple cause–effect sequence: (c) introduces the Sultan, (e) gives his goal, and (h) shows he asks the wise counselor for a plan. The counselor’s plan leads him to (a) invite applicants and (f) receive applications, then (b) call them to meet; they (j) come through the passage and (i) are asked to dance as the test, after which (g) all but one refuse and (d) the Sultan finds the honest man. This ordering is logical because each sentence explains the reason or consequence of the previous one.

Solution:
[math](c)\rightarrow(g)\rightarrow(b) \rightarrow(d) \rightarrow(j) \rightarrow(e) \rightarrow(f) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(a) \rightarrow(h)[/math]Nobel Prize is the world's most important prize. The prize is given to persons with most outstanding contribution. The prize is instituted by a man who was the inventor of the science of destruction. He is Alfred Bernard Nobel. He was born in Stockholm on 21st October, 1833 and he died on 10th December, 1896. Though he is a citizen of Sweden, he was educated in Russia. Nobel Prizes are awarded every year for outstanding achievements in the field of science, literature and for promoting world's peace. Economics was added to the list in 1969 for the first time. One prize is awarded in each field. If there are more than one recipient of the prize in one field, the prize money is equally distributed amongst all the winners.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct statements describe the factual rules and history of the Nobel Prizes — Alfred Nobel (born 21 October 1833, died 10 December 1896) established prizes that are awarded annually for outstanding contributions in specified fields. The Economics prize was first awarded in 1969, and when a prize has multiple recipients it may be shared and the prize money divided among them. These points are supported by the Nobel Foundation’s rules and historical records.

He then sought the wise counsellor’s advice and set a test — asking applicants to pass (asked them to “dance”) through a passage where gold coins were kept — which revealed honesty because all refused except one, and thus he found the desired man.

Solution:
[math](c)\rightarrow(i)\rightarrow(g) \rightarrow(j) \rightarrow(a) \rightarrow(e) \rightarrow(d) \rightarrow(b) \rightarrow(h) \rightarrow(f)[/math]Once a lad went to a famous teacher. He had expressed his desire to acquire knowledge. He begged to instruct him in the arts and sciences. The teacher wished to find out the ability of the boy. He asked him where God was. The lad replied that he would answer if he would tell where He is not. The teacher thought highly of the boy's understanding. He praised him highly. He agreed to teach the lad. The boy devoted himself to earning knowledge.

Explanation:
Correct order: (c) → (i) → (g) → (h) → (j) → (a) → (e) → (d) → (b) → (f). This sequence is logical because it shows the lad arriving and asking for instruction, the teacher agreeing and then testing the boy’s ability, the test question being asked and answered cleverly, the teacher being impressed and praising him, and finally the boy devoting himself to learning.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math](iv)\rightarrow(ix)\rightarrow(v) \rightarrow(x) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(iii) \rightarrow(vi) \rightarrow(viii) \rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(vii)[/math]Aristotle was born in Greece. He was the son of a royal physician. His father wanted him to be a physician but he never cherished to be so. He wanted to be a free thinker. As a result, he studied under a great thinker named Plato. Plato taught Aristotle according to his own way. Later on, Aristotle took the pen to write on topics suitable for human civilization. 'Politics' is one of his famous books which exposes fullest development of his wisdom. He also wrote books on Biology, Literature, Economics and Comparative Politics. He is called the father of Biology because of his creativity.

Explanation:
The correct order follows a clear biographical and logical flow: it begins with his birth and family background, moves to his father's wish and Aristotle’s desire to be a free thinker (which led him to study under Plato), then mentions Plato’s teaching, followed by Aristotle’s later writing activity and the subjects he covered, his recognition as the father of Biology, and ends with his famous book "Politics." Each sentence therefore connects by cause–effect or topical progression, creating a coherent paragraph about Aristotle.

Solution:
[math](ix)\rightarrow(v)\rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(x) \rightarrow(viii) \rightarrow(vii) \rightarrow(iii) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(vi) \rightarrow(iv)[/math]One day Napoleon, the king of France, was walking along the sea shore. Suddenly he noticed a wonderful thing. An English boy was making a small boat. The boy was brought before him and he asked him what he would do with such a small boat. The boy said, "My country is on the other side of the sea." "I haven't seen my mother for a long time." "I shall cross the sea and go to my country by this boat." "Please let me go to my country." Napoleon was charmed by the words of the small boy. He made all arrangements to send him to his country.

Explanation:
The correct sequence puts the scene-setting first — Napoleon walking by the sea and seeing the boy make a boat — so the story naturally begins with (ix) and (ii), followed by Napoleon questioning the boy (x). The boy’s replies logically follow: he says his country is across the sea, expresses longing for his mother and asks to be allowed to go, and promises to cross by the boat — (viii), (vii), (i), (iii); these lines answer Napoleon’s question and create an emotional appeal. Napoleon’s reaction and the outcome come last: he notices something wonderful, is charmed by the boy’s words, and arranges to send him home — (v), (vi), (iv), which completes the cause–effect progression.

There was a remote village named Somal. The villagers were enchanted by a man. His name was Nambi. He lived in a temple at the edge of the village and passed his time under the banyan tree in front of the temple. He was so ignorant that he could not tell his age, but he could make up stories. He used to tell interesting stories to the people of the village. Before telling a story, he used to light a lamp in front of the tree. One day, he could not continue his story. After a few days, he called the villagers and told them something. He never spoke the rest of his life.

Explanation:
Correct order: (vi), (iii), (iv), (ix), (v), (i), (x), (vii), (viii), (ii). This order creates a logical story: it starts with the village and the man's identity, describes where and how he lived and his nature, then shows his ritual and storytelling that enchanted the villagers. The sequence ends with the turning point (he could not continue), the follow-up (he called them and spoke), and the final outcome (he never spoke again).

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Ans to the Q. no. 6.[math]\\[/math](v) → (i) → (ix) → (iv)→(x)→(ii)→(viii)→(iii) → (vi) → (vii)Once upon a time, there lived a fox in a forest. One day, he was very hungry. He searched food everywhere, but he did not get any food. At last, he entered into a vineyard. There were ripe grapes hanging up on the vine. The grapes were too high for him to reach. He took a run and jumped to reach the bunch of grapes but could not reach it. Again and again he jumped. But each time, he failed to reach the grapes. At last being tired, he went away saying that the grapes were sour.

Explanation:
Correct sequence is: (v), (i), (ix), (iv), (x), (ii), (viii), (iii), (vi), (vii). This order introduces the fox and his hunger, shows his search and entry into the vineyard where he finds ripe grapes that are too high, and then describes his attempts to reach them. Finally, after repeated failures he gives up and says the grapes are sour, which logically concludes the story.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Ans to the Q. no. 6(iv) (vi) (ix)→(x)→ (vii) (ii) (iii)→ (v)→(viii)→ (i)A snake lived in a hole at the foot of a tree. High up on its branches was the nest of a crow. The crow had four young chicks in its nest. Whenever the crow would leave the nest to bring food for its chicks, the snake would climb up and eat one. In this way, the snake ate up three of the chicks. The crow at last thought of a plan to get rid of its enemy. It stole an expensive necklace of the princess from the royal palace and dropped it into the snake's hole after scattering a few rubies here and there. The king became very angry at the loss and sent out men to look for the necklace. In course of time, they noticed the scattered rubies near the hole. They dug the hole, killed the snake, andtook the necklace

Explanation:
Correct order: (iv), (vi), (ix), (x), (vii), (ii), (iii), (v), (viii), (i).

Explanation: The sequence starts with the setting (snake in a hole and the crow’s nest with chicks), then shows the problem (snake climbing and eating three chicks), followed by the crow’s plan and action (dropping the necklace into the hole). Finally the king’s search leads to finding the scattered rubies, digging up the hole and killing the snake to recover the necklace, which preserves clear cause-and-effect flow.

Explanation:
Correct order: (iii) → (v) → (i) → (vi) → (ii) → (x) → (ix) → (vii) → (viii) → (iv).

Explanation: The story begins with the Sultan and his need for an honest tax collector, so he invites applications and people apply; they are made to meet him and pass through a passage of gold before being asked to dance, which exposes their honesty (they blush and refuse except one). After observing this, the Sultan asks his wise counselors for advice and then finds the desired man.

The Padma Bridge is a multi-purpose road-rail bridge over the (a) mighty/powerful Padma river in Bangladesh. It is the longest bridge in Bangladesh. At first the World Bank intended to (b) invest/spend for the construction of the bridge and later (c) overturned/withdrew their decision. But this mega project has been built with domestic funding without (d) foreign/any aid. It is 6-15 km long and 18-10 m wide. There is a four-lane highway on the upper level and a one- lane railway on the lower level. The construction journey was started on 7 December 2014 and completed by May 2022. The dream of Bengalis has come to the reality after (e) having/facing various uncertainties. The bridge was (f) inaugurated/commenced by the Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on June 25 of 2022.

The world has (j) seen/witnessed The historical achievement of the people of Bangladesh through this construction of the Padma Bridge. The Padma Bridge symbolizes Bangladesh's self-esteem.

Explanation:
(a) mighty — "mighty" describes a large, powerful river like the Padma, so it naturally fits before "Padma river."  
(b) fund — "intended to fund" means to provide money for construction, which matches the context.  
(c) reversed — "reversed their decision" is the correct phrase when an organization cancels or changes a prior decision.  
(d) foreign — "without foreign aid" indicates the project was built with domestic funding rather than external assistance.  
(e) overcoming — "after overcoming various uncertainties" explains that challenges were resolved before completion.  
(f) inaugurated — "was inaugurated" is the formal verb for officially opening a major project such as a bridge.  
(g) connected — "directly connected" correctly conveys linking the southwestern districts with the eastern part of the country.  
(h) promoting — "importance ... is promoting development" expresses that the bridge advances development.  
(i) standards — "living standards" is the common phrase referring to the quality of life of people.  
(j) recognized — "the world has recognized" suitably expresses global acknowledgement of this national achievement.

Explanation:
The phrase "acquired the status" is a common collocation meaning English has become that language, and "crossed national borders" correctly describes it spreading beyond countries. "Exclusive possession" fits the idea of ownership by native speakers, so "belongs" (to the world's people) and "outnumber" (bilingual users exceed monolingual natives) match the intended meaning. Finally, "a wide variety" expresses growing diversity, "have emerged" shows new varieties appearing, "respective" refers to each group's own mother tongues, and "moved away" indicates World English is no longer under native-speaker control.

Explanation:
The correct words are: (a) preparation, (b) fit, (c) is, (d) studies, (e) does, (f) other hand, (g) poor, (h) borne, (i) lost, (j) long.  
"Preparation" shows purpose for future struggle and "fit" follows the pattern "make him fit for"; "is" completes the clause about duty, while "studies" and "does" are the correct verbs ("he who studies... does well").  
"On the other hand" is the standard contrast phrase and "cuts a poor figure" means appears unsuccessful; "borne in mind" is the idiom for remembering, "lost time" is the usual collocation, and "long run" denotes future consequences.

Solution:
a) strong; b) temperature; c) by; d) around; e) state; f) lives; g) affect/destroy; h) ability/power.

Explanation:
Explanation: 
a) "strong" fits because "evidence" is usually uncountable and is described by adjectives like "strong" or "compelling" (not "many"). b) "temperature" refers to the global average temperature rise. c) "by" is the correct preposition with "caused". d) "around" means "surrounding the earth". e) "state" (i.e. say/claim) is the formal verb scientists use. f) "lives" is what can be harmed. g) "affect" or "destroy" are appropriate verbs depending on severity. h) "ability" (or "power") correctly names mankind's capacity to grow food.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a) gesture/behaviour; b) means/indicates; c) of; d) spend; e) have/show; f) follow; g) learn; h) varies.

Explanation:
Explanation: "Behaviour" fits (a) because "polite behaviour" is the correct collocation and parallels the noun "modesty." "Implies" fits (b) as a verb meaning "suggests," while "in" fits (c) because we say a virtue is "in a man"; "spend" fits (d) since being well-behaved does not require spending money. "Show" fits (e) for expressing willingness, and "follow" (f) and "observe" (g) correctly collocate with "code of conduct" and "norms of etiquette"; "varies" (h) is right because manners differ "from society to society."

Explanation:
The best fits are: "compelling" for (a) because it describes strong evidence, and "that the" for (b) to introduce the clause about the world's temperatures; "temperature" (c) names what is rising, with "by" (d) the correct preposition after "caused" and "in" (e) showing location (the atmosphere). "Agree" (f) expresses climatologists' consensus, "cause" (g) names the reason, and "health" (h) is what global warming may seriously harm—so the sentence correctly links increased CO2 in the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect, and risks to human health.

Adolescents (a) — on their (b) — their communities, schools, health services and their workplaces to (c) — a wide range of skills that can (d) — them to cope with the (e) — they face and make a successful transition from (f) — to adulthood. Parents, members (g) — the community service providers, and (h) — institutions have the (i) — to both promote adolescent development and adjustment and to intervene (j) — when problems arise.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) rely/depend; (b) families; (c) learn/acquire/attain; (d) enable/assist/help; (e) pressures/challenges/obstacles; (f) childhood; (g) of; (h) social/educational; (i) responsibility; (j) successfully/effectively.

Explanation:
Because adolescents depend on the people and institutions around them, "rely on" (or "depend on") fits for (a) and "families/communities/schools" are the natural agents that can "provide" (c) skills. "Enable" (d) is correct because it means giving the ability to do something, and "challenges" (e) correctly names the problems they must cope with while moving from "childhood" (f) to adulthood. In the second sentence, "of" links "members" to "the community," "educational" or similar describes the type of institutions (h), "responsibility" (i) is the correct noun after "have," and "early" (j) properly modifies "intervene" to show timely action.

Question:
We know that all species are (a) — for maintaining ecological balance. If one is (b) — the whole natural environment (c) —. In order to (d) — the environment from being spoilt, we should therefore protect (e) — wildlife. The good news is that many countries are now (f) — action to protect their (g) — wildlife.

Explanation:
Explanation: Every species plays a role in ecosystem functions (like pollination, predation and nutrient cycling), so the loss of one species can upset food chains and ecological balance. That upset can cascade through the environment, harming other species and ecosystem services we rely on, so protecting wildlife helps preserve the whole natural system. Conserving wild species and treating animals kindly therefore supports both nature’s health and human well‑being.

Dream is a series of thoughts, images and sensations occurring in a person's mind during sleep. Dream is a (a) — of unconscious wishes, thoughts and imaginations. It (b) — be sweet or horrible. When we dream (c) — pleasant, we call it a sweet dream. (d) — when we dream something extremely bad, we (e) — it a nightmare. Dream is meaningless if (f) — is a day dream.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a) representation/expression/reflection; b) may/can; c) something/anything; d) But; e) call; f) it; g) a; h) mental/ psychological; i) of; j) and.

Explanation:
Answers: a manifestation, b can, c something, d But, e call, f it, g a, h mental, i of, j and.  
'Manifestation' fits the meaning of a dream as an expression of unconscious wishes; 'can' shows possibility; 'something' and 'it' are the correct pronouns for the objects.  
'But' gives the contrast, 'call' is the verb used to name a nightmare, 'a' is the article before "real purpose", 'mental' completes the triad "mental, emotional and physical", while 'of' links "benefit of dream" and 'and' joins "thoughts and ideas".

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:
ক "rare" — "a man of rare genius" কথাসমূহ অতি প্রতিভাবানকে বোঝাতে প্রচলিত রূপ, এতে 'অসাধারণ প্রতিভা' প্রকাশ পায়।

Explanation:
Explanation: Each blank requires a word that fits both the grammar and the meaning of the sentence. For example, (a) needs a noun like "method" after "proper"; (b) needs a verb like "derive" meaning "obtain"; (c) needs an adverb such as "carefully" or "thoroughly" to modify "read"; (d) needs "merely/only" to show contrast with purpose; (e) needs a gerund like "passing" for "examination"; (f) needs the noun "interest"; (g) needs the verb "learn"; (h) needs a verb like "broaden" to go with "horizon"; (i) needs "mind" (or "knowledge") as the noun whose horizon is broadened; and (j) needs a verb such as "enrich" to express increasing the wealth of the mind. Each chosen word fits the required part of speech and preserves the intended meaning of studying for long-term growth rather than short-term gain.

Explanation:
Explanation: The historical narrative requires past-tense verbs and common collocations: (a) "occurred" (or "took place") and (e) "were fought" place events in the past, while (b) "were made" is the correct passive for "advances." The preposition (c) "for" fits "movement for democracy" and (d) "widespread" describes how it spread; (f) "also" links another negative development. (g) "birth" (or "creation") names Bangladesh's coming into being and takes the singular past verb (h) "was"; (i) "bloody" describes the war, and (j) "hold" completes the idiom "hold our heads high."

Question:
Beauty is easy to appreciate but difficult to define. If we look around, we will discover beauty in (a) — objects and sights in nature, in the (b) — of children, in kindness of strangers. But asked to define, we run into (c) —. Does beauty have an independent identity? Is it (d) — or relative? Is it dependent on our sense of (e) —? Does it lie in the (f) — of the beholder? Thus there will arise a number of (g) — in our mind. However, poets, artists, philosophers and thinkers (h) — always in search of beauty in their works and arts. But most of them have the common and undisputed opinion that where there is beauty, there is (i) — that is, a thing of beauty is a joy (j) —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) pleasurable; (b) laughter; (c) difficulties; (d) universal; (e) perceptions; (f) eye; (g) questions; (h) are; (i) joy; (j) for ever.

Explanation:
Explanation: The chosen words fit the natural phrases and ideas in the passage—beauty can be found in "everyday" objects and the "innocence" of children, and asking for a strict definition leads to "difficulties." The contrast "absolute or relative" suits (d) because the sentence poses a philosophical choice, and (e) "taste" and (f) "eye" match common usage ("sense of taste", "eye of the beholder"). (g) "questions" follows logically, (h) "are" agrees with the plural subject, and (i) "joy" with (j) "forever" echoes Keats' line "a thing of beauty is a joy forever," which explains the closing idea.

These choices fit both grammar and meaning: "sure of making" is the correct collocation, "know that" introduces the clause, "key to success" is the fixed phrase, "not sincere ... can never go a long way" is idiomatic, "value of sincerity" and "make a good use of" are proper collocations, "sincerely" is the adverb modifying "do work", "are sincere" matches subject–verb agreement, and "surely" correctly modifies "will be prosperous."

Explanation: The word "father" fits (a) because of the proverb "the child is the father of the man," meaning a child shapes the adult they become. "Future" for (b) and "nation" for (d) with "education" for (e) make sense because a country's future depends on children’s proper education. "Duty" (f) shows responsibility and "latent" (g) describes hidden talents that must be roused.

ক্রমানুসরণ নির্ধারণের জন্য আমরা ঘটনার কারণ-প্রভাব ও ক্রোনোলজিকাল নির্দেশনা অনুসরণ করেছি: প্রথম সমস্যাটি (বন্দুক/ডাকাত আক্রমণের কারণে বাণিজ্য বিপর্যস্ত), এরপর নির্ভরশীল নেতা নিয়োগের প্রয়োজন দেখা দেয় এবং আবেদনপত্র/প্রার্থী উপস্থিতি, পরীক্ষার ঘোষণা, পরীক্ষার ঘটনায় সহায়তার ঘটনা, পর্যবেক্ষক/পরীক্ষক-র প্রকাশ এবং অবশেষে পুরস্কার—এই সারি লজিকালি সাজে। অপ্রাসঙ্গিক বিবৃতি চিহ্নিত করার সময় আমি এই বিবৃতির সরাসরি প্রাসঙ্গিকতা বা গল্পের তীর্যকতায় অবদান না থাকার ওপর নজর দিয়েছি।

Question:
A busy inland merchant wanted an honest, accurate apprentice and administered a practical accounting test. The following scrambled statements describe what happened.

(A) A shrewd merchant needed a reliable apprentice for his busy inland shop.

(B) He posted a notice asking for applicants who could keep accurate accounts.

(C) On the first day, applicants were asked to balance a ledger from a complicated delivery.

(D) One applicant carefully counted and wrote down each coin, then paused to apologize and return an extra coin he had found on the floor.

(E) The others hurried to finish, claiming totals without recounting.

(F) The merchant observed which applicants corrected mistakes rather than hiding them.

(G) On the last day, the merchant took the chosen apprentice to his warehouse to show him the ropes.

(H) After hiring, the merchant sent a notice praising all the applicants equally.

(I) The chosen apprentice later became the head of the firm.

Options:
ক. উক্ত বিবৃতি গুলোকে যুক্তিসঙ্গত ক্রমে সাজাও (অপ্রাসঙ্গিকগুলো আলাদা করে উল্লেখ করো)।
খ. সঠিক ক্রমে সাজিয়ে একটি সংক্ষিপ্ত গল্প হিসেবে লিখে দাও।
গ. এই পরীক্ষায় কোন গুণ সবচেয়ে গুরুত্ব দেওয়া হয়েছিল এবং কেন সেই প্রার্থী বেছে নেওয়া হল? সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করো।
ঘ. উক্ত বিবৃতিগুলোর মধ্যে কোনটি ঘটনাটির প্রক্রিয়ার সাথে বেমানান বা অসমঞ্জস্য? কেন?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক সাজানো ক্রম: (A) → (B) → (C) → (E) → (D) → (F) → (G) → (I). (H অপ্রাসঙ্গিক বলে গণ্য করা হয় কারণ এটি সিদ্ধান্তকে মিথ্যা করে দেখায়)

খ অনুচ্ছেদ: A shrewd merchant needed a reliable apprentice for his busy inland shop. He posted a notice asking for applicants who could keep accurate accounts. On the first day, applicants were asked to balance a ledger from a complicated delivery. Most of the others hurried to finish, claiming totals without recounting, but one applicant carefully counted and wrote down each coin, then paused to apologize and return an extra coin he had found on the floor. The merchant observed which applicants corrected mistakes rather than hiding them, and after selecting the honest, careful applicant he took the chosen apprentice to his warehouse to show him the ropes. The chosen apprentice later became the head of the firm.

গ উত্তর: সবচেয়ে গুরুত্ব দেওয়া হয়েছিল সততা ও লিখিত হিসাব-সযত্ন (honesty and meticulousness)। যে প্রার্থী অতিরিক্ত কয়েন ফেরত দিলেন এবং ভুল ধরা পরলে তা সংশোধন করলেন—এই আচরণ দেখালো যে তিনি লাভের জন্য ত্রুটি লুকাবেন না এবং হিসাব-নিকাশে সঠিক থাকবেন। এজন্য তিনি নির্বাচিত হন।

ঘ উত্তর: (H) "After hiring, the merchant sent a notice praising all the applicants equally." — এটি অসমঞ্জস্য কারণ গল্পের বর্ণনায় merchant স্পষ্টভাবে একজনকে বেছে নিয়েছেন এবং ভবিষ্যত নেতৃত্বের কথা বলা হয়েছে; যদি তিনি সবার জন্য সমান প্রশংসা পাঠাতেন, তাহলে নির্বাচনের বৈশিষ্ট্য অর্থহীন হতো। তাই (H) ঘটনাটির ধারাবাহিকতায় প্রাসঙ্গিক নয়।

Explanation:
সাজানোর মূল নীতি: প্রথমে প্রয়োজন ও বিজ্ঞপ্তি, তারপর পরীক্ষা, পরীক্ষার সময়কার পৃথক আচরণগুলি, পর্যবেক্ষণ ও সিদ্ধান্ত, এবং অবশেষে ফলাফল। কোন বিবৃতি গল্পের মূল যুক্তি বা ক্রমানুসরণ ভেঙে দেয় তা নির্ণয় করে অপ্রাসঙ্গিক অংশ টিহচ করা হয়েছে। সততা ও লক্ষ্যভিত্তিক সতর্কতার কারণে নির্বাচনের যুক্তি পরিষ্কার—হিসাব-নিকাশে ভুল ঢেকে রাখলে পরে বড় ক্ষতি হতে পারে, তাই যিনি ভুল ধরেছেন বা ফেরত দিয়েছেন তিনি সেরা প্রার্থী।

Question:
A coastal captain needed a dependable first mate for a perilous coastal route. He devised a night trial to see how volunteers reacted under stress. Read the mixed statements below.

(a) A port city planned a voyage to explore a rocky island trade route.

(b) The veteran captain sought crew members with courage and prudence.

(c) He invited volunteers and designed an unusual trial: three tasks aboard the ship at night.

(d) Candidates were blindfolded and asked to find a safety lantern, tie a knot on a moving rope, and whistle a tune to signal readiness.

(e) Most candidates completed the tasks quickly but ignored warnings about tides.

(f) One candidate insisted on checking the anchor and adjusting a loose plank before finishing the tasks.

(g) The captain later revealed he had staged sudden wind gusts during the tasks to observe reactions.

(h) The cautious sailor who checked the anchor was promoted to first mate.

(i) The city held a banquet celebrating the voyage's departure.

Options:
ক. এই বিবৃতিগুলোকে যৌক্তিক ক্রমে সাজাও (যদি কোনোটি অপ্রাসঙ্গিক মনে হয় তা উল্লেখ করো)।
খ. সঠিক ক্রম অনুযায়ী পুরো ঘটনাটি একদল অনুচ্ছেদে লিখে দাও।
গ. ক্যাপটেন কোন গুণগুলিকে তুলনামূলকভাবে বেশি মূল্য দিয়েছেন? উদাহরণসহ ব্যাখ্যা করো।
ঘ. উক্ত বিবৃতিগুলোর মধ্যে কোনটি প্রধান পরীক্ষার কারণ-ক্রিয়া বা সিদ্ধান্তের সাথে সম্পর্কহীন? কেন?


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক সাজানো ক্রম: (a) → (b) → (c) → (d) → (e) → (f) → (g) → (h). (i খানিক আলাদা প্রসঙ্গ—উৎসব পর্বটি গল্পের মূল পরীক্ষার সিদ্ধান্তের সঙ্গে সরাসরি প্রয়োজনীয় নয়)

খ অনুচ্ছেদ: A port city planned a voyage to explore a rocky island trade route, and a veteran captain sought crew members with courage and prudence. He invited volunteers and designed an unusual trial: three tasks aboard the ship at night. Candidates were blindfolded and asked to find a safety lantern, tie a knot on a moving rope, and whistle a tune to signal readiness. Most candidates completed the tasks quickly but ignored warnings about tides, while one candidate insisted on checking the anchor and adjusting a loose plank before finishing the tasks. The captain later revealed he had staged sudden wind gusts during the tasks to observe reactions. The cautious sailor who checked the anchor was promoted to first mate.

গ উত্তর: ক্যাপটেন মূলত সাহস (courage) এবং প্রজ্ঞা/সচেতনতা (prudence, situational awareness)—বিশেষত বিপদের সময়ে বিষয়গুলো চেক করার প্রবৃত্তি—অত্যন্ত মূল্য দিয়েছেন। উদাহরণ: এক প্রার্থী দ্রুত ত্রয়ী কাজগুলো শেষ করলেও হঠাৎ দিক পরিবর্তন বা জলোচ্ছ্বাসে সুরক্ষা নিশ্চিত করেনি; অন্যদিকে প্রথম মেট হিসেবে নির্বাচিত প্রার্থী লুপ্ত-নজরের ভিতরে নিরাপত্তা (এঁকরো অ্যাঙ্কর ও প্ল্যাঙ্ক পরীক্ষা) নিশ্চিত করে যে তিনি নৌকো ও মানুষ দুটোই রক্ষা করতে_prioritize করেন।

ঘ উত্তর: (i) "The city held a banquet celebrating the voyage's departure." — এটি বেমানান কারণ গল্পের মূল ফোকাস ছিল প্রার্থী নির্বাচন ও পরীক্ষার আচরণ পর্যবেক্ষণ; শহরের বানকোয়েট ঘটনাটিকে পরে ঘটতে পারে, কিন্তু তা নির্বাচনের লজিক বা কারণ-ফল সম্পর্ক ব্যাখ্যা করে না, তাই অপ্রাসঙ্গিক বিবেচিত।

Explanation:
বিবৃতিগুলো সাজানোর সময় আমি ঘটনাক্রমগত লাইন ধরে চলেছি: পরিকল্পনা → প্রয়োজন নিরূপণ → পরীক্ষার আয়োজন → পরীক্ষার সময়কার আচরণ → পর্যবেক্ষণ/প্রকাশ এবং সিদ্ধান্ত। কোন অংশ কেবল পটভূমির সাজসজ্জা দেয় কিন্তু নির্বাচন প্রক্রিয়ার কার্যততের সঙ্গে যুক্ত নয় তা চিহ্নিত করা হয়েছে। ক্যাপটেন যেসব গুণ গুরুত্ব দিয়েছেন সেটি আচরণ ভিত্তিক: ঝুঁকিতে সহমান্যতা নয় বরং ঝুঁকি চিহ্নিত করে তা প্রতিরোধ করার কৌশল ও দায়িত্ববোধ।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক ক্রম: (b) → (e) → (g) → (a) → (d) → (h) → (c) → (f) → (i) → (j)

খ জীবনী: Dr. Sufia Rahman was born on 15 February 1930 in Mymensingh. Her father, Abdul Karim, was a school teacher who encouraged her studies. At age five she attended the local primary school in her village. In 1948 she received a scholarship to study at Dhaka University, and later she completed her MBBS with honours from Dhaka Medical College in 1954. She went on to earn a doctorate in public health from the London School of Hygiene in 1962. Dr. Rahman championed rural healthcare programs across Bangladesh and in 1980 she established the Sufia Medical Foundation to expand services. After retirement she wrote essays about women’s health and education. She passed away peacefully on 22 October 2005.

গ উচ্চতর শিক্ষা/ডিগ্রি নির্দেশ করে এমন বাক্য: (a), (d), (h).
- (a) বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে ভর্তি/স্কলারশিপ – উচ্চতর শিক্ষার সূত্রপাত নির্দেশ করে।
- (d) MBBS ডিগ্রী সম্পন্ন করেছে (উচ্চতর ব্যাচেলর/প্রফেশনাল ডিগ্রী)।
- (h) ডক্টরেট (ডক্টর ইন পাবলিক হেলথ) স্পষ্টভাবে উচ্চতর ডিগ্রী।

ঘ জন্ম: 15 February 1930; মৃত্যু: 22 October 2005.
বয়স হিসাব: 2005 − 1930 = 75 বছর. কারণ তিনি 2005 সালে তার জন্মদিন (15 Feb) পূর্ণ করে ফেলেছেন; মৃত্যুকাল (22 Oct 2005) তখনো তার 75 তম জন্মবছরের ভেতর, তাই তাঁর বয়স ছিল 75 বছর।

Explanation:
ক: বাক্যগুলোর কালানুক্রমিক সাজানোতে জন্মসংক্রান্ত বক্তব্য (b) প্রথমে আসে; পিতার পরিচয় (e) ও প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা (g) পরে অনুসরণ করে; বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ভর্তি/স্কলারশিপ (a) কলেজ পড়াশোনা শুরু হওয়ার ইঙ্গিত দেয়; MBBS (d) ও পরে ডক্টরেট (h) উচ্চতর শিক্ষার পর্যায় নির্দেশ করে; কর্মজীবনে স্বাস্থ্যচর্চা ও প্রতিষ্ঠা (c, f) পরে আসে; অবসরের পরে লেখালেখি (i) এবং সর্বশেষ মৃত্যু (j) অবস্থান করে।

গ: উচ্চতর শিক্ষা চিহ্নিত করতে বাক্যের মধ্যে সরাসরি ডিগ্রী বা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়/স্কলারশিপের উল্লেখ খোঁজা হয়েছে।

ঘ: বয়স নির্ণয়ের জন্য বরাবরই বছর গণনা করে দেখা হয়েছে যে জন্মবছরের জন্মদিনটির (15 Feb) পরে মৃত্যু ঘটেছে গত বছরের তুলনায়, তাই সরল বিয়োগব্যবহার যথাযথ।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক ক্রম: (b) → (c) → (i) → (d) → (g) → (e) → (f) → (a) → (h) → (j)

খ জীবনী: Anwar Hossain was born on 12 March 1945 in Chittagong. At age 12 he apprenticed under a master craftsman, Master Karim, who passed on traditional woodcut skills. He completed a Fine Arts degree from a Kolkata art college in 1966 and in the late 1960s began experimenting with printmaking techniques. His early exhibitions in the 1970s brought critical praise, and in 1985 he founded the arts collective "Kala Mancha". He received the National Art Award in 1998, later wrote an influential essay on modern Bangladeshi art in 2001, and passed away on 3 January 2010.

গ ক্যারিয়ারের প্রধান মাইলফলক/উপলব্ধি নির্দেশকারী বাক্য: (c), (i), (d), (g), (e), (f), (a), (h).
- (c) ও (i): প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা ও দক্ষতা-অর্জন (apprenticeship ও woodcut দক্ষতা)।
- (d): আনুষ্ঠানিক আর্ট শিক্ষার সমাপ্তি (ডিগ্রী)।
- (g): নতুন প্রযুক্তি/শৈলী অনুশীলন—সৃজনশীল উন্নতি।
- (e): প্রদর্শনীর মাধ্যমে স্বীকৃতি।
- (f): সংগঠন গঠন—জোরালো প্রভাববিস্তার।
- (a): জাতীয় পুরস্কার—উল্লেখযোগ্য স্বীকৃতি।
- (h): আকাদেমিক/নিবন্ধনমূলক অবদান।

ঘ জন্ম: 12 March 1945; মৃত্যু: 3 January 2010.
বয়স হিসাব: 2010 − 1945 = 65 বছর। কিন্তু 2010 সালের 3 জানুয়ারি তার জন্মদিন (12 March) এখনও আসেনি, তাই তিনি সম্পূর্ণ 65 বছর পূর্ণ করেননি। তাই মৃত্যুকালের প্রকৃত বয়স = 64 বছর। (সংক্ষেপে: তিনি 64 বছর এবং প্রায় 10 মাস বয়স ছিলেন।)

Explanation:
ক: প্রথমে জন্ম (b), তারপর ছোটবেলার প্রশিক্ষণ (c) ও মেন্টরের শিক্ষা (i), এর পরে আনুষ্ঠানিক ডিগ্রী (d) এবং 1960–এর শেষভাগে প্রিন্টমেকিং অনুশীলন (g), পরবর্তী দশকে প্রদর্শনী (e), তারপর 1985-এ সংগঠন গঠন (f), 1998-এ জাতীয় পুরস্কার (a), 2001-এ প্রবন্ধ (h) এবং শেষেই মৃত্যু (j)।

ঘ: সঠিক বয়স নির্ণয়ের জন্য জন্মতারিখ ও মৃত্যুর তারিখের মাস/দিন বিবেচনা করা প্রয়োজন; যদি মৃত্যুর বছর থেকে জন্মবর্ষ বিয়োগ করে এবং সেই বছরের জন্মদিন পার হয়ে গেছে কিনা চেক করা হয়। এখানে জন্মদিন 12 March, আর মৃত্যু 3 January — জন্মদিন পার হয়নি, তাই এক বছর কম ধরা হয়।

খ জীবনী: Professor Laila Chowdhury was born on 1 September 1940 in Sylhet and began formal schooling at age seven. She completed her M.A. in Education from Dhaka University in 1962. Supported by her husband, Dr. Minar, she pursued research and in 1983 published a widely-used textbook for primary teachers. She drafted the National Primary Education Policy in 1990 and later served as Director of Curriculum Development from 1995 to 2000. In recognition of her contributions she received the Ekushey Padak in 2002, retired in 2005, and passed away on 10 April 2015.

গ প্রকাশনা, নীতি ও পুরস্কার:
- প্রকাশনা: (g) — 1983 সালে পাঠ্যপুস্তক প্রকাশ।
- নীতিনির্ধারণ: (a) — 1990 সালে জাতীয় প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা নীতি রচনা।
- পুরস্কার: (h) — Ekushey Padak (2002)।
(উল্লেখ্য: (f) প্রশাসনিক ভূমিকা—ক্যারিয়ারের গুরুত্বপূর্ণ পদও বটে।)

ঘ জন্ম: 1 September 1940; মৃত্যু: 10 April 2015.
বয়স হিসাব: 2015 − 1940 = 75 বছর। তবুও 2015 সালের 10 এপ্রিল পর্যন্ত তাঁর 75তম জন্মদিন (1 September) আসেনি, তাই মৃত্যুকালে পূর্ণ বয়সে তিনি ছিলেন 74 বছর। (সংক্ষেপে: 74 বছর এবং প্রায় 7 মাস)।

Explanation:
ক: ঘটনাগুলোকে সাজাতে জন্ম ও প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা প্রথমে, এরপর উচ্চশিক্ষা ও পারিবারিক সহায়তা, প্রকাশনা ও নীতিনির্মাণ, প্রশাসনিক দায়িত্ব, পুরস্কার, অবসর ও মৃত্যু—এই ধারাকে অনুসরণ করা হয়েছে।

গ: প্রকাশনা ও নীতিনির্মাণের বাক্যগুলোতে সরাসরি 'published' ও 'drafted the policy' শব্দগুলো থাকায় সেগুলো চিহ্নিত করা হয়েছে; পুরস্কার (Ekushey Padak) সরাসরি স্বীকৃতির ইঙ্গিত দেয়।

ঘ: সঠিক বয়স নির্ণয়ের জন্য জন্মবর্ষ থেকে মৃত্যুবর্ষ বিয়োগ করে দেখতে হয় ওই বছরে জন্মদিন পার হয়েছে কি না; এখানে পার হয়নি, তাই এক বছর কম ধরা হয়েছে।

Question:
The following sentences about a traveling tinker and a mountain village are jumbled. Rearrange them so they form a coherent short narrative.

Options:
ক. Rearrange the sentences in a proper sequence.
খ. Which sentence should appear first? Write its number and full text.
গ. Which sentence marks the turning point or climax of the story? Give its number and explain why.
ঘ. Write a one-sentence summary of the arranged story.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (ii) → (v) → (iv) → (vii) → (iii) → (i) → (ix) → (viii) → (vi) → (x)

খ First sentence: (ii) "The mountain village of Dhol was cut off by snow every winter."

গ Turning point/climax: (ix) "The tinker showed them how to fix a broken plow and won their gratitude." — This is the emotional turning point because it changes the villagers' attitude toward the stranger: from curiosity and playfulness to genuine appreciation and reliance on him.

ঘ One-sentence summary: A lone traveling tinker arrives in the snowbound village of Dhol, wins the people's hearts by repairing their tools, accepts their hospitality, and is finally asked to stay when the road reopens.

Explanation:
Reasoning and cues used to order the sentences:
- Sentence (ii) describes the setting (a mountain village cut off by snow), so it naturally serves as the opening scene.
- Sentence (v) "One spring, the sound of distant drums drew him toward the valley" explains the tinker’s arrival and timing—placing it shortly after the setting introduction.
- Sentence (iv) "For seven years he had walked from village to village, selling his skills" provides background about his long wandering life and fits before details about his possessions and arrival.
- Sentence (vii) "He carried only a bag of tools and a battered copper cup" logically follows the background about wandering life, showing what he had with him.
- Sentence (iii) "Children ran after him, shouting and asking for repairs" depicts his immediate reception on arrival and leads to concrete actions.
- Sentence (i) "He hammered tiny bells into the broken cart wheel" is an example of his craft and precedes the more important repair that changes everything.
- Sentence (ix) is chosen as the turning point because repairing the plow resolves a practical village problem and shifts their attitude to gratitude.
- Sentence (viii) "An old woman offered him a warm stew and a place to sleep" and (vi) "At dusk he sat by the hearth and mended small toys" show the villagers’ hospitality and the tinker’s evening routine after earning their trust.
- Sentence (x) "When the road reopened, the people begged him to stay" serves as the close, showing the final outcome and the village’s changed wish.
Clues such as temporal words ("one spring", "for seven years", "at dusk", "when the road reopened") and cause-effect relationships (repair → gratitude → hospitality → petition to stay) determined the ordering.

খ First sentence: (i) "The keeper's name was Selim, and he had a small wooden chest of maps."

গ Turning point/climax: (iii) "A merchant's ship crashed on the rocks during a storm." — This sentence is the dramatic consequence of the lamp's failure and represents the story's tragic peak: the lighthouse's duty to warn failed and a ship was wrecked.

ঘ One-sentence summary: Selim, a devoted lighthouse keeper, faces a winter failure of his lamp; despite desperate makeshift efforts and villagers' help the light falters and a merchant ship is wrecked, leaving a coastline of debris and grief the next morning.

Explanation:
How the order was determined:
- (i) introduces the protagonist, Selim, and his maps—establishing who keeps watch.
- (v) "Years ago, he had promised the sea he would keep watch forever" gives his vow and motivation early on.
- (ii) describes his usual care: "Each night the lamp burned steady because he polished its brass before dusk," setting up the normal routine.
- (iv) "People whispered that the light sometimes blinked like a human eye" adds atmosphere and local rumor before trouble begins.
- (vi) "One winter, the brass mechanism stuck and the wick would not catch" introduces the mechanical failure—the inciting incident.
- (vii) "He climbed the spiral stairs and found the glass broken and covered in sea salt" shows the discovery of the fault and his immediate response.
- (x) "Heartbroken, Selim set up a makeshift lantern to warn passing sailors" shows his improvisation and intent to avert disaster.
- (viii) "The villagers sent a boy to borrow oil from the inland town" indicates the community’s attempt to help while the crisis unfolds.
- (iii) then follows as the tragic consequence when the warning was inadequate or too late: a merchant ship crashes.
- (ix) "The next morning the coastline was littered with flotsam but no survivors" closes the sequence with the aftermath.
Key clues: chronological markers like "years ago," "one winter," and "the next morning," plus causal language (mechanism stuck → broken glass → makeshift lantern → ship crash) guided the arrangement and selection of the climax.

Question:
Below are ten jumbled sentences about an old gardener and a miraculous seed. Rearrange them into a meaningful story and answer the questions that follow.

Options:
ক. Rearrange the sentences in a proper sequence.
খ. Which sentence should be the opening line? Provide its number and text.
গ. Which sentence signals the miraculous event and why is it pivotal? Give its number and explanation.
ঘ. Write a concise one-sentence summary of the arranged story.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (ii) → (x) → (i) → (iii) → (iv) → (v) → (vi) → (viii) → (vii) → (ix)

খ First sentence: (ii) "He found a tiny black seed under the roots of an old fig tree."

গ Miraculous event: (v) "One spring a silver tree grew overnight, its leaves shimmering in moonlight." — This is the pivotal miracle because it transforms the gardener's patient care into a visible, extraordinary result that changes the village's perception.

ঘ One-sentence summary: A solitary gardener plants and faithfully tends a mysterious seed despite mockery, and when it sprouts overnight into a silver tree whose fruits hold memories, the village's ridicule turns into wonder and reverence.

Explanation:
Ordering logic and narrative cues:
- (ii) "He found a tiny black seed..." is a natural story opener—an inciting discovery.
- (x) "He planted the seed near the village well and whispered a story into it" follows as the gardener's deliberate act after finding the seed.
- (i) "The gardener had no family but spoke to the plants every morning" provides character background and explains why he would whisper to a seed.
- (iii) "Neighbors mocked him..." sets up the conflict: social ridicule for his devotion.
- (iv) "He watered the seed through droughts and frosts without fail" shows perseverance across hardship.
- (v) is the miracle—overnight growth of a silver tree—marking the story’s major turning point.
- (vi) "Children climbed its branches and found fruits that tasted of memories" shows the magical, communal result of the miracle and its immediate effect on villagers.
- (viii) "The gardener pressed his palm to the trunk and felt his wife's laugh inside it" adds an intimate, emotional payoff for the gardener and explains the tree’s deeper meaning.
- (vii) "A scholar came from the city to study the marvelous tree" shows external recognition and curiosity.
- (ix) "At last the village stopped laughing and began to bring offerings" provides the resolution: public acceptance and reverence.
Temporal clues ("overnight", "through droughts and frosts") and cause-effect (planting + care → miracle → communal and personal consequences) informed the chosen sequence and identification of the miraculous event.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (c) → (d) → (e) → (g) → (h) → (f) → (b) → (i)

খ Once upon a time, a thirsty ant went down to drink at the river bank. The dove saw the ant struggling in the water and quickly dropped a large leaf beside it. The ant climbed onto the leaf and floated safely to the shore. After being saved, the ant wished it could repay the dove's kindness. Later a hunter came near and tried to catch the dove. The hunter raised his net to catch the dove when it came to the tree. Seeing its friend in danger, the ant crawled up the hunter's foot and bit him sharply. The dove flew away at once and escaped the hunter's net.

গ Be kind and help others; kindness is often repaid.

ঘ Characters: the ant, the dove. Setting: the river bank (near the river).

Explanation:
Order reasoning: Sentence (c) sets the scene — the ant at the river — so it must come first. Sentence (d) logically follows because the dove responds to the ant struggling. Sentence (e) completes that action (ant reaches shore). Sentence (g) expresses the ant's desire to repay, which naturally comes after being saved. Sentence (h) introduces a new problem — the hunter — so it follows. Sentence (f) shows the hunter's action preparing to catch the dove. In (b) the ant intervenes by biting the hunter, causing the outcome in (i) where the dove escapes. The moral and characters are inferred from the cause–effect chain and the actions of the animals.

খ One morning Raju found a tiny mango sapling at the nursery and decided to buy it. "I will help you grow, little tree," he said and carried it home with care. He dug a hole, placed the sapling carefully and covered its roots with soil. The sapling needed water and care to survive. Every day he watered it and protected it from goats and weeds. Years passed and that small sapling grew into a shady mango tree. Now many birds came to build their nests on the tree and neighbours praised him. One summer the family sat under its cool shade and enjoyed ripe mangoes together.

গ Two past-tense verbs: "found", "dug".

ঘ Title: "Raju's Mango Tree"

Explanation:
Order reasoning: (c) introduces the boy and the sapling, so it must start. In (f) Raju speaks and takes the sapling home; (b) describes planting the sapling next. Sentence (h) explains the sapling's needs, which leads naturally into (d) where Raju cares for it daily. (a) and (e) describe the long-term results (tree growth and birds), and (g) gives the final pleasant outcome of ripe mangoes shared by the family. The past-tense verbs were chosen by scanning verbs that clearly indicate completed actions. The suggested title captures the main subject concisely.

খ One day all the animals decided they could not live with the fearful lion any longer. The rabbit was chosen to speak to the lion because it was small and brave. The lion roared and asked who dared to oppose him. The rabbit led the lion to a deep well and told him there was another lion living inside. The rabbit waited until the lion looked into the well and saw his own reflection. The annoyed lion jumped into the well to fight the rival, and he could not get out.

গ The rabbit tricked the lion into thinking his reflection was another lion, prompting the lion to jump into the well.

ঘ Lesson: Cleverness and courage can overcome brute strength; wit is powerful.

Explanation:

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (c) → (a) → (g) → (b) → (e) → (d) → (f) → (h)

খ Mirza Karim was a local zamindar sympathetic to his people's hardships. He noticed that villagers had to walk long distances to fetch water and that many families fell ill from drinking brackish water. The river nearby had become saline due to tidal intrusion, worsening the crisis. He invited engineers to design a safe embankment and organized funds and local labour to construct a freshwater reservoir. The reservoir supplied drinking water for decades, and the success of the reservoir inspired nearby parishes to start similar projects.

গ সেরা শুরু: (c) "A local zamindar named Mirza Karim was sympathetic to their plight." — কারণ এটি প্রধান চরিত্র (কারিম) পরিচয় করায় এবং পরে তার কার্যকলাপ এবং সিদ্ধান্তগুলো ব্যাখ্যার জন্য প্রেক্ষাপট দেয়।

ঘ সেরা উপসংহার: (h) "The success of the reservoir inspired nearby parishes to start similar projects." — কারণ এটি কাজের দীর্ঘমেয়াদি প্রভাব এবং ফলাফলকে সারসংক্ষেপ করে, গল্পের শেষটিকে প্রাসঙ্গিকভাবে বন্ধ করে।

Explanation:
ক: ক্রমটি নির্বাচন করার সময় প্রথমে চরিত্রের পরিচয়, তারপর সমস্যা চিহ্নিতকরণ, সমস্যার প্রভাব, কারণ নির্ণয়, পরিকল্পনা ও বাস্তবায়ন, এবং শেষে ফলাফল ও প্রভাব—এই ধারাকে বজায় রাখা হয়েছে।

খ: অনুচ্ছেদটি সংহত হতে মূলত কারণ-ইফল কাঠামো অনুসরণ করেছে: সমস্যার বর্ণনা → কারণ → সমাধানের পদক্ষেপ → ফলাফল। প্রতিটি বাক্য পূর্বতর বাক্যের সাথে যুক্ত রেখে ধারাবাহিকতা বজায় রাখে।

গ: কাহিনীর শুরুতে চরিত্র/প্রেক্ষাপট উপস্থাপন করলে পাঠক দ্রুত বুঝতে পারে কে সমস্যা সমাধান করল এবং কেন; তাই (c) শুরু হিসেবে উপযুক্ত।

ঘ: উপসংহার হিসেবে এমন বাক্য শ্রেয় যা কেবল ফলাফল নয়, তার সম্প্রসারণ বা অনুকরণীয় প্রভাবও দেখায়; তাই (h) নির্বাচন করা হলো।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (c) → (a) → (b) → (e) → (d) → (f) → (g) → (h)

খ A Sufi saint, Maulana Atiq, settled by the coast to serve the community. The sandy coast was losing land every year to the sea, and people could no longer cultivate crops close to the shore. Initially, many were skeptical about planting trees instead of building walls. He taught villagers to plant mangrove seedlings along the tide line. Over time the mangroves reduced erosion and trapped silt; fish returned to the sheltered bays and livelihoods improved. His patient guidance changed the coastal landscape permanently.

গ সেরা শুরু: (c) "A Sufi saint, Maulana Atiq, settled by the coast to serve the community." — কারণ এটি প্রধান নায়ক ও তার উদ্দেশ্য উপস্থাপন করে, যা পাঠককে পরবর্তী সমস্যাগুলো ও সমাধানে প্রস্তুত করে।

ঘ সেরা সমাপ্তি: (h) "His patient guidance changed the coastal landscape permanently." — কারণ এটি দীর্ঘমেয়াদি পরিবর্তন এবং নৈতিক/শিক্ষণমূলক মূল্যবোধের উপর জোর দেয়, যা গল্পের উপসংহার হিসেবে শক্তিশালী।

Explanation:
ক: সঠিক ধারায় সাজালে আগে নায়ক ও তার উদ্দেশ্য, এরপর সমস্যার বর্ণনা, মানুষের প্রাথমিক প্রতিক্রিয়া, এবং তার পর কার্যপ্রণালী ও ফলাফল প্রদর্শিত হয়।

খ: অনুচ্ছেদটি কারণ ও প্রতিফলন দেখায় — প্রথমে সমস্যা, পরে সমাধান এবং শেষে তাৎপর্যপূর্ণ ফলাফল।

গ: চরিত্র-ভিত্তিক শুরু পাঠককে কার্যকরভাবে আবদ্ধ করে; তাই (c) শুরু হিসেবে নেয়া হয়েছে।

ঘ: (h) বাক্যটি শুধু ফলাফল নয়, টেকসই পরিবর্তন ও নেতার ভূমিকার সারকথাও তুলে ধরে; ফলে এটি উপসংহার হিসেবে সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (c) → (a) → (b) → (d) → (e) → (f) → (h) → (g)

খ An engineer named Rashid Ahmed returned from the city with new ideas. The low-lying town was prone to yearly floods that destroyed crops and roads, and many families had to move to temporary shelters during monsoon. He proposed a plan of raised embankments and elevated roads. Local people contributed labour after he held several meetings to explain the project. The embankments protected farmland and allowed trade to resume year-round; his project later became a model for other delta towns. The project showed how technical knowledge combined with community effort can solve recurring disasters.

গ সেরা শুরু: (c) "An engineer named Rashid Ahmed returned from the city with new ideas." — কারণ নায়ক এবং তার সম্ভাব্য সমাধান-দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি আগে উপস্থাপন করলে পার্লেই শুরু থেকে আগ্রহ জাগে এবং পরবর্তী সমস্যাগুলো ও পদক্ষেপের প্রাসঙ্গিকতা স্পষ্ট হয়।

ঘ সেরা উপসংহার: (g) "The project showed how technical knowledge combined with community effort can solve recurring disasters." — কারণ এটি প্রকল্পের সার্বিক শিক্ষণীয় দিক ও সাধারণীকরণ করে, যা পাঠককে মূল বিষয়বস্তুর মাধ্যমে ভাবতে বাধ্য করে।

Explanation:
ক: ধারাবাহিকতা বজায় রাখতে প্রথমে কারা জড়িত এবং তাদের ধারণা, তারপর সমস্যা, প্রস্তাবিত সমাধান, অংশগ্রহণ এবং শেষে ফলাফল ও প্রভাব—এই সিকোয়েন্স সুসংগত।

খ: অনুচ্ছেদটি বাস্তবকেন্দ্রিক: প্রকৌশলগত পরিকল্পনা ও স্থানীয় অংশগ্রহণ কিভাবে বাস্তবে কার্যকর হয় তা দেখায়।

ঘ: (g) বাক্যটি কেবল ফলাফল নয়, প্রকল্প থেকে পাওয়া শিক্ষা ও মডেল হিসেবে গ্রহণযোগ্যতাও প্রদর্শন করে; তাই এটি শক্তিশালী উপসংহার।

গ অহিংস নীতির নির্দেশক বাক্যগুলো: (i), (vi), (viii), (iii), (ix).

ঘ ফলাফল/উপসংহার: (vii) — "India eventually achieved independence in 1947." (এই বাক্যটি অনুচ্ছেদের তুলনামূলক উপসংহার যা আগের ঘটনাগুলোর প্রতিফলন হিসেবে দেশের স্বাধীনতার অর্জনকে উপস্থাপন করে)।

Explanation:
ক: সাজানোর যুক্তি — (i) দিয়ে শুরু করলে আক্রান্ত প্রেক্ষাপট পাওয়া যায়: তিনি শান্তিপূর্ণ প্রতিরোধ নেতৃত্ব দেন। (iv) মতো একটি নির্দিষ্ট কর্মযজ্ঞ (Salt March) সেই নীতির প্রাসঙ্গিক উদাহরণ হিসেবে আগায়। এরপর (ii) কর্তৃপক্ষের প্রতিক্রিয়া (গ্রেপ্তার), (v) বন্দীবন্ধনের পরও নৈতিক সম্মান বৃদ্ধি ও জনমত গড়ার প্রক্রিয়া দেখানো হয়। (viii) ও (vi) এর মাধ্যমে তার ব্যক্তিগত আত্মনিয়ন্ত্রণ ও নীতিবল ব্যাখ্যা করা হয়; (iii) সামাজিক আত্মনির্ভরতার সাংকেতিক বিষয় (spinning) উল্লেখ করে নীতির বহুমাত্রিকতা উঠে আসে। (ix) বিশ্বব্যাপী প্রভাব দেখায় এবং সর্বশেষে (vii) Independence-কে উপসংহারে বলা যায়।

ঘ সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: তার নেতৃত্ব (ii, x, v, iii) সারা দেশে মানুষের মনোবল ও সংহতি বাড়িয়েছিল; আন্তর্জাতিক স্বীকৃতি (vii) এবং ধারাবাহিক রাজনৈতিক চাপের ফলে আইনি সংস্কার (vi) কার্যকর হয় এবং শেষ পর্যন্ত সামাজিক-আইনি পরিবর্তন (viii) সম্ভব হয়।

Explanation:
ক: সাজানোর যুক্তি — প্রথমে সামাজিক বাস্তবতা (i) ও তার বিরুদ্ধে সংঘটিত সহিংসতা (iv) উপস্থাপন করলে প্রেক্ষাপট দৃশ্যমান হয়। এরপর (ii) মত নির্দিষ্ট কর্মসূচি ও (x) নেতৃত্বের ব্যাপক প্রভাব তুলে ধরা হয়। (v) তার ব্যক্তিগত ভূমিকা ও নৈতিক ভিত্তি জোরালো করে, (iii) তার ঐতিহাসিক ভাষণ আন্দোলনের উচ্চমাত্রা নির্দেশ করে, এবং (vii) ও (ix) তার ব্যক্তিগত স্বীকৃতি ও ট্র্যাজিক পরিণতি দেখায়। আইনি কায়দাপত্র (vi) ও সামগ্রিক ফলাফল (viii) অনুচ্ছেদের উপসংহার তৈরি করে।

খ: শিরোনামের যুক্তি — শিরোনামটি আন্দোলনের লক্ষ্য (নাগরিক অধিকার) এবং নেতৃত্ব থেকে অর্জিত পরিবর্তনকে সংক্ষেপে ব্যক্ত করে।

গ: সহিংসতার চিহ্ন — (iv) সরাসরি পুলিশী সহিংসতার উল্লেখ করে; অনুচ্ছেদে আর্থিক/আইনি চাপ ও সামাজিক প্রতিক্রিয়া দেখালেও ভেতরে (iv) মূল সহিংসতাকে নির্দেশ করে।

ঘ. এই আন্দোলনের দীর্ঘমেয়াদি প্রভাব কী—সংক্ষেপে ব্যাখ্যা করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক ক্রম: (i) → (ii) → (ix) → (iii) → (iv) → (v) → (vi) → (vii) → (viii).

খ শিরোনাম: "নারীর ভোটাধিকার: সংগ্রাম ও ফলাফল".

গ তীব্র/আন্দোলনভিত্তিক কৌশলের ইঙ্গিতকারী বাক্য: (iii), (iv), (v).

ঘ দীর্ঘমেয়াদি প্রভাব: নারীদের ভোটাধিকার প্রতিষ্ঠার ফলে রাজনৈতিক প্রতিনিধিত্ব বেড়ে, সামাজিক নীতিতে পরিবর্তন আসে এবং পরবর্তীতে ব্যাপক লিঙ্গ-সমতার আইন ও নীতিমালা (viii) গড়ে ওঠে; এটি নারীশিক্ষা, শ্রমবাজারে অংশগ্রহণ ও আইনি অধিকার বৃদ্ধির পথ সুগম করে।

Explanation:
ক: সাজানোর যুক্তি — প্রথমে সমস্যার বর্ণনা (i), তখনকার শান্তিপূর্ণ দাবি (ii), প্রধান নেতাদের উত্থান (ix), ধীর গতিতে আক্ষেপ ও রূঢ়তর কৌশলে রূপান্তর (iii, iv), সরকারের কঠোর প্রতিক্রিয়া (v), জনমতের পরিবর্তন (vi) ও আইনি সাফল্য (vii), এবং তা থেকে বিস্তৃত সামাজিক সংস্কারে যাওয়া (viii) — এই সিরিজে ঘটনাগুলো স্বাভাবিক ধারায় সাজে।

গ: তীব্র কৌশলের ব্যাখ্যা — (iii) নির্দেশ করে যে অসহিষ্ণুতা থেকে চরম পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া হয়েছে; (iv) এ ধরনের সরাসরি কর্মমুখী আন্দোলনকে নির্দেশ করে; (v) সরকারের প্রতিক্রিয়া (গ্রেপ্তার, জেলে বলবৎ করা) সেই তীব্রতার আশঙ্কা ও বাস্তবতা তুলে ধরে।

ঘ: দীর্ঘমেয়াদি প্রভাব — রাজনৈতিক অংশগ্রহণে নারীদের অন্তর্ভুক্তি সমাজ ও সরকারি নীতিকে পুনরায় আকার দেয়; ভোটাধিকার কেবল এক আইনি অধিকার নয়, বরং সামাজিক এবং অর্থনৈতিক অধিকারগুলোর জন্য ভিত্তি হিসেবে কাজ করে, যা পরবর্তীতে ব্যাপক লিঙ্গনিরপেক্ষ সংস্কারের পথ প্রসারিত করে।

ঘ. তিনি কেন ব্রিটিশ কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত খেতাব (knighthood) প্রত্যাখ্যান করেন? সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা দিন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Chronological order: (i) → (iii) → (vii) → (ii) → (iv) → (vi) → (v) → (viii)

খ Incorrect statement: none of the listed items are essentially wrong in substance. (All eight statements are broadly accurate. If precision is required: statement (iii) ‘about twenty-two’ — Rabindranath Tagore married Mrinalini Devi in 1883 when he was 22, so the phrase is correct.)

গ He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913.

ঘ He renounced the knighthood in 1919 as a protest against the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and generally to condemn British repressive measures in India.

Explanation:
ক (chronology): Tagore was born in 1861 (i). He married Mrinalini Devi in 1883 at age 22 (iii). His outspoken opposition to the 1905 Partition of Bengal and related protest songs and poems came later (vii). Gitanjali and the work that brought him international attention were published before and around the time of his Nobel recognition (ii). He was knighted in 1915 by the British (iv) and then, after the 1919 Amritsar events, returned that title (explained in ঘ). The Nobel Prize year (vi) is 1913, and later he established Visva-Bharati at Santiniketan in 1921 (v). He died in 1941 (viii).

খ (incorrectness): All statements are summary facts about major milestones; no outright falsehood is present. One could quibble about exact years or wording, but the content is historically correct.

গ (Nobel year): The Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to him in 1913 largely for Gitanjali and his profound lyrical poetry.

ঘ (reason for renunciation): Tagore publicly renounced the knighthood as a moral and political protest after the slaughter at Jallianwala Bagh (Amritsar, 1919) and as a statement against colonial repression. This action was widely noted as a principled stand by an eminent cultural figure.

গ. Which of the statements names a specific famous poem of his? Mention the poem and briefly state its central theme.
ঘ. Explain in a few sentences why his poetry is considered modern and influential.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Chronological order: (i) → (ii) → (iv) → (v) → (iii) → (vii) → (vi)

খ Incorrect statement: none of the given statements are essentially false. (All items correctly summarize the poet's life. If detail is required: statement (iv) could be made more precise with publication years; but it is not incorrect.)

গ The famous poem named is 'Banalata Sen' (statement iii). Its central theme: a meditation on time, longing and relief—an exhausted traveler finds peace and timeless beauty in the figure of Banalata Sen, combining personal melancholy with mythic imagery.

ঘ His poetry is considered modern because of its innovative imagery, free-flowing syntax, urban and existential themes, and departure from older romantic and devotional conventions; he brought a new introspective voice and striking visual metaphors to Bengali verse, influencing later poets significantly.

Explanation:
ক (chronology): He was born in 1899 (i), took up teaching and lecturing as his profession (ii), and began publishing collections from the 1920s onward (iv). Financial and professional difficulties recurred in his life (v). His best-known poems, including 'Banalata Sen', exemplify his mature style (iii). Over ensuing decades literary critics and readers recognized his importance as a modern voice in Bengali poetry (vii). He died in Calcutta in 1954 after being struck by a vehicle—an abrupt end to his life (vi).

খ (incorrectness): Summaries are accurate; no statement is clearly false. Precise bibliographic dates could refine (iv), but this is not an error.

গ (poem and theme): 'Banalata Sen' is famous for blending a personal odyssey with timeless mythic reference; it evokes rest, meeting the beloved as a symbol of solace, and contemplates history and loneliness.

ঘ (modernity): The poet broke with established meter and diction norms, introduced urban loneliness and existential introspection into Bengali poetry, and used compressed, image-rich lines that later poets emulated. These innovations mark his lasting influence.

Question:
(i) She was born around the 1880s in the northern districts of Bengal and married at a young age, but continued self-education throughout her life.

(ii) In 1905 she published a pioneering feminist utopian short story in English that imagines a world run by women.

(iii) She established a school for girls to promote female education against prevailing conservative attitudes.

(iv) She campaigned for women's rights, including the right to education and economic independence.

গ. Which statement refers to a specific literary work? Name the work and the year it was first published.
ঘ. Summarize in two or three sentences her major contribution to society.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Chronological order: (i) → (ii) → (iii) → (v) → (iv) → (vi)

খ Incorrect statement: none are fundamentally incorrect as summaries. (If precision is requested: in (vi) the phrase 'early 1930s'—she died in 1932, so stating the exact year clarifies the timeline.)

গ The specific literary work is the feminist utopian short story 'Sultana's Dream' (statement ii). It was first published in 1905.

ঘ Her major contribution: She pioneered advocacy for women's education and emancipation in Bengal, founded institutions (notably a school for girls), and used writing and public engagement to challenge restrictive social norms—laying groundwork for later feminist and educational reforms.

Explanation:
ক (chronology): She was born around the 1880s and, despite early marriage, pursued self-education (i). In 1905 she published 'Sultana's Dream', an imaginative feminist utopia (ii). She then worked to institutionalize girls' education by founding a school (iii). Through correspondence and bilingual writing she spread her ideas (v), campaigned for broader women's rights (iv), and died in 1932 leaving a continuing legacy (vi).

খ (incorrectness): The items are concise summaries of well-known facts; no statement is falsely stated. To be precise, giving the exact death year (1932) refines (vi).

গ (work and year): 'Sultana's Dream' (1905) is an early feminist fantasy in English that inverts gendered power structures to critique patriarchy and imagine alternative social order.

ঘ (contribution): By combining literary innovation with grassroots institution-building (a girls' school) and public advocacy, she opened educational opportunities for women and introduced feminist discourse into Bengali public life—an influence that persisted long after her death.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

খ Earlier that morning the young sailor had been promoted for courage at a surprise skirmish. The sailor had asked an officer to deliver the letter if he did not return by dusk. "Please tell my mother I am safe," the sailor had written, "and that I sail with honour." He approached the barracks with a folded, rain-spattered letter in hand. The general unfolded the envelope and read in silence. The general had lost his own son at sea many years ago. The general looked up and, with a rare smile, ordered a lantern lit for the boy's coastal village.

গ সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: কাহিনীতে দায়িত্ব, শূন্যতা ও সহানুভূতির মিল আছে। সাহসী কৃত্যের পরও সৈনিকের চিন্তা পরিবার ও নিরাপত্তার দিকে—এটি সাধারণিক মনকে স্পর্শ করে। জেনারেলের ব্যক্তিগত স্মৃতি সেই অনুরোধকে কাঁপিয়ে তোলে এবং সে ছোট্ট সহানুভূতিশীল কাজ করে, যা যুদ্ধের কঠোরতার মধ্যে মানবিকতার গুরুত্ব দেখায়।

ঘ উত্তর: (vii) — "The general had lost his own son at sea many years ago."

Explanation:
ব্যাখ্যা:

ক: (v) দেখায় ঘটনায় পূর্বশর্ত—সৈন্যের পদোন্নতি। এরপর (vi) তার অনুরোধ ও চাহিদা বোঝায়। (ii) হল চিঠির মূল বক্তব্য, যা (iii)–এ হাতে থাকা চিঠি হিসেবে প্রদর্শিত হয়। (i)–(vii)–(iv) অংশগুলো দেখায় যে কেমনভাবে জেনারেল চিঠি পড়ে ব্যক্তিগত স্মৃতি দ্বারা আবেগিত হয় এবং ফলশ্রুতিতে সহানুভূতিশীল কাজ করে।

খ: অনুচ্ছেদটি ঘটনাগত ধারায় সাজানো হয়েছে যাতে পাঠক সহজেই ঘটনার শুরু, চিঠির উদ্দেশ্য, প্রতিক্রিয়া ও সমাধান বুঝতে পারে।

গ: মানুষের অভিজ্ঞতা ও শোক কীভাবে অন্যের জন্য সদিচ্ছা অনুপ্রাণিত করে তা এই কাহিনী স্পষ্ট করে; যুদ্ধের মধ্যে মানবিকতা বজায় রাখাই মূল ভাব।

ঘ: (vii) সরাসরি জেনারেলের ব্যক্তিগত ব্যথা প্রকাশ করে এবং এই কারণেই সে লণ্ঠন জ্বালানোর মতো মৃদু কাজটি করে।

(e) The cloth seller said, "I am going to the market tomorrow. Please send your daughter with me to help carry the bundles."

(f) After a few days the cloth seller asked the tailor to return his measuring tape.

(g) The tailor sent his daughter with the cloth seller but she came back alone from the market.

(h) "A gust of wind carried your daughter away," replied the cloth seller.

Options:
ক. উক্ত বাক্যগুলোকে সঠিক ক্রমানুসারে সাজান।
খ. এই ঘটনার প্রধান নৈতিক শিক্ষা কী লিখুন।
গ. ক্রমানুসারের কোন ধাপটিকে টার্নিং পয়েন্ট (ঘটনার মোচড়) বলা যায়? ব্যাখ্যাসহ নির্দিষ্ট বাক্যের লেবেল দিন।
ঘ. বাক্য (h)-এর সরাসরি কথাকে reported speech-এ রূপান্তর করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: (d) → (f) → (b) → (i) → (e) → (g) → (a) → (h) → (c)

খ উত্তর: প্রধান নৈতিক শিক্ষা — অসাধু বা মিথ্যাবাদী ব্যক্তির অদৃশ্য অপকারের স্বস্তি কেবল সাময়িক; মিথ্যা বললে শাস্তি বা আপত্তিজনক প্রতিফলন হতে পারে। সততা রাখাই দীর্ঘস্থায়ী সম্মানের পথ।

গ উত্তর: টার্নিং পয়েন্ট হলো বাক্য (e) — "The cloth seller said, 'I am going to the market tomorrow. Please send your daughter with me to help carry the bundles.'" কারণ এই প্রস্তাবের পরে-tailor-এর মিথ্যা ছদ্মবেশ (মেয়ের অনুপস্থিতি) প্রকাশ পায় এবং ঘটনার মূল সংঘাত শুরু হয়।

ঘ উত্তর: Reported speech: The cloth seller said that a gust of wind had carried his daughter away.



Explanation:
Solution explanation:

ক (sequence) — We begin with (d) because it sets the scene: the tailor borrows the measuring tape. Next (f) follows naturally when the owner asks for it back. The tailor offers (b) the excuse that moths ate the tape. The cloth seller's anger is described in (i). To test or expose the tailor, the cloth seller (e) asks that his daughter accompany him to the market. The tailor agrees and (g) the daughter goes but returns alone. The cloth seller (a) asks about her, and the tailor answers (h). Finally the cloth seller's comeback (c) and the implied irony conclude the story.

খ (moral) — The story is a classic example showing that unfair or dishonest behavior (here the tailor's false excuse) is often met with a clever retort that exposes the falsity; honesty is the better policy.

গ (turning point) — Sentence (e) is the turning point because until then the conflict was limited to a broken/lost object and an excuse. Inviting the daughter to accompany the seller creates a situation where the tailor's earlier lie can be tested and thus escalates the narrative.

ঘ (reported speech) — In converting direct speech to reported speech we shift tense and remove quotation marks; "A gust of wind carried your daughter away," becomes: The cloth seller said that a gust of wind had carried his daughter away.

Question:
Arrange the jumbled sentences into a meaningful order to reveal the full incident.

(a) "How could a whale swallow that net?" the neighbour exclaimed.

(b) One evening a neighbour borrowed a fishing net from a fisherman.

(c) The neighbour later borrowed the fisherman's small boat and asked to take the fisherman's son along to help row.

(d) "The sea swallowed your net," said the neighbour when the fisherman asked for it back.

(e) After the trip the boat came back with the neighbour alone and the fisherman's son was missing.

(f) The fisherman was startled and asked, "Where is my son?"

(g) "A whale must have swallowed your son," said the neighbour.

(h) The fisherman's suspicion at first turned to anger, but then he calmly replied, "If the sea can swallow your net, perhaps a whale could have taken my son."

(i) A few days later the fisherman asked the neighbour to return the fishing net.

Options:
ক. বাক্যগুলোকে ক্রমানুসারে সাজান।
খ. কথ্যটিতে কার কৌতুকপূর্ণ প্রতিক্রিয়া প্রকৃত অপভাষাকে কীভাবে প্রকাশ করে তা ব্যাখ্যা করুন।
গ. বাক্য (h)-এ fisherman's calm reply-এর উদ্দেশ্য কী? সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা দিন।
ঘ. বক্তার উদ্দেশ্য ধরে নৈতিক শিক্ষা সংক্ষেপে লিখুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: (b) → (i) → (d) → (a) → (c) → (e) → (f) → (g) → (h)

খ উত্তর: কৌতুকপূর্ণ প্রতিক্রিয়া (নাবিকের বা fisherman's calm reply) আসলে সমানভাবে মিথ্যার জবাব; neighbour-মধ্যের "sea swallowed your net" ও পরবর্তীতে "a whale swallowed your son"—এই অদ্ভুত অজুহাতগুলোকে সমান করে দেখিয়ে fisherman নিজের ছেলের অনুপস্থিতি নিয়ে একই রকম বিস্ময় প্রয়োগ করে, ফলে মিথ্যার কৌতুক প্রকাশ পায়।

গ উত্তর: বাক্য (h)-এ fisherman's calm reply-এর উদ্দেশ্য ছিল মিথ্যাকে আয়নার মতো প্রতিফলিত করে দেখানো—অর্থাৎ তিনি neighbour-এর অযৌক্তিক অজুহাতটাকে একই তালে ফিরিয়ে দিলেন, ফলে neighbour-কে বিব্রত বা নিজের কথার অমার্জনীয়তা উপলব্ধ করানো।

ঘ উত্তর: নৈতিক শিক্ষা — মিথ্যা অজুহাত দেয়া সহজ, কিন্তু মিথ্যেকে মোকাবিলা করার জন্য চরম কৌতুক বা বিনয়ের ব্যবহার মিথ্যাবাজকে গ্লানি করতে পারে; সততা ও স্বচ্ছতা শ্রেয়।

Explanation:
Solution explanation:

ক (sequence) — (b) introduces the loan of the net. (i) follows when the owner asks for it back. The neighbour's strange excuse appears in (d). The fisherman's surprised retort (a) occurs then the neighbour asks to borrow the boat and the son in (c). After the trip the son is missing (e), prompting the fisherman to ask (f). The neighbour gives another far-fetched excuse (g) and the fisherman finally answers calmly in (h), reflecting the neighbour's earlier absurdity.

খ — The story uses irony and role-reversal to ridicule the liar's excuses; the fisherman answering in the same illogical mode highlights how untenable the neighbour's lies are.

গ — The calmness in (h) is strategic: by matching the neighbour's absurdity rather than reacting with heat, the fisherman exposes the lie more effectively.

ঘ — The moral reiterates that dishonesty invites embarrassment; speaking truthfully is socially and ethically better.

Question:
The sentences below are out of order. Put them in the correct sequence so the short tale reads sensibly.

(a) The gardener asked politely, "Can I have back my watering can?"

(b) After a while the gardener went to fetch his watering can which he had lent to the nursery owner.

(c) "Rust ate the hole in your can; I cannot return it," the nursery owner said.

(d) "Who would steal my apprentice?" cried the gardener.

(e) The gardener had lent his old but faithful watering can to a nearby nursery owner.

(f) The gardener sent his young apprentice to the nursery to help carry some plant pots, but the apprentice returned alone.

(g) The nursery owner replied, "A thief must have taken your apprentice."

(h) The gardener listened quietly to the nursery owner's excuses and then gave him a pointed reply: "Just as rust can eat a can, strange things can happen to people too."

Options:
ক. বাক্যগুলো সঠিক ক্রমে সাজান।
খ. বাক্য (h)-এর কথাটি কি নির্দেশ করে? সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা দিন।
গ. এই কাহিনীর প্রকারভেদের উপর ভিত্তি করে একটি উপযুক্ত শিরোনাম ব্যাখ্যাসহ দিন।
ঘ. বাক্য (c) কে reported speech-এ রূপান্তর করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: (e) → (b) → (c) → (h) → (f) → (a) → (g) → (d)

খ উত্তর: বাক্য (h) নির্দেশ করে যে gardener-টি nursery owner-এর অজুহাতকে একই যুক্তিহীন মানদণ্ডে ফিরিয়ে দিয়েছে—এটি একটি ছলনাপূর্ণ বা ব্যঙ্গাত্মক প্রতিক্রিয়া যা মিথ্যার টোকা করে। তিনি শান্ত স্বরে তর্ক করে দেখিয়েছেন যে অযৌক্তিক অজুহাত মেনে নেওয়া যায় না।

গ উত্তর: উপযুক্ত শিরোনাম: "অজুহাত ও প্রতিবাদ" — কারণ গল্পটি একটি উপকরণের ক্ষতি সংক্রান্ত অসত্য অজুহাত এবং তার বিরুদ্ধে সুশৃঙ্খল, তীক্ষ্ণ প্রতিক্রিয়ার মাধ্যমে ন্যায় বা বিবেচনার দাবি তুলে ধরে।

ঘ উত্তর: Reported speech: The nursery owner said that rust had eaten a hole in the can and that he could not return it.



Explanation:
Solution explanation:

ক (sequence) — (e) sets the scene with the lending. (b) follows as the gardener later goes to fetch it. The nursery owner's excuse is (c). The gardener's pointed, ironic reply is (h), which underscores the absurdity of the excuse. Then (f) shows the apprentice being sent and returning alone, prompting the gardener's direct question (a). The nursery owner offers another excuse in (g), and finally the gardener's exasperated cry appears in (d).

খ — Sentence (h) is a rhetorical rejoinder: the gardener is not literally saying rust can harm people, but is using analogy to show the nursery owner's excuse is as implausible as claiming a person could vanish because of the same force. It's a moral rebuttal.

গ — The title "অজুহাত ও প্রতিবাদ" (Excuse and Rebuttal) captures the central conflict: an implausible excuse about an object and the measured, ironic response that reveals the lie.

ঘ — In reported speech we shift present tense to past: direct "Rust ate the hole in your can; I cannot return it," becomes: The nursery owner said that rust had eaten a hole in the can and that he could not return it.

Question:
The COVID era altered many routines: people were compelled to change daily behaviors. Households started to (ক)_____ long-standing habits, many commuters preferred (খ)_____ instead of crowded public transport, communities emphasized (গ)_____ to protect the vulnerable, and everyone began to realize the (ঘ)_____ of collective responsibility for health.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (ক)
খ. Fill the blank (খ)
গ. Fill the blank (গ)
ঘ. Fill the blank (ঘ)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক adopt new habits — Households had to adopt or modify habits (like frequent cleaning and handwashing) to reduce transmission. 

খ private transport / cycling / walking — Many commuters shifted to private transport, cycling, or walking to avoid crowded buses and trains; any of these options fit depending on context, but "private transport" is concise. 

গ social distancing / hygiene practices — Communities emphasized social distancing and improved hygiene (mask-wearing, sanitizing) to protect high-risk groups. 

ঘ importance / value — The crisis revealed the importance (or value) of collective responsibility and public health measures; either word conveys the intended meaning.

Explanation:
Each blank asks for a concise noun or verb phrase describing behavioral shifts during the pandemic. For (ক) a verb like "adopt" or "modify" fits because people changed habits. For (খ) a mode of transport that reduces contact works; "private transport" is broad and correct. For (গ) the phrase should name the protective measures — "social distancing" or "hygiene practices". For (ঘ) the blank needs an abstract noun conveying significance — "importance" or "value" — since the sentence points to a lesson learned about communal health.

Schools and workplaces redesigned routines to stay safe: campuses tightened (ক)_____ checks at entrances, staff and students kept (খ)_____ and used sanitizers regularly, online tools were (গ)_____ to continue teaching and meetings, and authorities stressed the (ঘ)_____ of mental as well as physical wellbeing.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (ক)
খ. Fill the blank (খ)
গ. Fill the blank (গ)
ঘ. Fill the blank (ঘ)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক health / screening — "health checks" or "screening checks" (temperature and symptom screening) is appropriate because institutions screened entrants to prevent infections. 

খ masks / face coverings — "masks" or "face coverings" is the direct, correct practice for reducing airborne spread. 

গ adopted / deployed — "adopted" or "deployed" fits: schools and workplaces adopted online platforms and tools to continue activities remotely. 

ঘ importance / significance — The blank requires a noun reflecting emphasis; "importance" or "significance" of mental and physical wellbeing conveys that both were prioritized.

Explanation:
The sentence lists institutional responses. (ক) should denote practical entry controls: "health checks" or "screening". (খ) clearly refers to protective equipment: "masks". (গ) asks for a verb meaning to start using technology broadly — "adopted" or "deployed". (ঘ) needs an abstract noun summarizing the lesson that mental health matters as much as physical health: "importance" or "significance" are correct and natural choices.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (ক)
খ. Fill the blank (খ)
গ. Fill the blank (গ)
ঘ. Fill the blank (ঘ)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক open / green — "open spaces" or "green spaces" are prioritized to allow safer outdoor activities and better ventilation in public areas. 

খ staggered / flexible — "staggered" or "flexible" schedules (e.g., flexible work hours or shifts) reduce peak overcrowding. 

গ build / achieve — "build immunity" or "achieve herd immunity" are phrases used in public-health contexts; "build" is general and acceptable here. 

ঘ necessity / value — "necessity" or "importance" of preparedness underscores learning that planning and readiness are essential for future emergencies.

Explanation:
This context focuses on long-term adjustments. (ক) requires the type of public space emphasized — "open" or "green" spaces provide safer environments. (খ) needs an adjective describing schedule changes to avoid crowding; "staggered" or "flexible" are commonly used. (গ) is about increasing population-level protection; verbs like "build" or phrases like "achieve herd immunity" fit depending on specificity. (ঘ) calls for an abstract noun highlighting the lesson: "necessity" or "importance" of preparedness.

খ. Fill blank (b): choose the appropriate modal verb (may/can/is)
গ. Fill blank (c): choose an appropriate verb (provides/acts/serves) or phrase
ঘ. Fill blank (d): complete the phrase (to discover/to imagine/to create)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক faculty / ability
খ can / may
গ provides / acts as the
ঘ to create / to discover

Explanation:
ক: Both “faculty” and “ability” are suitable because they mean a mental power or capacity — imagination is a mental faculty that enables visualization of things not present. খ: “can” or “may” are correct modals here because they express potential: imagination can/may be cultivated; “is” would state it as a fact rather than possibility. গ: Verbs like “provides,” “acts as,” or the phrase “serves as the” fit: imagination provides (or acts as) the spark for breakthroughs. ঘ: Phrases such as “to create” or “to discover” complete the sense that imagination helps produce new possibilities; either gerund/infinitive works depending on style. The choices are interchangeable where synonyms are offered; the explanations clarify grammatical role and nuance of modality and noun selection.

Question:
Sleep includes several distinct stages. REM sleep is the stage (a) ______ vivid dreaming often happens. REM periods (b) ______ several times during a normal night's sleep, becoming longer toward morning. Insufficient REM sleep (c) ______ memory consolidation and emotional regulation. Therefore, consistent restorative sleep (d) ______ important for learning and mental health.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a): a linking phrase (when/during which/where)
খ. Fill blank (b): choose a verb that shows repetition (occurs/recur/happen)
গ. Fill blank (c): choose the correct modal or verb phrase (may/does/can impair)
ঘ. Fill blank (d): choose the correct verb (is/remains/turns)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক during which / when
খ recur / occur
গ can impair / may impair
ঘ is / remains

Explanation:
ক: “during which” or “when” correctly links REM sleep to the occurrence of vivid dreams; “where” would be less precise for a temporal stage. খ: “recur” or “occur” both indicate repetition across the night — REM periods recur multiple times. গ: “can impair” or “may impair” conveys possibility that lack of REM negatively affects memory consolidation; using a modal is appropriate because the effect can vary among individuals. ঘ: “is” or “remains” fits naturally: consistent restorative sleep is important (simple present states the general truth). The chosen words preserve grammatical correctness and the intended scientific nuance about sleep stages and cognitive effects.

Question:
Nightmares are emotionally intense dreams that often feel threatening. A nightmare (a) ______ terrifying enough to wake a person suddenly. After waking (b) ______, many people feel scared or unsettled. If nightmares become frequent they can (c) ______ the overall quality of sleep and daytime performance. Clinicians sometimes (d) ______ techniques such as imagery rehearsal or controlled exposure to reduce nightmare frequency.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a): choose the correct verb form (is/are/feel)
খ. Fill blank (b): complete the phrase (up/from/around)
গ. Fill blank (c): choose the verb that fits (impair/interrupt/enhance)
ঘ. Fill blank (d): choose the verb (use/apply/recommend)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক is
খ up / from (wake up from)
গ impair / disrupt
ঘ use / apply / recommend

Explanation:
ক: “Nightmare” is singular so the correct verb is “is.” “Feel” would change the sentence structure and require a different construction (e.g., “that feel terrifying”). খ: The common collocation is “wake up from a nightmare,” so “up” completes the phrasal verb and “from” indicates source. গ: Frequent nightmares tend to harm sleep and daytime functioning — verbs like “impair” or “disrupt” capture that negative effect; “enhance” would be incorrect. ঘ: Clinicians may “use,” “apply,” or “recommend” specific therapeutic techniques; each verb works depending on nuance (direct application versus suggestion). The explanations show grammatical agreement (singular/plural), correct phrasal verbs, and appropriate semantic choices for clinical context.

(d) 'plan' (or 'map out') their routes is the intended result of consulting and interacting.

খ: (a) 'in' is the correct preposition: signs are 'displayed in several languages'. (b) 'find' is used with 'directions' — passengers 'find directions' easily. (c) 'avoid' completes the idea: multilingual signage helps people avoid confusion.

Solution:
ক (a) aesthetic; (b) cultivate
খ (c) refine; (d) heritage
গ (e) innovate; (f) critique
ঘ (g) discourse; (h) transcend

Explanation:
ক (a) aesthetic — 'aesthetic appreciation' is the standard collocation meaning appreciation of beauty; (b) cultivate — we 'cultivate' tastes or sensitivity, so 'cultivate beauty' (or cultivate an appreciation for beauty) fits.
খ (c) refine — art 'refines' sensibility by polishing taste and judgment; (d) heritage — museums preserve cultural 'heritage', the correct noun for traditions and artifacts.
গ (e) innovate — contemporary creators 'innovate' by blending old and new; (f) critique — 'critical critique' or 'critical feedback' strengthens artists; 'critique' is the best fit from the bank.
ঘ (g) discourse — public 'discourse' is the exchange of ideas; (h) transcend — art and discourse can 'transcend' borders, meaning go beyond them.
Overall these choices match common collocations and the intended meanings of the sentence: aesthetic appreciation, cultivate sensibility, refine sensibility, preserve heritage, innovate creatively, critique (as critical evaluation), public discourse, and transcend borders.

ঘ (g) skepticism; (h) theory

Explanation:
ক (a) hypothesis — scientists typically start with a testable 'hypothesis'; (b) experiment — an 'experiment' is designed to test that hypothesis.

Question:
Steady effort combined with thoughtful planning is often the path to achievement. A person who (a) without a plan may (b) valuable hours. Those who (c) their tasks clearly and (d) even when progress is slow usually reach their aims.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a).
খ. Fill blank (b).
গ. Fill blank (c).
ঘ. Fill blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক acts
খ waste
গ prioritize
ঘ persevere

Explanation:
ক (acts): The clause reads "A person who (a) without a plan..." The verb "acts" (or "acts" + without a plan) correctly completes the sentence to mean someone who takes action without planning.

খ (waste): "may (b) valuable hours" — the verb that fits naturally is "waste." It conveys losing time because of lack of planning.

গ (prioritize): "Those who (c) their tasks clearly" — "prioritize" fits best: to set tasks in order of importance, matching the meaning of clear task-setting.

ঘ (persevere): "and (d) even when progress is slow" — "persevere" (continue steadily) completes the idea of persisting despite slow progress and logically leads to reaching aims.

ঘ. ভর্তি (f)-এর জন্য একটি উপযুক্ত ক্রিয়া বা বাক্যবিন্যাস দিন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) dissolved / collapsed; (b) redrew / appeared on

খ (c) intensified alliances and deepened rivalries

গ (d) found / found applications in both civilian and military fields (or "had both civilian and military applications"); (e) precipitated / caused long-lasting humanitarian crises

ঘ (f) accelerated / became more rapid due to improved travel and global media

Explanation:
ক: Empires "dissolving" or "collapsing" is standard when they lose control; new nations "appearing on" or "redrawing" the map describes emergence and border changes.

খ: (c) needs a phrase showing how the Cold War affected international relations. "Intensified alliances and deepened rivalries" succinctly conveys both strengthening of blocs and increased hostility.

গ: (d) requires a wording that indicates dual-purpose technology—"had both civilian and military applications" or "found applications in both...". For (e), verbs like "precipitated" or "caused" clearly link conflicts to humanitarian crises.

ঘ: (f) is about speed of cultural exchange: "accelerated" or "became more rapid" are appropriate verbs; adding "due to improved travel and global media" explains the mechanism.

Question:
Forests act as the planet's lungs. They (a) — carbon dioxide and store carbon, help (b) — biodiversity, and (c) — against soil erosion and flooding. When large areas are (d) — for timber or agriculture, regional climates, water cycles and species survival are all affected.

Options:
ক. (a) —
খ. (b) —
গ. (c) —
ঘ. (d) —


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক absorb / sequester
খ support / maintain
গ protect / prevent
ঘ cleared / deforested / removed

Explanation:
ক (a): Forests take in atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store carbon in biomass and soils. Both 'absorb' and 'sequester' accurately describe this function.

খ (b): Forests provide habitat and ecological niches for many species; verbs like 'support' or 'maintain' biodiversity fit because they indicate sustaining species richness.

গ (c): One of the ecosystem services of forests is stabilizing soil and reducing surface runoff, so 'protect' or 'prevent' (as in 'prevent erosion') are appropriate.

ঘ (d): When trees are removed the typical verbs are 'cleared', 'deforested' or 'removed'. These convey the human-driven loss of forest cover and match the harmful activities described (timber, agriculture).

Question:
In Amsterdam, cycling is an everyday mode of travel. The city has invested heavily in segregated bike lanes, clear signage and rental systems. Local rules require lights at night and impose fines for reckless riding. As a result, many consider Amsterdam one of the models for urban cycling safety.

Options:
ক. Cycling infrastructure in Amsterdam is considered one of the (____) in the world.
খ. Cyclists must use lights after dusk; this rule is (____) by local ordinances.
গ. Rental bikes are usually (____) with front and rear lights and bells.
ঘ. Police and traffic wardens are (____) in ensuring compliance on busy routes.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক safest
খ mandated
গ equipped
ঘ vigilant

Explanation:
ক — 'safest' fits because the sentence compares Amsterdam's cycling infrastructure to others and asserts it ranks among the top in safety. 'Safe' would be an adjective but the superlative 'safest' matches 'one of the'.

খ — 'mandated' means legally required; local ordinances mandate the use of lights. Alternatives like 'required' or 'enforced' could work, but 'mandated' emphasizes a legal obligation.

গ — 'equipped' is used with 'with' to indicate that rental bikes come supplied with lights and bells. Other verbs like 'fitted' or 'provided' are possible, but 'equipped' is the most natural collocation here.

ঘ — 'vigilant' describes an attentive, watchful attitude appropriate for police and wardens tasked with ensuring compliance. Words like 'active' or 'diligent' are also plausible, but 'vigilant' conveys alert enforcement.

ঘ. To deter crime and manage crowds, many stations are (____) with CCTV and staff patrols.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক punctuality
খ reinforced
গ reserved
ঘ monitored

Explanation:
ক — 'punctuality' is the noun that describes arriving and departing on schedule; it succinctly captures the trains' reputation.

খ — 'reinforced' indicates that signage strengthens or supports the behavioural expectations set by announcements and codes. It implies repeated reminders and visible cues.

গ — 'reserved' is commonly used for seats set aside for certain groups (e.g., 'reserved seating'); it indicates those seats are designated for elderly/disabled passengers.

ঘ — 'monitored' means observed or watched, typically by cameras and staff; it's the appropriate verb to describe stations under surveillance to deter crime and manage safety.

Question:
Australia's civil aviation framework emphasizes passenger safety through regulation, regular inspections and clear in-flight procedures. Airlines must provide safety information, ensure that equipment is maintained and enforce seatbelt rules — particularly for young children.

Options:
ক. Before takeoff, passengers receive a safety (____) that demonstrates emergency procedures.
খ. Aircraft are subject to routine maintenance checks (____) by aviation authorities.
গ. Children under two are sometimes required to be (____) in approved child restraints during takeoff and landing.
ঘ. Civil aviation regulators in Australia are known to be (____), which helps sustain a high safety record.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক briefing
খ inspected
গ secured
ঘ stringent

Explanation:
ক — 'briefing' is the standard term for the pre-flight safety presentation or demonstration given to passengers.

খ — 'inspected' indicates that aviation authorities carry out checks on aircraft; 'inspected' highlights the active checking process. Alternatives like 'conducted' (as in 'checks are conducted') are possible, but 'inspected' directly describes the action on aircraft.

গ — 'secured' conveys that children are fastened or restrained safely in approved devices. It pairs naturally with 'in approved child restraints.'

ঘ — 'stringent' describes strict, rigorous regulation and oversight. Calling regulators 'stringent' explains why safety standards are high; synonyms could include 'rigorous' or 'strict', but 'stringent' is a precise, formal fit for regulatory contexts.

Urban planners warn that seawalls and natural buffers must be (c)_____ if communities are to be protected; otherwise, low‑lying districts will be (d)_____ by more frequent inundation.

Options:
ক. Fill (a): a noun or gerund meaning 'the process of glaciers losing ice' (one word)
খ. Fill (b): a verb phrase that links cause to effect (e.g., 'result in' / 'lead to')
গ. Fill (c): an adjective meaning 'made stronger or improved' (one word)
ঘ. Fill (d): an adjective meaning 'affected by flooding' (one word)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক melting
খ are raising
গ strengthened
ঘ inundated

Explanation:
ক: 'melting' is the gerund/noun that describes glaciers losing ice, and it fits grammatically before 'of glaciers'.
খ: 'are raising' correctly links the processes (melting and thermal expansion) to their effect on sea levels in the present progressive sense that these processes are happening now. Alternatives like 'are causing' or 'are driving' would also be acceptable depending on nuance.
গ: 'strengthened' is the past participle used as an adjective to mean 'made stronger or reinforced'—appropriate for describing seawalls and buffers.
ঘ: 'inundated' is the conventional adjective meaning 'flooded' and matches the context of districts being overwhelmed by water. Together the chosen words produce a natural, grammatically coherent sentence describing ongoing coastal risk and required responses.

ঘ. Fill (d): a verb meaning 'provide or create' (plural or base form appropriate for 'incentives')


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক exceed
খ is associated with
গ increase
ঘ offer

Explanation:
ক: 'exceed' is the correct present‑tense verb meaning 'go beyond' the recommended safe limits; it fits the subject 'concentrations'.
খ: 'is associated with' is a common, scientifically cautious phrase linking exposure to health outcomes; alternatives like 'increase' or 'raise' the risk would be stronger but 'is associated with' is accurate for epidemiological findings.
গ: 'increase' as a verb (e.g., 'increase investment') correctly expresses allocating more funds toward clean transit.
ঘ: 'offer' fits with 'incentives'—governments 'offer incentives' is the standard collocation. 'Provide' would also work. The chosen words make the paragraph clear, grammatically sound, and appropriate for policy discussion.

খ. Fill (b): an adverb or phrase meaning 'especially' or 'more than others' (one or two words)
গ. Fill (c): a verb in imperative or infinitive form meaning 'create or restore' (one word)
ঘ. Fill (d): a verb meaning 'limit or phase out' (base form)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক threatens
খ are especially
গ restore
ঘ restrict

Explanation:
ক: 'threatens' suits the singular subject 'Loss of habitat and pesticide exposure' when treated as a collective cause; it conveys the danger to pollination services.
খ: 'are especially' indicates that smallholders are more vulnerable compared with others; depending on style 'are particularly' or simply 'particularly' could be used.
গ: 'restore' is an appropriate verb for actions like recreating wildflower strips and hedgerows that support pollinators; 'create' or 'establish' are alternatives.
ঘ: 'restrict' accurately expresses limiting the use of broad‑spectrum insecticides; 'phase out' or 'limit' would also be correct. The choices produce a clear, policy‑oriented paragraph on supporting pollinators and protecting crops.
