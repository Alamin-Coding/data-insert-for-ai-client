গ (e) innovate; (f) critique
ঘ (g) discourse; (h) transcend

Explanation:
ক (a) aesthetic — 'aesthetic appreciation' is the standard collocation meaning appreciation of beauty; (b) cultivate — we 'cultivate' tastes or sensitivity, so 'cultivate beauty' (or cultivate an appreciation for beauty) fits.
খ (c) refine — art 'refines' sensibility by polishing taste and judgment; (d) heritage — museums preserve cultural 'heritage', the correct noun for traditions and artifacts.
গ (e) innovate — contemporary creators 'innovate' by blending old and new; (f) critique — 'critical critique' or 'critical feedback' strengthens artists; 'critique' is the best fit from the bank.
ঘ (g) discourse — public 'discourse' is the exchange of ideas; (h) transcend — art and discourse can 'transcend' borders, meaning go beyond them.
Overall these choices match common collocations and the intended meanings of the sentence: aesthetic appreciation, cultivate sensibility, refine sensibility, preserve heritage, innovate creatively, critique (as critical evaluation), public discourse, and transcend borders.

Careful (c) — and (d) — recording of data make it possible for others to (e) — findings by attempting to (f) — the same procedures.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (a) hypothesis; (b) experiment
খ (c) observation; (d) methodical
গ (e) verify; (f) replicate
ঘ (g) skepticism; (h) theory

Explanation:
ক (a) hypothesis — scientists typically start with a testable 'hypothesis'; (b) experiment — an 'experiment' is designed to test that hypothesis.
খ (c) observation — careful 'observation' is fundamental to collecting data; (d) methodical — data must be recorded in a 'methodical' (systematic) way so others can interpret it.
গ (e) verify — peers 'verify' results to check their validity; (f) replicate — to confirm findings others attempt to 'replicate' the experiment (repeat it under similar conditions).
ঘ (g) skepticism — scientific 'skepticism' prevents accepting claims without evidence; (h) theory — after repeated confirmation and integration of facts, a 'theory' may form that explains patterns.
These words follow the scientific method: hypothesis → experiment → observation → systematic recording → verification and replication → skepticism and theory-building.
