Solution:
[math](g)\rightarrow(c)\rightarrow (d)\rightarrow (b)\rightarrow (e)\rightarrow (f)\rightarrow (h)\rightarrow (a)[/math]Kazi Nazrul Islam was born in 1899 in the district of Burdwan in West Bengal. He lost his father at the age of eight and at the age of eleven he showed his poetic genius. At the age of nineteen, he joined the army as an ordinary soldier but after the First World War, he gave up the sword for the pen. He wrote a lot of poems, songs, ghazals, short stories, novels, etc. It was tragic that he had been suffering from a cruel disease since 1942 and remained paralyzed for the rest of his life. Bangladesh became independent in 1971 and he was brought to Bangladesh from Kolkata in 1972. Then he was declared our national poet by the government of Bangladesh. He died on August 29, 1976 and was buried in the compound of Dhaka University.

Explanation:
The correct order is chronological: (g) birth, (c) childhood loss and early poetic talent, (d) army service and turn to writing, (b) prolific literary output, (e) illness from 1942, (f) return to Bangladesh after 1971, (h) declaration as national poet, and (a) death and burial in 1976. This sequence is right because it follows Nazrul’s life events in time and each statement logically follows from the previous one as parts of his biography.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math](v)\rightarrow(i)\rightarrow(ix) \rightarrow(iv) \rightarrow(x) \rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(viii) \rightarrow(iii) \rightarrow(vi) \rightarrow(vii)[/math]Once upon a time, there lived a fox in a forest. One day he was very hungry. He searched food everywhere but he did not get any food. At last he entered into a vineyard. There were ripe grapes hanging up on the vine. The grapes were too high for him to reach. He took a run and jumped to reach the bunch of grapes but could not reach it. Again and again he jumped. But each time, he failed to reach the grapes. At last being tired, he went away saying that the grapes were sour.

Explanation:
Explanation:
The correct chronological order is: (v) → (i) → (ix) → (iv) → (x) → (ii) → (viii) → (iii) → (vi) → (vii).  
This order is right because it follows a clear story sequence—introducing the fox, showing his hunger and search, placing him in the vineyard where he sees the high grapes, describing his repeated attempts and failures, and ending with his tired resignation.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math](iii)\rightarrow(vii)\rightarrow(iv) \rightarrow(vi) \rightarrow(v) \rightarrow(x) \rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(viii) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(ix)[/math]Hercules, a Greek mythical hero, was the son of Jupiter and Alcmena. His cousin Eurestheus, the king of Mycenae, made him undergo some difficult tasks. These huge tasks in Greek myths are called 'The Twelve Labours of Hercules'. One of the tasks was to slay a monster called Hydra that was ravaging the country of Argos. It had nine heads of which the middle one was said to be immortal. Initially, Hercules started striking off its heads with his club. Strangely enough, whenever Hercules knocked off a head of Hydra, two new ones erupted in its place. Eventually, with the help of Iolaus, his devoted servant, Hercules succeeded in burning all the heads except the ninth. Still challenge remained with the immortal one. However, with much effort, he buried the immortal head under a huge rock and completed the task successfully.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct logical sequence is (iii) → (vii) → (iv) → (vi) → (v) → (x) → (ii) → (i) → (viii) → (ix) because it first introduces Hercules and why he must do tasks, names those tasks, identifies the specific labour (slaying the Hydra) and describes the monster, then shows his initial action (striking) and the resulting problem (two heads growing), notes the remaining immortal head, and finally gives the solution (Iolaus burning the heads and Hercules burying the immortal head). This order follows a clear chronological and cause–effect flow, so each sentence naturally leads to the next.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math](e)\rightarrow(a)\rightarrow(d) \rightarrow(b) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(c) \rightarrow(g) \rightarrow(h) \rightarrow(j) \rightarrow(f)[/math]Once there was a king. The king was fond of knowing his future from the astrologer. A good astrologer visited the capital of the king. The king called him to the palace. The astrologer told something very unpleasant. At this the king got furious and condemned him to death. But another thought crossed his mind before the astrologer was removed for execution. The king then asked, "How long would you like to live?" He then thought for a while some ways to escape With ready wit he said, "The stars declare that I'll die only a week before your death".

Explanation:
Correct order: (e) → (a) → (d) → (b) → (i) → (c) → (g) → (h) → (f) → (j).  
Explanation: The sequence begins by introducing the king and his habit of consulting astrologers, then describes an astrologer’s arrival and summons to the palace, followed by his unpleasant prediction and the king’s angry sentence. Before execution the king hesitates, asks how long the astrologer wishes to live, the astrologer gives the clever reply, and finally the king (or astrologer) considers ways to escape—so each sentence logically follows the previous one.

Solution:
[math](iv)\rightarrow(i)\rightarrow(ix) \rightarrow(iii) \rightarrow(vii) \rightarrow(x) \rightarrow(viii) \rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(v) \rightarrow(vi)[/math]An English poet was staying in Italy for the benefit of his health. During his stay he received an unpaid letter from his friend, which contained nothing but some words. The poet had to pay double postage, so, he became very annoyed. He wanted to teach his friend a good lesson. So, he procured a heavy stone and packed it up in a fine box. Then he sent it to his friend with the words on it "Carriage to be paid on delivery." His friend thought that the contents of the parcel were valuable, so, he paid the heavy charge for carrying. With a great hope in mind, he opened the box. To his utter surprise, he found nothing but an ordinary stone. Thus the poet taught his friend a good lesson.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct order follows a clear cause–effect story: (iv) sets the scene, (i) describes the unpaid letter that angers him, (iii) gives his motive, (vii) and (x) show his action of sending a heavy stone marked “Carriage to be paid on delivery,” (viii), (ii) and (v) describe the friend paying, opening the box and finding a stone, (vi) states the moral, and (ix) is the final ironic twist that the poet had to pay double postage. Use of connectors like “so,” “then,” “thus,” and the logical sequence of motive → action → reaction → result guide this ordering.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math](c)\rightarrow(f)\rightarrow(h) \rightarrow(a) \rightarrow(d) \rightarrow(g) \rightarrow(b) \rightarrow(j) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(e)[/math]Dr. Qudrat-i-Khuda was born on 8th May at village Maragra in the district of Birbhum in West Bengal in 1900 AD. His father Hazrat Shah Abdul Mukit was a pious man. At the age of six, he was admitted into a Furkania Madrasa and then he was admitted into an English School. He showed extraordinary credit in every examination of the school. In 1925, getting star marks he passed M.Sc in Chemistry from Kolkata Presidency College.

He made a great plan to give the new structure of education system. He died on 3rd November in 1977.

Explanation:
Correct sentences are (f), (h) and (j). (f) is correct because it uses a simple past statement with a clear subject and predicate. (h) is acceptable because the time phrase "At the age of six" plus the passive "was admitted" correctly shows when and what happened, and (j) correctly uses "was appointed" + position to state an official appointment.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math](iii)\rightarrow(ix)\rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(vi) \rightarrow(vii) \rightarrow(iv) \rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(x) \rightarrow(v) \rightarrow(viii)[/math]Once a gold necklace was lost from a rich man's house. Naturally it was suspected that one of the servants had stolen the necklace. All the servants were called and interrogated. But nobody confessed their guilt. So the owner of the house lodged a complaint in the court. The servants were summoned to the court but they denied having stolen the necklace. In order to find out the thief, the judge chalked out an intelligent plan. He gave each of the suspects a stick of equal length and said that one of the sticks would increase by an inch the next day. When the servants came to the court the next day, the thief had already cut off an inch of his stick. The judge found one of the sticks shorter than the others and in this way he could easily catch the thief.

Explanation:
The correct order follows the chronological cause–effect: first the necklace is lost ([iii]) and the owner complains in court ([vii]), so servants are suspected ([ix]) and summoned/interrogated ([i], [iv]); the judge then plans and tests them ([ii] → [x]), nobody confesses ([vi]), the guilty servant trims his stick to hide the change ([v]), and the judge finds the shorter stick and catches the thief ([viii]). This order is right because the linking words and pronouns (e.g. "he" = judge) and the sequence of actions (loss → complaint → suspicion → test → concealment → discovery) logically connect each sentence.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math](f)\rightarrow(e)\rightarrow (g)\rightarrow (b)\rightarrow (h)\rightarrow (d)\rightarrow (a)\rightarrow (c)[/math]Haji Mohsin helped the poor and the helpless people with food and clothes. He was famous for his kindness. A thief entered into his bedroom one night. Haji Mohsin woke up and caught hold of the thief. The man said, "Sir, I am very poor, I have no food in my house." He took pity with the poor man. Haji Mohsin took him to another room and opened a box. The box was full of gold and money.

Explanation:
The correct order is (e) → (f) → (g) → (b) → (h) → (d) → (a) → (c) because the paragraph starts with Haji Mohsin’s reputation for kindness, gives an example of his help, then narrates the night incident (thief enters, Haji wakes and catches him), the thief’s plea, Haji’s pity, and finally Haji taking him to a room and opening a box that is full of gold and money — a clear chronological and cause‑and‑effect sequence.

On the 10th November 1863, a railway train was carrying him to a place called Gettysburg. He was going there to speak at a meeting. In the train, he was busy with writing something. He was not writing on a paper, but on the back of an envelope. On the envelope, it was what he was going to say at the meeting. The last words of the speech are: "Government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth." These words tell us what the best possible way of ruling a country is. In fact, the speech on the envelope is now famous as "Gettysburg Address". It is one of the finest and shortest speeches in English language.

Explanation:
Explanation: Statement (iii) is incorrect — the Gettysburg Address was delivered on November 19, 1863 (Lincoln traveled to Gettysburg around November 18–19), not on November 10. The other statements are correct: Lincoln was U.S. President, the Address is a short, famous speech often noted to have been drafted on the back of an envelope while he rode by train, and its closing line affirms democratic government.

Solution:
[math](viii)\rightarrow(x)\rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(iv) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(v) \rightarrow(iii) \rightarrow(vii) \rightarrow(ix) \rightarrow(vi)[/math]Nelson Mandela was the greatest leader of South Africa. In fact, he was one of the greatest leaders of the world who struggled against apartheid throughout his whole life. The blacks were treated cruelly. They were denied all basic human rights. They were aliens in their own country and were subjected to all sorts of indignities. Even dogs received a much better treatment than the blacks. The great leader vowed to put an end to the inhuman practice. He was thrown behind the prison bar. But the oppressive rulers could not break the spirit. Eventually, the great leader realised the goal of liberating his own people.

Explanation:
Sentence (viii) is the topic sentence because it gives the main idea — Nelson Mandela as the greatest South African leader — while the other sentences supply specific supporting details (the blacks' suffering, his vow, imprisonment, struggle and eventual liberation). Sentence (x) serves as a concluding restatement that reinforces the main point.

Explanation:
All the given sentences are historically accurate and form a coherent biography of Rabindranath Tagore: he was born in 1861 at Jorasanko, began writing very young (around eight), went to London at seventeen in 1878 and returned in 1880 without formal qualifications, and his London stay influenced him. He continued writing throughout his life, produced the acclaimed Bengali collection Gitanjali (for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1913), so each statement correctly describes a part of his life and work.

[math](iii)\rightarrow(v)\rightarrow(viii) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(vi) \rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(x) \rightarrow(ix) \rightarrow(vii) \rightarrow(iv)[/math]Long ago, there lived a Sultan in a country. He wanted to appoint an honest man as his tax collector. So, he asked for the wise counselor's advice. Then he invited applications. A number of people applied for the job. The applicants were asked to meet the Sultan one by one. They came through a passage where gold coins were kept. When they all arrived, the Sultan asked them to dance. All the applicants blushed and refused except one. Then he found the desired man.

Explanation:
The correct order follows a simple cause–effect sequence: (c) introduces the Sultan, (e) gives his goal, and (h) shows he asks the wise counselor for a plan. The counselor’s plan leads him to (a) invite applicants and (f) receive applications, then (b) call them to meet; they (j) come through the passage and (i) are asked to dance as the test, after which (g) all but one refuse and (d) the Sultan finds the honest man.

Solution:
[math](c)\rightarrow(g)\rightarrow(b) \rightarrow(d) \rightarrow(j) \rightarrow(e) \rightarrow(f) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(a) \rightarrow(h)[/math]Nobel Prize is the world's most important prize. The prize is given to persons with most outstanding contribution. The prize is instituted by a man who was the inventor of the science of destruction. He is Alfred Bernard Nobel. He was born in Stockholm on 21st October, 1833 and he died on 10th December, 1896. Though he is a citizen of Sweden, he was educated in Russia. Nobel Prizes are awarded every year for outstanding achievements in the field of science, literature and for promoting world's peace. Economics was added to the list in 1969 for the first time. One prize is awarded in each field. If there are more than one recipient of the prize in one field, the prize money is equally distributed amongst all the winners.

Explanation:
Explanation: The correct statements describe the factual rules and history of the Nobel Prizes — Alfred Nobel (born 21 October 1833, died 10 December 1896) established prizes that are awarded annually for outstanding contributions in specified fields. The Economics prize was first awarded in 1969, and when a prize has multiple recipients it may be shared and the prize money divided among them. These points are supported by the Nobel Foundation’s rules and historical records.

He then sought the wise counsellor’s advice and set a test — asking applicants to pass (asked them to “dance”) through a passage where gold coins were kept — which revealed honesty because all refused except one, and thus he found the desired man.

Solution:
[math](c)\rightarrow(i)\rightarrow(g) \rightarrow(j) \rightarrow(a) \rightarrow(e) \rightarrow(d) \rightarrow(b) \rightarrow(h) \rightarrow(f)[/math]Once a lad went to a famous teacher. He had expressed his desire to acquire knowledge. He begged to instruct him in the arts and sciences. The teacher wished to find out the ability of the boy. He asked him where God was. The lad replied that he would answer if he would tell where He is not. The teacher thought highly of the boy's understanding. He praised him highly. He agreed to teach the lad. The boy devoted himself to earning knowledge.

Explanation:
Correct order: (c) → (i) → (g) → (h) → (j) → (a) → (e) → (d) → (b) → (f). This sequence is logical because it shows the lad arriving and asking for instruction, the teacher agreeing and then testing the boy’s ability, the test question being asked and answered cleverly, the teacher being impressed and praising him, and finally the boy devoting himself to learning.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
[math](iv)\rightarrow(ix)\rightarrow(v) \rightarrow(x) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(iii) \rightarrow(vi) \rightarrow(viii) \rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(vii)[/math]Aristotle was born in Greece. He was the son of a royal physician. His father wanted him to be a physician but he never cherished to be so. He wanted to be a free thinker. As a result, he studied under a great thinker named Plato. Plato taught Aristotle according to his own way. Later on, Aristotle took the pen to write on topics suitable for human civilization. 'Politics' is one of his famous books which exposes fullest development of his wisdom. He also wrote books on Biology, Literature, Economics and Comparative Politics. He is called the father of Biology because of his creativity.

Explanation:
The correct order follows a clear biographical and logical flow: it begins with his birth and family background, moves to his father's wish and Aristotle’s desire to be a free thinker (which led him to study under Plato), then mentions Plato’s teaching, followed by Aristotle’s later writing activity and the subjects he covered, his recognition as the father of Biology, and ends with his famous book "Politics." Each sentence therefore connects by cause–effect or topical progression, creating a coherent paragraph about Aristotle.

Solution:
[math](ix)\rightarrow(v)\rightarrow(ii) \rightarrow(x) \rightarrow(viii) \rightarrow(vii) \rightarrow(iii) \rightarrow(i) \rightarrow(vi) \rightarrow(iv)[/math]One day Napoleon, the king of France, was walking along the sea shore. Suddenly he noticed a wonderful thing. An English boy was making a small boat. The boy was brought before him and he asked him what he would do with such a small boat. The boy said, "My country is on the other side of the sea." "I haven't seen my mother for a long time." "I shall cross the sea and go to my country by this boat." "Please let me go to my country." Napoleon was charmed by the words of the small boy. He made all arrangements to send him to his country.

Explanation:
The correct sequence puts the scene-setting first — Napoleon walking by the sea and seeing the boy make a boat — so the story naturally begins with (ix) and (ii), followed by Napoleon questioning the boy (x). The boy’s replies logically follow: he says his country is across the sea, expresses longing for his mother and asks to be allowed to go, and promises to cross by the boat — (viii), (vii), (i), (iii); these lines answer Napoleon’s question and create an emotional appeal. Napoleon’s reaction and the outcome come last: he notices something wonderful, is charmed by the boy’s words, and arranges to send him home — (v), (vi), (iv), which completes the cause–effect progression.

6. (vi) → (x) → (iii) → (iv) → (ix) → (i)→(v) (vii)→ (viii)→ (ii)

There was a remote village named Somal. The villagers were enchanted by a man. His name was Nambi. He lived in a temple at the edge of the village and passed his time under the banyan tree in front of the temple. He was so ignorant that he could not tell his age, but he could make up stories. He used to tell interesting stories to the people of the village. Before telling a story, he used to light a lamp in front of the tree. One day, he could not continue his story. After a few days, he called the villagers and told them something. He never spoke the rest of his life.

Explanation:
Correct order: (vi), (iii), (iv), (ix), (v), (i), (x), (vii), (viii), (ii). This order creates a logical story: it starts with the village and the man's identity, describes where and how he lived and his nature, then shows his ritual and storytelling that enchanted the villagers. The sequence ends with the turning point (he could not continue), the follow-up (he called them and spoke), and the final outcome (he never spoke again).

Explanation: The story begins with the Sultan and his need for an honest tax collector, so he invites applications and people apply; they are made to meet him and pass through a passage of gold before being asked to dance, which exposes their honesty (they blush and refuse except one). After observing this, the Sultan asks his wise counselors for advice and then finds the desired man.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Ans to the Q. no. 6(iv) (vi) (ix)→(x)→ (vii) (ii) (iii)→ (v)→(viii)→ (i)A snake lived in a hole at the foot of a tree. High up on its branches was the nest of a crow. The crow had four young chicks in its nest. Whenever the crow would leave the nest to bring food for its chicks, the snake would climb up and eat one. In this way, the snake ate up three of the chicks. The crow at last thought of a plan to get rid of its enemy. It stole an expensive necklace of the princess from the royal palace and dropped it into the snake's hole after scattering a few rubies here and there. The king became very angry at the loss and sent out men to look for the necklace. In course of time, they noticed the scattered rubies near the hole. They dug the hole, killed the snake, andtook the necklace

Explanation:
Correct order: (iv), (vi), (ix), (x), (vii), (ii), (iii), (v), (viii), (i).

Explanation: The sequence starts with the setting (snake in a hole and the crow’s nest with chicks), then shows the problem (snake climbing and eating three chicks), followed by the crow’s plan and action (dropping the necklace into the hole). Finally the king’s search leads to finding the scattered rubies, digging up the hole and killing the snake to recover the necklace, which preserves clear cause-and-effect flow.

Ans to the Q. no. 6.[math]\\[/math](v) → (i) → (ix) → (iv)→(x)→(ii)→(viii)→(iii) → (vi) → (vii)Once upon a time, there lived a fox in a forest. One day, he was very hungry. He searched food everywhere, but he did not get any food. At last, he entered into a vineyard. There were ripe grapes hanging up on the vine. The grapes were too high for him to reach. He took a run and jumped to reach the bunch of grapes but could not reach it. Again and again he jumped. But each time, he failed to reach the grapes. At last being tired, he went away saying that the grapes were sour.

Explanation:
Correct sequence is: (v), (i), (ix), (iv), (x), (ii), (viii), (iii), (vi), (vii). This order introduces the fox and his hunger, shows his search and entry into the vineyard where he finds ripe grapes that are too high, and then describes his attempts to reach them. Finally, after repeated failures he gives up and says the grapes are sour, which logically concludes the story.

ঘ উত্তর: (i) "The city held a banquet celebrating the voyage's departure." — এটি বেমানান কারণ গল্পের মূল ফোকাস ছিল প্রার্থী নির্বাচন ও পরীক্ষার আচরণ পর্যবেক্ষণ; শহরের বানকোয়েট ঘটনাটিকে পরে ঘটতে পারে, কিন্তু তা নির্বাচনের লজিক বা কারণ-ফল সম্পর্ক ব্যাখ্যা করে না, তাই অপ্রাসঙ্গিক বিবেচিত।

খ অনুচ্ছেদ: A shrewd merchant needed a reliable apprentice for his busy inland shop. He posted a notice asking for applicants who could keep accurate accounts. On the first day, applicants were asked to balance a ledger from a complicated delivery. Most of the others hurried to finish, claiming totals without recounting, but one applicant carefully counted and wrote down each coin, then paused to apologize and return an extra coin he had found on the floor. The merchant observed which applicants corrected mistakes rather than hiding them, and after selecting the honest, careful applicant he took the chosen apprentice to his warehouse to show him the ropes. The chosen apprentice later became the head of the firm.

গ উত্তর: সবচেয়ে গুরুত্ব দেওয়া হয়েছিল সততা ও লিখিত হিসাব-সযত্ন (honesty and meticulousness)। যে প্রার্থী অতিরিক্ত কয়েন ফেরত দিলেন এবং ভুল ধরা পরলে তা সংশোধন করলেন—এই আচরণ দেখালো যে তিনি লাভের জন্য ত্রুটি লুকাবেন না এবং হিসাব-নিকাশে সঠিক থাকবেন। এজন্য তিনি নির্বাচিত হন।

ঘ উত্তর: (H) "After hiring, the merchant sent a notice praising all the applicants equally." — এটি অসমঞ্জস্য কারণ গল্পের বর্ণনায় merchant স্পষ্টভাবে একজনকে বেছে নিয়েছেন এবং ভবিষ্যত নেতৃত্বের কথা বলা হয়েছে; যদি তিনি সবার জন্য সমান প্রশংসা পাঠাতেন, তাহলে নির্বাচনের বৈশিষ্ট্য অর্থহীন হতো। তাই (H) ঘটনাটির ধারাবাহিকতায় প্রাসঙ্গিক নয়।

Explanation:
সাজানোর মূল নীতি: প্রথমে প্রয়োজন ও বিজ্ঞপ্তি, তারপর পরীক্ষা, পরীক্ষার সময়কার পৃথক আচরণগুলি, পর্যবেক্ষণ ও সিদ্ধান্ত, এবং অবশেষে ফলাফল। কোন বিবৃতি গল্পের মূল যুক্তি বা ক্রমানুসরণ ভেঙে দেয় তা নির্ণয় করে অপ্রাসঙ্গিক অংশ টিহচ করা হয়েছে। সততা ও লক্ষ্যভিত্তিক সতর্কতার কারণে নির্বাচনের যুক্তি পরিষ্কার—হিসাব-নিকাশে ভুল ঢেকে রাখলে পরে বড় ক্ষতি হতে পারে, তাই যিনি ভুল ধরেছেন বা ফেরত দিয়েছেন তিনি সেরা প্রার্থী।

ক সাজানো ক্রম: (a) → (b) → (d) → (c) → (e) → (f) → (g) → (h). (বৈশিষ্ট্যগতভাবে (i) অপ্রাসঙ্গিক এবং বাদ দেওয়া হয়েছে)

খ অনুচ্ছেদ: Years of bandit attacks had disrupted trade across the desert. A wealthy governor decided to appoint a new caravan leader and many brave men presented themselves at the governor's hall. He announced a test: candidates must guide a small convoy through the tracked dunes at dawn. During the test one candidate stopped to help a stranded merchant whose cart had broken. The governor later learned that the stranded merchant was a friend sent to observe the candidates. The man who helped was chosen because he valued people's safety over speed. The governor rewarded the new leader with a safe passage certificate and a pouch of silver.

গ উত্তর: শাসক পরীক্ষার মাধ্যমে নৈতিকতা—বিশেষত সততা ও দয়া/পরামর্শভিত্তিক দায়িত্ববোধ—পরীক্ষা করতে চেয়েছিলেন। এটি প্রকাশ পেয়েছে যখন একজন প্রার্থী বিপজ্জনক পরিস্থিতিতে গতি বজায় রাখার পরিবর্তে একজন বিপন্ন ব্যবসায়ীকে সাহায্য করে; সেই কাজে তিনি নিজের কর্তব্য ও মানুষের সুরক্ষা অগ্রাধিকার দিলেন। শাসক ধারালো পর্যবেক্ষণ করে এই আচরণকে পুরস্কৃত করেছেন।

ঘ উত্তর: (i) "The governor held a festival in the town square afterwards." — এটি অপ্রাসঙ্গিক কারণ এটি প্রধান ঘটনাটির কারণ-প্রভাব বা নির্বাচন প্রক্রিয়ার সঙ্গে সম্পর্কিত নয়; গল্পের মূল সংলগ্ন ক্রমে এটি কোনো ভূমিকা রাখে না এবং গল্পের সিদ্ধান্ত বা পরীক্ষার ফলাফল ব্যাখ্যা করে না।

Explanation:
ক্রমানুসরণ নির্ধারণের জন্য আমরা ঘটনার কারণ-প্রভাব ও ক্রোনোলজিকাল নির্দেশনা অনুসরণ করেছি: প্রথম সমস্যাটি (বন্দুক/ডাকাত আক্রমণের কারণে বাণিজ্য বিপর্যস্ত), এরপর নির্ভরশীল নেতা নিয়োগের প্রয়োজন দেখা দেয় এবং আবেদনপত্র/প্রার্থী উপস্থিতি, পরীক্ষার ঘোষণা, পরীক্ষার ঘটনায় সহায়তার ঘটনা, পর্যবেক্ষক/পরীক্ষক-র প্রকাশ এবং অবশেষে পুরস্কার—এই সারি লজিকালি সাজে। অপ্রাসঙ্গিক বিবৃতি চিহ্নিত করার সময় আমি এই বিবৃতির সরাসরি প্রাসঙ্গিকতা বা গল্পের তীর্যকতায় অবদান না থাকার ওপর নজর দিয়েছি।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক ক্রম: (b) → (c) → (d) → (e) → (g) → (a) → (f) → (h) → (i) → (j)

খ জীবনী: Professor Laila Chowdhury was born on 1 September 1940 in Sylhet and began formal schooling at age seven. She completed her M.A. in Education from Dhaka University in 1962. Supported by her husband, Dr. Minar, she pursued research and in 1983 published a widely-used textbook for primary teachers. She drafted the National Primary Education Policy in 1990 and later served as Director of Curriculum Development from 1995 to 2000. In recognition of her contributions she received the Ekushey Padak in 2002, retired in 2005, and passed away on 10 April 2015.

গ প্রকাশনা, নীতি ও পুরস্কার:
- প্রকাশনা: (g) — 1983 সালে পাঠ্যপুস্তক প্রকাশ।
- নীতিনির্ধারণ: (a) — 1990 সালে জাতীয় প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা নীতি রচনা।
- পুরস্কার: (h) — Ekushey Padak (2002)।
(উল্লেখ্য: (f) প্রশাসনিক ভূমিকা—ক্যারিয়ারের গুরুত্বপূর্ণ পদও বটে।)

ঘ জন্ম: 1 September 1940; মৃত্যু: 10 April 2015.
বয়স হিসাব: 2015 − 1940 = 75 বছর। তবুও 2015 সালের 10 এপ্রিল পর্যন্ত তাঁর 75তম জন্মদিন (1 September) আসেনি, তাই মৃত্যুকালে পূর্ণ বয়সে তিনি ছিলেন 74 বছর। (সংক্ষেপে: 74 বছর এবং প্রায় 7 মাস)।

Explanation:
ক: ঘটনাগুলোকে সাজাতে জন্ম ও প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা প্রথমে, এরপর উচ্চশিক্ষা ও পারিবারিক সহায়তা, প্রকাশনা ও নীতিনির্মাণ, প্রশাসনিক দায়িত্ব, পুরস্কার, অবসর ও মৃত্যু—এই ধারাকে অনুসরণ করা হয়েছে।

গ: প্রকাশনা ও নীতিনির্মাণের বাক্যগুলোতে সরাসরি 'published' ও 'drafted the policy' শব্দগুলো থাকায় সেগুলো চিহ্নিত করা হয়েছে; পুরস্কার (Ekushey Padak) সরাসরি স্বীকৃতির ইঙ্গিত দেয়।

ঘ: সঠিক বয়স নির্ণয়ের জন্য জন্মবর্ষ থেকে মৃত্যুবর্ষ বিয়োগ করে দেখতে হয় ওই বছরে জন্মদিন পার হয়েছে কি না; এখানে পার হয়নি, তাই এক বছর কম ধরা হয়েছে।

খ জীবনী: Dr. Sufia Rahman was born on 15 February 1930 in Mymensingh. Her father, Abdul Karim, was a school teacher who encouraged her studies. At age five she attended the local primary school in her village. In 1948 she received a scholarship to study at Dhaka University, and later she completed her MBBS with honours from Dhaka Medical College in 1954. She went on to earn a doctorate in public health from the London School of Hygiene in 1962. Dr. Rahman championed rural healthcare programs across Bangladesh and in 1980 she established the Sufia Medical Foundation to expand services. After retirement she wrote essays about women’s health and education. She passed away peacefully on 22 October 2005.

গ উচ্চতর শিক্ষা/ডিগ্রি নির্দেশ করে এমন বাক্য: (a), (d), (h).
- (a) বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে ভর্তি/স্কলারশিপ – উচ্চতর শিক্ষার সূত্রপাত নির্দেশ করে।

- (h) ডক্টরেট (ডক্টর ইন পাবলিক হেলথ) স্পষ্টভাবে উচ্চতর ডিগ্রী।

ঘ জন্ম: 15 February 1930; মৃত্যু: 22 October 2005.
বয়স হিসাব: 2005 − 1930 = 75 বছর. কারণ তিনি 2005 সালে তার জন্মদিন (15 Feb) পূর্ণ করে ফেলেছেন; মৃত্যুকাল (22 Oct 2005) তখনো তার 75 তম জন্মবছরের ভেতর, তাই তাঁর বয়স ছিল 75 বছর।

Explanation:
ক: বাক্যগুলোর কালানুক্রমিক সাজানোতে জন্মসংক্রান্ত বক্তব্য (b) প্রথমে আসে; পিতার পরিচয় (e) ও প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা (g) পরে অনুসরণ করে; বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ভর্তি/স্কলারশিপ (a) কলেজ পড়াশোনা শুরু হওয়ার ইঙ্গিত দেয়; MBBS (d) ও পরে ডক্টরেট (h) উচ্চতর শিক্ষার পর্যায় নির্দেশ করে; কর্মজীবনে স্বাস্থ্যচর্চা ও প্রতিষ্ঠা (c, f) পরে আসে; অবসরের পরে লেখালেখি (i) এবং সর্বশেষ মৃত্যু (j) অবস্থান করে।

গ: উচ্চতর শিক্ষা চিহ্নিত করতে বাক্যের মধ্যে সরাসরি ডিগ্রী বা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়/স্কলারশিপের উল্লেখ খোঁজা হয়েছে।

ঘ: বয়স নির্ণয়ের জন্য বরাবরই বছর গণনা করে দেখা হয়েছে যে জন্মবছরের জন্মদিনটির (15 Feb) পরে মৃত্যু ঘটেছে গত বছরের তুলনায়, তাই সরল বিয়োগব্যবহার যথাযথ।

খ জীবনী: Anwar Hossain was born on 12 March 1945 in Chittagong. At age 12 he apprenticed under a master craftsman, Master Karim, who passed on traditional woodcut skills. He completed a Fine Arts degree from a Kolkata art college in 1966 and in the late 1960s began experimenting with printmaking techniques. His early exhibitions in the 1970s brought critical praise, and in 1985 he founded the arts collective "Kala Mancha". He received the National Art Award in 1998, later wrote an influential essay on modern Bangladeshi art in 2001, and passed away on 3 January 2010.

গ ক্যারিয়ারের প্রধান মাইলফলক/উপলব্ধি নির্দেশকারী বাক্য: (c), (i), (d), (g), (e), (f), (a), (h).
- (c) ও (i): প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা ও দক্ষতা-অর্জন (apprenticeship ও woodcut দক্ষতা)।
- (d): আনুষ্ঠানিক আর্ট শিক্ষার সমাপ্তি (ডিগ্রী)।
- (g): নতুন প্রযুক্তি/শৈলী অনুশীলন—সৃজনশীল উন্নতি।

- (a): জাতীয় পুরস্কার—উল্লেখযোগ্য স্বীকৃতি।
- (h): আকাদেমিক/নিবন্ধনমূলক অবদান।

ঘ জন্ম: 12 March 1945; মৃত্যু: 3 January 2010.
বয়স হিসাব: 2010 − 1945 = 65 বছর। কিন্তু 2010 সালের 3 জানুয়ারি তার জন্মদিন (12 March) এখনও আসেনি, তাই তিনি সম্পূর্ণ 65 বছর পূর্ণ করেননি। তাই মৃত্যুকালের প্রকৃত বয়স = 64 বছর। (সংক্ষেপে: তিনি 64 বছর এবং প্রায় 10 মাস বয়স ছিলেন।)

Explanation:
ক: প্রথমে জন্ম (b), তারপর ছোটবেলার প্রশিক্ষণ (c) ও মেন্টরের শিক্ষা (i), এর পরে আনুষ্ঠানিক ডিগ্রী (d) এবং 1960–এর শেষভাগে প্রিন্টমেকিং অনুশীলন (g), পরবর্তী দশকে প্রদর্শনী (e), তারপর 1985-এ সংগঠন গঠন (f), 1998-এ জাতীয় পুরস্কার (a), 2001-এ প্রবন্ধ (h) এবং শেষেই মৃত্যু (j)।

ঘ: সঠিক বয়স নির্ণয়ের জন্য জন্মতারিখ ও মৃত্যুর তারিখের মাস/দিন বিবেচনা করা প্রয়োজন; যদি মৃত্যুর বছর থেকে জন্মবর্ষ বিয়োগ করে এবং সেই বছরের জন্মদিন পার হয়ে গেছে কিনা চেক করা হয়। এখানে জন্মদিন 12 March, আর মৃত্যু 3 January — জন্মদিন পার হয়নি, তাই এক বছর কম ধরা হয়।

Question:
The following sentences about a traveling tinker and a mountain village are jumbled. Rearrange them so they form a coherent short narrative.

Options:
ক. Rearrange the sentences in a proper sequence.
খ. Which sentence should appear first? Write its number and full text.
গ. Which sentence marks the turning point or climax of the story? Give its number and explain why.
ঘ. Write a one-sentence summary of the arranged story.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (ii) → (v) → (iv) → (vii) → (iii) → (i) → (ix) → (viii) → (vi) → (x)

খ First sentence: (ii) "The mountain village of Dhol was cut off by snow every winter."

গ Turning point/climax: (ix) "The tinker showed them how to fix a broken plow and won their gratitude." — This is the emotional turning point because it changes the villagers' attitude toward the stranger: from curiosity and playfulness to genuine appreciation and reliance on him.

ঘ One-sentence summary: A lone traveling tinker arrives in the snowbound village of Dhol, wins the people's hearts by repairing their tools, accepts their hospitality, and is finally asked to stay when the road reopens.

Explanation:
Reasoning and cues used to order the sentences:
- Sentence (ii) describes the setting (a mountain village cut off by snow), so it naturally serves as the opening scene.
- Sentence (v) "One spring, the sound of distant drums drew him toward the valley" explains the tinker’s arrival and timing—placing it shortly after the setting introduction.
- Sentence (iv) "For seven years he had walked from village to village, selling his skills" provides background about his long wandering life and fits before details about his possessions and arrival.
- Sentence (vii) "He carried only a bag of tools and a battered copper cup" logically follows the background about wandering life, showing what he had with him.
- Sentence (iii) "Children ran after him, shouting and asking for repairs" depicts his immediate reception on arrival and leads to concrete actions.
- Sentence (i) "He hammered tiny bells into the broken cart wheel" is an example of his craft and precedes the more important repair that changes everything.
- Sentence (ix) is chosen as the turning point because repairing the plow resolves a practical village problem and shifts their attitude to gratitude.
- Sentence (viii) "An old woman offered him a warm stew and a place to sleep" and (vi) "At dusk he sat by the hearth and mended small toys" show the villagers’ hospitality and the tinker’s evening routine after earning their trust.
- Sentence (x) "When the road reopened, the people begged him to stay" serves as the close, showing the final outcome and the village’s changed wish.
Clues such as temporal words ("one spring", "for seven years", "at dusk", "when the road reopened") and cause-effect relationships (repair → gratitude → hospitality → petition to stay) determined the ordering.

Question:
The following sentences tell the story of a lighthouse keeper and a tragic night. The sentences are jumbled. Arrange them into a coherent sequence and answer the sub-questions below.

Options:
ক. Rearrange the sentences in a proper sequence.
খ. Which sentence begins the story? Give its number and full text.
গ. Which sentence best describes the disastrous consequence? Give its number and explain why it is the climax.
ঘ. Provide a one-sentence summary of the ordered story.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (i) → (v) → (ii) → (iv) → (vi) → (vii) → (x) → (viii) → (iii) → (ix)

খ First sentence: (i) "The keeper's name was Selim, and he had a small wooden chest of maps."

গ Turning point/climax: (iii) "A merchant's ship crashed on the rocks during a storm." — This sentence is the dramatic consequence of the lamp's failure and represents the story's tragic peak: the lighthouse's duty to warn failed and a ship was wrecked.

ঘ One-sentence summary: Selim, a devoted lighthouse keeper, faces a winter failure of his lamp; despite desperate makeshift efforts and villagers' help the light falters and a merchant ship is wrecked, leaving a coastline of debris and grief the next morning.

Explanation:
How the order was determined:
- (i) introduces the protagonist, Selim, and his maps—establishing who keeps watch.
- (v) "Years ago, he had promised the sea he would keep watch forever" gives his vow and motivation early on.
- (ii) describes his usual care: "Each night the lamp burned steady because he polished its brass before dusk," setting up the normal routine.
- (iv) "People whispered that the light sometimes blinked like a human eye" adds atmosphere and local rumor before trouble begins.
- (vi) "One winter, the brass mechanism stuck and the wick would not catch" introduces the mechanical failure—the inciting incident.
- (vii) "He climbed the spiral stairs and found the glass broken and covered in sea salt" shows the discovery of the fault and his immediate response.
- (x) "Heartbroken, Selim set up a makeshift lantern to warn passing sailors" shows his improvisation and intent to avert disaster.
- (viii) "The villagers sent a boy to borrow oil from the inland town" indicates the community’s attempt to help while the crisis unfolds.
- (iii) then follows as the tragic consequence when the warning was inadequate or too late: a merchant ship crashes.
- (ix) "The next morning the coastline was littered with flotsam but no survivors" closes the sequence with the aftermath.
Key clues: chronological markers like "years ago," "one winter," and "the next morning," plus causal language (mechanism stuck → broken glass → makeshift lantern → ship crash) guided the arrangement and selection of the climax.

Question:
Below are ten jumbled sentences about an old gardener and a miraculous seed. Rearrange them into a meaningful story and answer the questions that follow.

Options:
ক. Rearrange the sentences in a proper sequence.
খ. Which sentence should be the opening line? Provide its number and text.
গ. Which sentence signals the miraculous event and why is it pivotal? Give its number and explanation.
ঘ. Write a concise one-sentence summary of the arranged story.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (ii) → (x) → (i) → (iii) → (iv) → (v) → (vi) → (viii) → (vii) → (ix)

খ First sentence: (ii) "He found a tiny black seed under the roots of an old fig tree."

গ Miraculous event: (v) "One spring a silver tree grew overnight, its leaves shimmering in moonlight." — This is the pivotal miracle because it transforms the gardener's patient care into a visible, extraordinary result that changes the village's perception.

ঘ One-sentence summary: A solitary gardener plants and faithfully tends a mysterious seed despite mockery, and when it sprouts overnight into a silver tree whose fruits hold memories, the village's ridicule turns into wonder and reverence.

Explanation:
Ordering logic and narrative cues:
- (ii) "He found a tiny black seed..." is a natural story opener—an inciting discovery.
- (x) "He planted the seed near the village well and whispered a story into it" follows as the gardener's deliberate act after finding the seed.
- (i) "The gardener had no family but spoke to the plants every morning" provides character background and explains why he would whisper to a seed.
- (iii) "Neighbors mocked him..." sets up the conflict: social ridicule for his devotion.
- (iv) "He watered the seed through droughts and frosts without fail" shows perseverance across hardship.
- (v) is the miracle—overnight growth of a silver tree—marking the story’s major turning point.
- (vi) "Children climbed its branches and found fruits that tasted of memories" shows the magical, communal result of the miracle and its immediate effect on villagers.
- (viii) "The gardener pressed his palm to the trunk and felt his wife's laugh inside it" adds an intimate, emotional payoff for the gardener and explains the tree’s deeper meaning.
- (vii) "A scholar came from the city to study the marvelous tree" shows external recognition and curiosity.
- (ix) "At last the village stopped laughing and began to bring offerings" provides the resolution: public acceptance and reverence.
Temporal clues ("overnight", "through droughts and frosts") and cause-effect (planting + care → miracle → communal and personal consequences) informed the chosen sequence and identification of the miraculous event.

খ. Write the complete story in full sentences according to that order.
গ. State the moral of the story in one sentence.
ঘ. Name two characters and the setting (place) mentioned in the story.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (c) → (d) → (e) → (g) → (h) → (f) → (b) → (i)

খ Once upon a time, a thirsty ant went down to drink at the river bank. The dove saw the ant struggling in the water and quickly dropped a large leaf beside it. The ant climbed onto the leaf and floated safely to the shore. After being saved, the ant wished it could repay the dove's kindness. Later a hunter came near and tried to catch the dove. The hunter raised his net to catch the dove when it came to the tree. Seeing its friend in danger, the ant crawled up the hunter's foot and bit him sharply. The dove flew away at once and escaped the hunter's net.

গ Be kind and help others; kindness is often repaid.

ঘ Characters: the ant, the dove. Setting: the river bank (near the river).

Explanation:
Order reasoning: Sentence (c) sets the scene — the ant at the river — so it must come first. Sentence (d) logically follows because the dove responds to the ant struggling. Sentence (e) completes that action (ant reaches shore). Sentence (g) expresses the ant's desire to repay, which naturally comes after being saved. Sentence (h) introduces a new problem — the hunter — so it follows. Sentence (f) shows the hunter's action preparing to catch the dove. In (b) the ant intervenes by biting the hunter, causing the outcome in (i) where the dove escapes. The moral and characters are inferred from the cause–effect chain and the actions of the animals.

গ. Pick two verbs from the paragraph that are in the past tense.
ঘ. Suggest a suitable title (5 words or fewer) for the paragraph.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (c) → (f) → (b) → (h) → (d) → (a) → (e) → (g)

খ One morning Raju found a tiny mango sapling at the nursery and decided to buy it. "I will help you grow, little tree," he said and carried it home with care. He dug a hole, placed the sapling carefully and covered its roots with soil. The sapling needed water and care to survive. Every day he watered it and protected it from goats and weeds. Years passed and that small sapling grew into a shady mango tree. Now many birds came to build their nests on the tree and neighbours praised him. One summer the family sat under its cool shade and enjoyed ripe mangoes together.

গ Two past-tense verbs: "found", "dug".

ঘ Title: "Raju's Mango Tree"

Explanation:
Order reasoning: (c) introduces the boy and the sapling, so it must start. In (f) Raju speaks and takes the sapling home; (b) describes planting the sapling next. Sentence (h) explains the sapling's needs, which leads naturally into (d) where Raju cares for it daily. (a) and (e) describe the long-term results (tree growth and birds), and (g) gives the final pleasant outcome of ripe mangoes shared by the family. The past-tense verbs were chosen by scanning verbs that clearly indicate completed actions. The suggested title captures the main subject concisely.

খ One day all the animals decided they could not live with the fearful lion any longer. The rabbit was chosen to speak to the lion because it was small and brave. The lion roared and asked who dared to oppose him. The rabbit led the lion to a deep well and told him there was another lion living inside. The rabbit waited until the lion looked into the well and saw his own reflection. The annoyed lion jumped into the well to fight the rival, and he could not get out. From that day the animals lived in peace because the lion was gone.

গ The rabbit tricked the lion into thinking his reflection was another lion, prompting the lion to jump into the well.

ঘ Lesson: Cleverness and courage can overcome brute strength; wit is powerful.

Explanation:
Order reasoning: (b) sets up the problem (animals disturbed by the lion). (d) explains who is sent to help. (e) shows the lion's reaction when confronted. The rabbit then leads the lion to the well in (a). Sentence (f) describes how the rabbit used the reflection trick, which causes (c) — the lion's downfall. Finally (g) states the outcome. The trick is identified concisely and the moral summarizes the fable's teaching about intelligence over force.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (c) → (a) → (g) → (b) → (e) → (d) → (f) → (h)

খ Mirza Karim was a local zamindar sympathetic to his people's hardships. He noticed that villagers had to walk long distances to fetch water and that many families fell ill from drinking brackish water. The river nearby had become saline due to tidal intrusion, worsening the crisis. He invited engineers to design a safe embankment and organized funds and local labour to construct a freshwater reservoir. The reservoir supplied drinking water for decades, and the success of the reservoir inspired nearby parishes to start similar projects.

গ সেরা শুরু: (c) "A local zamindar named Mirza Karim was sympathetic to their plight." — কারণ এটি প্রধান চরিত্র (কারিম) পরিচয় করায় এবং পরে তার কার্যকলাপ এবং সিদ্ধান্তগুলো ব্যাখ্যার জন্য প্রেক্ষাপট দেয়।

ঘ সেরা উপসংহার: (h) "The success of the reservoir inspired nearby parishes to start similar projects." — কারণ এটি কাজের দীর্ঘমেয়াদি প্রভাব এবং ফলাফলকে সারসংক্ষেপ করে, গল্পের শেষটিকে প্রাসঙ্গিকভাবে বন্ধ করে।

Explanation:
ক: ক্রমটি নির্বাচন করার সময় প্রথমে চরিত্রের পরিচয়, তারপর সমস্যা চিহ্নিতকরণ, সমস্যার প্রভাব, কারণ নির্ণয়, পরিকল্পনা ও বাস্তবায়ন, এবং শেষে ফলাফল ও প্রভাব—এই ধারাকে বজায় রাখা হয়েছে।

খ: অনুচ্ছেদটি সংহত হতে মূলত কারণ-ইফল কাঠামো অনুসরণ করেছে: সমস্যার বর্ণনা → কারণ → সমাধানের পদক্ষেপ → ফলাফল। প্রতিটি বাক্য পূর্বতর বাক্যের সাথে যুক্ত রেখে ধারাবাহিকতা বজায় রাখে।

গ: কাহিনীর শুরুতে চরিত্র/প্রেক্ষাপট উপস্থাপন করলে পাঠক দ্রুত বুঝতে পারে কে সমস্যা সমাধান করল এবং কেন; তাই (c) শুরু হিসেবে উপযুক্ত।

ঘ: উপসংহার হিসেবে এমন বাক্য শ্রেয় যা কেবল ফলাফল নয়, তার সম্প্রসারণ বা অনুকরণীয় প্রভাবও দেখায়; তাই (h) নির্বাচন করা হলো।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক (c) → (a) → (b) → (e) → (d) → (f) → (g) → (h)

খ A Sufi saint, Maulana Atiq, settled by the coast to serve the community. The sandy coast was losing land every year to the sea, and people could no longer cultivate crops close to the shore. Initially, many were skeptical about planting trees instead of building walls. He taught villagers to plant mangrove seedlings along the tide line. Over time the mangroves reduced erosion and trapped silt; fish returned to the sheltered bays and livelihoods improved. His patient guidance changed the coastal landscape permanently.

গ সেরা শুরু: (c) "A Sufi saint, Maulana Atiq, settled by the coast to serve the community." — কারণ এটি প্রধান নায়ক ও তার উদ্দেশ্য উপস্থাপন করে, যা পাঠককে পরবর্তী সমস্যাগুলো ও সমাধানে প্রস্তুত করে।

ঘ সেরা সমাপ্তি: (h) "His patient guidance changed the coastal landscape permanently." — কারণ এটি দীর্ঘমেয়াদি পরিবর্তন এবং নৈতিক/শিক্ষণমূলক মূল্যবোধের উপর জোর দেয়, যা গল্পের উপসংহার হিসেবে শক্তিশালী।

Explanation:
ক: সঠিক ধারায় সাজালে আগে নায়ক ও তার উদ্দেশ্য, এরপর সমস্যার বর্ণনা, মানুষের প্রাথমিক প্রতিক্রিয়া, এবং তার পর কার্যপ্রণালী ও ফলাফল প্রদর্শিত হয়।

খ: অনুচ্ছেদটি কারণ ও প্রতিফলন দেখায় — প্রথমে সমস্যা, পরে সমাধান এবং শেষে তাৎপর্যপূর্ণ ফলাফল।

গ: চরিত্র-ভিত্তিক শুরু পাঠককে কার্যকরভাবে আবদ্ধ করে; তাই (c) শুরু হিসেবে নেয়া হয়েছে।

ঘ: (h) বাক্যটি শুধু ফলাফল নয়, টেকসই পরিবর্তন ও নেতার ভূমিকার সারকথাও তুলে ধরে; ফলে এটি উপসংহার হিসেবে সবচেয়ে উপযুক্ত।

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

খ An engineer named Rashid Ahmed returned from the city with new ideas. The low-lying town was prone to yearly floods that destroyed crops and roads, and many families had to move to temporary shelters during monsoon. He proposed a plan of raised embankments and elevated roads. Local people contributed labour after he held several meetings to explain the project. The embankments protected farmland and allowed trade to resume year-round; his project later became a model for other delta towns. The project showed how technical knowledge combined with community effort can solve recurring disasters.

গ সেরা শুরু: (c) "An engineer named Rashid Ahmed returned from the city with new ideas." — কারণ নায়ক এবং তার সম্ভাব্য সমাধান-দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি আগে উপস্থাপন করলে পার্লেই শুরু থেকে আগ্রহ জাগে এবং পরবর্তী সমস্যাগুলো ও পদক্ষেপের প্রাসঙ্গিকতা স্পষ্ট হয়।

ঘ সেরা উপসংহার: (g) "The project showed how technical knowledge combined with community effort can solve recurring disasters." — কারণ এটি প্রকল্পের সার্বিক শিক্ষণীয় দিক ও সাধারণীকরণ করে, যা পাঠককে মূল বিষয়বস্তুর মাধ্যমে ভাবতে বাধ্য করে।

Explanation:
ক: ধারাবাহিকতা বজায় রাখতে প্রথমে কারা জড়িত এবং তাদের ধারণা, তারপর সমস্যা, প্রস্তাবিত সমাধান, অংশগ্রহণ এবং শেষে ফলাফল ও প্রভাব—এই সিকোয়েন্স সুসংগত।

খ: অনুচ্ছেদটি বাস্তবকেন্দ্রিক: প্রকৌশলগত পরিকল্পনা ও স্থানীয় অংশগ্রহণ কিভাবে বাস্তবে কার্যকর হয় তা দেখায়।

গ: চরিত্র-ভিত্তিক সূচনা পাঠককে দ্রুত প্রেক্ষাপটের প্রতি মনোযোগী করে এবং কেন তিনি উদ্যোগ নিলেন তা ব্যাখ্যা করতে সহায়তা করে।

ঘ: (g) বাক্যটি কেবল ফলাফল নয়, প্রকল্প থেকে পাওয়া শিক্ষা ও মডেল হিসেবে গ্রহণযোগ্যতাও প্রদর্শন করে; তাই এটি শক্তিশালী উপসংহার।

গ অহিংস নীতির নির্দেশক বাক্যগুলো: (i), (vi), (viii), (iii), (ix).

ঘ ফলাফল/উপসংহার: (vii) — "India eventually achieved independence in 1947." (এই বাক্যটি অনুচ্ছেদের তুলনামূলক উপসংহার যা আগের ঘটনাগুলোর প্রতিফলন হিসেবে দেশের স্বাধীনতার অর্জনকে উপস্থাপন করে)।

গ তীব্র/আন্দোলনভিত্তিক কৌশলের ইঙ্গিতকারী বাক্য: (iii), (iv), (v).

ঘ দীর্ঘমেয়াদি প্রভাব: নারীদের ভোটাধিকার প্রতিষ্ঠার ফলে রাজনৈতিক প্রতিনিধিত্ব বেড়ে, সামাজিক নীতিতে পরিবর্তন আসে এবং পরবর্তীতে ব্যাপক লিঙ্গ-সমতার আইন ও নীতিমালা (viii) গড়ে ওঠে; এটি নারীশিক্ষা, শ্রমবাজারে অংশগ্রহণ ও আইনি অধিকার বৃদ্ধির পথ সুগম করে।

Explanation:
ক: সাজানোর যুক্তি — প্রথমে সমস্যার বর্ণনা (i), তখনকার শান্তিপূর্ণ দাবি (ii), প্রধান নেতাদের উত্থান (ix), ধীর গতিতে আক্ষেপ ও রূঢ়তর কৌশলে রূপান্তর (iii, iv), সরকারের কঠোর প্রতিক্রিয়া (v), জনমতের পরিবর্তন (vi) ও আইনি সাফল্য (vii), এবং তা থেকে বিস্তৃত সামাজিক সংস্কারে যাওয়া (viii) — এই সিরিজে ঘটনাগুলো স্বাভাবিক ধারায় সাজে।

ঘ: দীর্ঘমেয়াদি প্রভাব — রাজনৈতিক অংশগ্রহণে নারীদের অন্তর্ভুক্তি সমাজ ও সরকারি নীতিকে পুনরায় আকার দেয়; ভোটাধিকার কেবল এক আইনি অধিকার নয়, বরং সামাজিক এবং অর্থনৈতিক অধিকারগুলোর জন্য ভিত্তি হিসেবে কাজ করে, যা পরবর্তীতে ব্যাপক লিঙ্গনিরপেক্ষ সংস্কারের পথ প্রসারিত করে।

ক Chronological order: (i) → (iii) → (vii) → (ii) → (iv) → (vi) → (v) → (viii)

খ Incorrect statement: none of the listed items are essentially wrong in substance. (All eight statements are broadly accurate. If precision is required: statement (iii) ‘about twenty-two’ — Rabindranath Tagore married Mrinalini Devi in 1883 when he was 22, so the phrase is correct.)

গ He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913.

ঘ He renounced the knighthood in 1919 as a protest against the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and generally to condemn British repressive measures in India.

Explanation:
ক (chronology): Tagore was born in 1861 (i). He married Mrinalini Devi in 1883 at age 22 (iii). His outspoken opposition to the 1905 Partition of Bengal and related protest songs and poems came later (vii). Gitanjali and the work that brought him international attention were published before and around the time of his Nobel recognition (ii). He was knighted in 1915 by the British (iv) and then, after the 1919 Amritsar events, returned that title (explained in ঘ). The Nobel Prize year (vi) is 1913, and later he established Visva-Bharati at Santiniketan in 1921 (v). He died in 1941 (viii).

খ (incorrectness): All statements are summary facts about major milestones; no outright falsehood is present. One could quibble about exact years or wording, but the content is historically correct.

গ (Nobel year): The Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to him in 1913 largely for Gitanjali and his profound lyrical poetry.

ঘ (reason for renunciation): Tagore publicly renounced the knighthood as a moral and political protest after the slaughter at Jallianwala Bagh (Amritsar, 1919) and as a statement against colonial repression. This action was widely noted as a principled stand by an eminent cultural figure.

গ. Which of the statements names a specific famous poem of his? Mention the poem and briefly state its central theme.
ঘ. Explain in a few sentences why his poetry is considered modern and influential.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Chronological order: (i) → (ii) → (iv) → (v) → (iii) → (vii) → (vi)

খ Incorrect statement: none of the given statements are essentially false. (All items correctly summarize the poet's life. If detail is required: statement (iv) could be made more precise with publication years; but it is not incorrect.)

গ The famous poem named is 'Banalata Sen' (statement iii). Its central theme: a meditation on time, longing and relief—an exhausted traveler finds peace and timeless beauty in the figure of Banalata Sen, combining personal melancholy with mythic imagery.

ঘ His poetry is considered modern because of its innovative imagery, free-flowing syntax, urban and existential themes, and departure from older romantic and devotional conventions; he brought a new introspective voice and striking visual metaphors to Bengali verse, influencing later poets significantly.

Explanation:
ক (chronology): He was born in 1899 (i), took up teaching and lecturing as his profession (ii), and began publishing collections from the 1920s onward (iv). Financial and professional difficulties recurred in his life (v). His best-known poems, including 'Banalata Sen', exemplify his mature style (iii). Over ensuing decades literary critics and readers recognized his importance as a modern voice in Bengali poetry (vii). He died in Calcutta in 1954 after being struck by a vehicle—an abrupt end to his life (vi).

খ (incorrectness): Summaries are accurate; no statement is clearly false. Precise bibliographic dates could refine (iv), but this is not an error.

গ (poem and theme): 'Banalata Sen' is famous for blending a personal odyssey with timeless mythic reference; it evokes rest, meeting the beloved as a symbol of solace, and contemplates history and loneliness.

ঘ (modernity): The poet broke with established meter and diction norms, introduced urban loneliness and existential introspection into Bengali poetry, and used compressed, image-rich lines that later poets emulated. These innovations mark his lasting influence.

Question:
(i) She was born around the 1880s in the northern districts of Bengal and married at a young age, but continued self-education throughout her life.

(ii) In 1905 she published a pioneering feminist utopian short story in English that imagines a world run by women.

(iii) She established a school for girls to promote female education against prevailing conservative attitudes.

(iv) She campaigned for women's rights, including the right to education and economic independence.

গ. Which statement refers to a specific literary work? Name the work and the year it was first published.
ঘ. Summarize in two or three sentences her major contribution to society.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক Chronological order: (i) → (ii) → (iii) → (v) → (iv) → (vi)

খ Incorrect statement: none are fundamentally incorrect as summaries. (If precision is requested: in (vi) the phrase 'early 1930s'—she died in 1932, so stating the exact year clarifies the timeline.)

গ The specific literary work is the feminist utopian short story 'Sultana's Dream' (statement ii). It was first published in 1905.

ঘ Her major contribution: She pioneered advocacy for women's education and emancipation in Bengal, founded institutions (notably a school for girls), and used writing and public engagement to challenge restrictive social norms—laying groundwork for later feminist and educational reforms.

Explanation:
ক (chronology): She was born around the 1880s and, despite early marriage, pursued self-education (i). In 1905 she published 'Sultana's Dream', an imaginative feminist utopia (ii). She then worked to institutionalize girls' education by founding a school (iii). Through correspondence and bilingual writing she spread her ideas (v), campaigned for broader women's rights (iv), and died in 1932 leaving a continuing legacy (vi).

খ (incorrectness): The items are concise summaries of well-known facts; no statement is falsely stated. To be precise, giving the exact death year (1932) refines (vi).

গ (work and year): 'Sultana's Dream' (1905) is an early feminist fantasy in English that inverts gendered power structures to critique patriarchy and imagine alternative social order.

ঘ (contribution): By combining literary innovation with grassroots institution-building (a girls' school) and public advocacy, she opened educational opportunities for women and introduced feminist discourse into Bengali public life—an influence that persisted long after her death.

খ Earlier that morning the young sailor had been promoted for courage at a surprise skirmish. The sailor had asked an officer to deliver the letter if he did not return by dusk. "Please tell my mother I am safe," the sailor had written, "and that I sail with honour." He approached the barracks with a folded, rain-spattered letter in hand. The general unfolded the envelope and read in silence. The general had lost his own son at sea many years ago. The general looked up and, with a rare smile, ordered a lantern lit for the boy's coastal village.

গ সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা: কাহিনীতে দায়িত্ব, শূন্যতা ও সহানুভূতির মিল আছে। সাহসী কৃত্যের পরও সৈনিকের চিন্তা পরিবার ও নিরাপত্তার দিকে—এটি সাধারণিক মনকে স্পর্শ করে। জেনারেলের ব্যক্তিগত স্মৃতি সেই অনুরোধকে কাঁপিয়ে তোলে এবং সে ছোট্ট সহানুভূতিশীল কাজ করে, যা যুদ্ধের কঠোরতার মধ্যে মানবিকতার গুরুত্ব দেখায়।

গ: মানুষের অভিজ্ঞতা ও শোক কীভাবে অন্যের জন্য সদিচ্ছা অনুপ্রাণিত করে তা এই কাহিনী স্পষ্ট করে; যুদ্ধের মধ্যে মানবিকতা বজায় রাখাই মূল ভাব।

ঘ: (vii) সরাসরি জেনারেলের ব্যক্তিগত ব্যথা প্রকাশ করে এবং এই কারণেই সে লণ্ঠন জ্বালানোর মতো মৃদু কাজটি করে।

Question:
Arrange the jumbled sentences into a meaningful order to reveal the full incident.

(a) "How could a whale swallow that net?" the neighbour exclaimed.

(b) One evening a neighbour borrowed a fishing net from a fisherman.

(c) The neighbour later borrowed the fisherman's small boat and asked to take the fisherman's son along to help row.

(d) "The sea swallowed your net," said the neighbour when the fisherman asked for it back.

(e) After the trip the boat came back with the neighbour alone and the fisherman's son was missing.

(f) The fisherman was startled and asked, "Where is my son?"

(g) "A whale must have swallowed your son," said the neighbour.

(h) The fisherman's suspicion at first turned to anger, but then he calmly replied, "If the sea can swallow your net, perhaps a whale could have taken my son."

(i) A few days later the fisherman asked the neighbour to return the fishing net.

Options:
ক. বাক্যগুলোকে ক্রমানুসারে সাজান।
খ. কথ্যটিতে কার কৌতুকপূর্ণ প্রতিক্রিয়া প্রকৃত অপভাষাকে কীভাবে প্রকাশ করে তা ব্যাখ্যা করুন।
গ. বাক্য (h)-এ fisherman's calm reply-এর উদ্দেশ্য কী? সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা দিন।
ঘ. বক্তার উদ্দেশ্য ধরে নৈতিক শিক্ষা সংক্ষেপে লিখুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: (b) → (i) → (d) → (a) → (c) → (e) → (f) → (g) → (h)

খ উত্তর: কৌতুকপূর্ণ প্রতিক্রিয়া (নাবিকের বা fisherman's calm reply) আসলে সমানভাবে মিথ্যার জবাব; neighbour-মধ্যের "sea swallowed your net" ও পরবর্তীতে "a whale swallowed your son"—এই অদ্ভুত অজুহাতগুলোকে সমান করে দেখিয়ে fisherman নিজের ছেলের অনুপস্থিতি নিয়ে একই রকম বিস্ময় প্রয়োগ করে, ফলে মিথ্যার কৌতুক প্রকাশ পায়।

গ উত্তর: বাক্য (h)-এ fisherman's calm reply-এর উদ্দেশ্য ছিল মিথ্যাকে আয়নার মতো প্রতিফলিত করে দেখানো—অর্থাৎ তিনি neighbour-এর অযৌক্তিক অজুহাতটাকে একই তালে ফিরিয়ে দিলেন, ফলে neighbour-কে বিব্রত বা নিজের কথার অমার্জনীয়তা উপলব্ধ করানো।

ঘ উত্তর: নৈতিক শিক্ষা — মিথ্যা অজুহাত দেয়া সহজ, কিন্তু মিথ্যেকে মোকাবিলা করার জন্য চরম কৌতুক বা বিনয়ের ব্যবহার মিথ্যাবাজকে গ্লানি করতে পারে; সততা ও স্বচ্ছতা শ্রেয়।

Explanation:
Solution explanation:

ক (sequence) — (b) introduces the loan of the net. (i) follows when the owner asks for it back. The neighbour's strange excuse appears in (d). The fisherman's surprised retort (a) occurs then the neighbour asks to borrow the boat and the son in (c). After the trip the son is missing (e), prompting the fisherman to ask (f). The neighbour gives another far-fetched excuse (g) and the fisherman finally answers calmly in (h), reflecting the neighbour's earlier absurdity.

খ — The story uses irony and role-reversal to ridicule the liar's excuses; the fisherman answering in the same illogical mode highlights how untenable the neighbour's lies are.

গ — The calmness in (h) is strategic: by matching the neighbour's absurdity rather than reacting with heat, the fisherman exposes the lie more effectively.

ঘ — The moral reiterates that dishonesty invites embarrassment; speaking truthfully is socially and ethically better.

Question:
The sentences below are out of order. Put them in the correct sequence so the short tale reads sensibly.

(a) The gardener asked politely, "Can I have back my watering can?"

(b) After a while the gardener went to fetch his watering can which he had lent to the nursery owner.

(c) "Rust ate the hole in your can; I cannot return it," the nursery owner said.

(d) "Who would steal my apprentice?" cried the gardener.

(e) The gardener had lent his old but faithful watering can to a nearby nursery owner.

(f) The gardener sent his young apprentice to the nursery to help carry some plant pots, but the apprentice returned alone.

(g) The nursery owner replied, "A thief must have taken your apprentice."

(h) The gardener listened quietly to the nursery owner's excuses and then gave him a pointed reply: "Just as rust can eat a can, strange things can happen to people too."

Options:
ক. বাক্যগুলো সঠিক ক্রমে সাজান।
খ. বাক্য (h)-এর কথাটি কি নির্দেশ করে? সংক্ষিপ্ত ব্যাখ্যা দিন।
গ. এই কাহিনীর প্রকারভেদের উপর ভিত্তি করে একটি উপযুক্ত শিরোনাম ব্যাখ্যাসহ দিন।
ঘ. বাক্য (c) কে reported speech-এ রূপান্তর করুন।


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক উত্তর: (e) → (b) → (c) → (h) → (f) → (a) → (g) → (d)

খ উত্তর: বাক্য (h) নির্দেশ করে যে gardener-টি nursery owner-এর অজুহাতকে একই যুক্তিহীন মানদণ্ডে ফিরিয়ে দিয়েছে—এটি একটি ছলনাপূর্ণ বা ব্যঙ্গাত্মক প্রতিক্রিয়া যা মিথ্যার টোকা করে। তিনি শান্ত স্বরে তর্ক করে দেখিয়েছেন যে অযৌক্তিক অজুহাত মেনে নেওয়া যায় না।

গ উত্তর: উপযুক্ত শিরোনাম: "অজুহাত ও প্রতিবাদ" — কারণ গল্পটি একটি উপকরণের ক্ষতি সংক্রান্ত অসত্য অজুহাত এবং তার বিরুদ্ধে সুশৃঙ্খল, তীক্ষ্ণ প্রতিক্রিয়ার মাধ্যমে ন্যায় বা বিবেচনার দাবি তুলে ধরে।

ঘ উত্তর: Reported speech: The nursery owner said that rust had eaten a hole in the can and that he could not return it.



Explanation:
Solution explanation:

ক (sequence) — (e) sets the scene with the lending. (b) follows as the gardener later goes to fetch it. The nursery owner's excuse is (c). The gardener's pointed, ironic reply is (h), which underscores the absurdity of the excuse. Then (f) shows the apprentice being sent and returning alone, prompting the gardener's direct question (a). The nursery owner offers another excuse in (g), and finally the gardener's exasperated cry appears in (d).

খ — Sentence (h) is a rhetorical rejoinder: the gardener is not literally saying rust can harm people, but is using analogy to show the nursery owner's excuse is as implausible as claiming a person could vanish because of the same force. It's a moral rebuttal.

গ — The title "অজুহাত ও প্রতিবাদ" (Excuse and Rebuttal) captures the central conflict: an implausible excuse about an object and the measured, ironic response that reveals the lie.

ঘ — In reported speech we shift present tense to past: direct "Rust ate the hole in your can; I cannot return it," becomes: The nursery owner said that rust had eaten a hole in the can and that he could not return it.

ক উত্তর: (d) → (f) → (b) → (i) → (e) → (g) → (a) → (h) → (c)

খ উত্তর: প্রধান নৈতিক শিক্ষা — অসাধু বা মিথ্যাবাদী ব্যক্তির অদৃশ্য অপকারের স্বস্তি কেবল সাময়িক; মিথ্যা বললে শাস্তি বা আপত্তিজনক প্রতিফলন হতে পারে। সততা রাখাই দীর্ঘস্থায়ী সম্মানের পথ।

গ উত্তর: টার্নিং পয়েন্ট হলো বাক্য (e) — "The cloth seller said, 'I am going to the market tomorrow. Please send your daughter with me to help carry the bundles.'" কারণ এই প্রস্তাবের পরে-tailor-এর মিথ্যা ছদ্মবেশ (মেয়ের অনুপস্থিতি) প্রকাশ পায় এবং ঘটনার মূল সংঘাত শুরু হয়।

ঘ উত্তর: Reported speech: The cloth seller said that a gust of wind had carried his daughter away.



Explanation:
Solution explanation:

ক (sequence) — We begin with (d) because it sets the scene: the tailor borrows the measuring tape. Next (f) follows naturally when the owner asks for it back. The tailor offers (b) the excuse that moths ate the tape. The cloth seller's anger is described in (i). To test or expose the tailor, the cloth seller (e) asks that his daughter accompany him to the market. The tailor agrees and (g) the daughter goes but returns alone. The cloth seller (a) asks about her, and the tailor answers (h). Finally the cloth seller's comeback (c) and the implied irony conclude the story.

খ (moral) — The story is a classic example showing that unfair or dishonest behavior (here the tailor's false excuse) is often met with a clever retort that exposes the falsity; honesty is the better policy.

গ (turning point) — Sentence (e) is the turning point because until then the conflict was limited to a broken/lost object and an excuse. Inviting the daughter to accompany the seller creates a situation where the tailor's earlier lie can be tested and thus escalates the narrative.

ঘ (reported speech) — In converting direct speech to reported speech we shift tense and remove quotation marks; "A gust of wind carried your daughter away," becomes: The cloth seller said that a gust of wind had carried his daughter away.
