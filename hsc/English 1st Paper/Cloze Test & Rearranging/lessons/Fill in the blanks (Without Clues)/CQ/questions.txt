Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) lower/influence/degrade; (b) as; (c) warmth/affection/contentment; (d) sufferings/woes/miseries; (e) birth; (f) criticized/ rebuked/dishonoured; (g) disparity/discrimination; (h) at all/enough; (i) acknowledge/ensure; (j) the/all.

Explanation: "Tend to" takes a base verb like "worsen/degrade"; "regarded as" is the fixed pattern; "deep joy/affection" and "add to their burden" are common collocations; "giving birth" is the fixed phrase and the mother is usually "blamed" (passive). "Gender discrimination" is the standard noun, "not smooth sailing" is an idiom, and we "raise/enhance the dignified status of (the/all) the women of our country."

(a) strong; (b) that; (c) temperature/warming; (d) by; (e) around; (f) believe/assert; (g) cause; (h) beings/civilization; (i) reduce/hamper, (j) ability.

Explanation:
All the choices follow common collocations and grammar: use an adjective like "ample" or "strong" with "evidence" and then "that" to introduce the clause, so (a) = ample/strong and (b) = that. The phrase is "increase in global temperatures" (c = temperatures) and the passive needs "by" (d = by); carbon dioxide is present around/in the earth's atmosphere (e = around/in). Finally, scientists "agree" (f) that the greenhouse effect is the likely "cause" (g); it can harm human "health" (h) and "affect" (i) mankind’s "ability" (j) to grow food.

Adolescents (a) — on their (b) — their communities, schools, health services and their workplaces to (c) — a wide range of skills that can (d) — them to cope with the (e) — they face and make a successful transition from (f) — to adulthood. Parents, members (g) — the community service providers, and (h) — institutions have the (i) — to both promote adolescent development and adjustment and to intervene (j) — when problems arise.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) rely/depend; (b) families; (c) learn/acquire/attain; (d) enable/assist/help; (e) pressures/challenges/obstacles; (f) childhood; (g) of; (h) social/educational; (i) responsibility; (j) successfully/effectively.

Explanation:
Because adolescents depend on the people and institutions around them, "rely on" (or "depend on") fits for (a) and "families/communities/schools" are the natural agents that can "provide" (c) skills. "Enable" (d) is correct because it means giving the ability to do something, and "challenges" (e) correctly names the problems they must cope with while moving from "childhood" (f) to adulthood. In the second sentence, "of" links "members" to "the community," "educational" or similar describes the type of institutions (h), "responsibility" (i) is the correct noun after "have," and "early" (j) properly modifies "intervene" to show timely action.

Question:
We know that all species are (a) — for maintaining ecological balance. If one is (b) — the whole natural environment (c) —.

Explanation:
Explanation: Every species plays a role in ecosystem functions (like pollination, predation and nutrient cycling), so the loss of one species can upset food chains and ecological balance. That upset can cascade through the environment, harming other species and ecosystem services we rely on, so protecting wildlife helps preserve the whole natural system. Conserving wild species and treating animals kindly therefore supports both nature’s health and human well‑being.

These choices follow usual grammar and collocations: an adverb ("strictly") modifies "followed"; "safety record" is the fixed phrase; "comply with" + "rules laid down" is standard wording; a relative pronoun ("which/that") introduces the clause about coaches, and vehicles are "fitted with" equipment; "law enforcement agencies" is the correct compound, described as "strict"; finally "safest" is the superlative describing the best "form of road transport."

Dream is a series of thoughts, images and sensations occurring in a person's mind during sleep. Dream is a (a) — of unconscious wishes, thoughts and imaginations. It (b) — be sweet or horrible. When we dream (c) — pleasant, we call it a sweet dream. (d) — when we dream something extremely bad, we (e) — it a nightmare. Dream is meaningless if (f) — is a day dream.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a) representation/expression/reflection; b) may/can; c) something/anything; d) But; e) call; f) it; g) a; h) mental/ psychological; i) of; j) and.

Explanation:
Answers: a manifestation, b can, c something, d But, e call, f it, g a, h mental, i of, j and.  
'Manifestation' fits the meaning of a dream as an expression of unconscious wishes; 'can' shows possibility; 'something' and 'it' are the correct pronouns for the objects.  
'But' gives the contrast, 'call' is the verb used to name a nightmare, 'a' is the article before "real purpose", 'mental' completes the triad "mental, emotional and physical", while 'of' links "benefit of dream" and 'and' joins "thoughts and ideas".

Answers: (a) habits, (b) addicted, (c) foods, (d) contain, (e) junk, (f) vitamins, (g) risk, (h) diseases, (i) lead, (j) careful.

These choices fit both meaning and grammar: "food habits" is the correct collocation, "addicted to" shows dependence, "foods" matches the examples, "contain" denotes having high levels, "junk" names unhealthy food, "vitamins" pairs with fibre and minerals, "risk of chronic diseases" is the proper phrase, "lead to" shows causation with obesity, and "careful" is the appropriate adjective for caution.

The preposition (c) "for" fits "movement for democracy" and (d) "widespread" describes how it spread; (f) "also" links another negative development. (g) "birth" (or "creation") names Bangladesh's coming into being and takes the singular past verb (h) "was"; (i) "bloody" describes the war, and (j) "hold" completes the idiom "hold our heads high."

Question:
Beauty is easy to appreciate but difficult to define. If we look around, we will discover beauty in (a) — objects and sights in nature, in the (b) — of children, in kindness of strangers. But asked to define, we run into (c) —. Does beauty have an independent identity? Is it (d) — or relative? Is it dependent on our sense of (e) —? Does it lie in the (f) — of the beholder? Thus there will arise a number of (g) — in our mind. However, poets, artists, philosophers and thinkers (h) — always in search of beauty in their works and arts. But most of them have the common and undisputed opinion that where there is beauty, there is (i) — that is, a thing of beauty is a joy (j) —.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
(a) pleasurable; (b) laughter; (c) difficulties; (d) universal; (e) perceptions; (f) eye; (g) questions; (h) are; (i) joy; (j) for ever.

Explanation:
Explanation: The chosen words fit the natural phrases and ideas in the passage—beauty can be found in "everyday" objects and the "innocence" of children, and asking for a strict definition leads to "difficulties." The contrast "absolute or relative" suits (d) because the sentence poses a philosophical choice, and (e) "taste" and (f) "eye" match common usage ("sense of taste", "eye of the beholder"). (g) "questions" follows logically, (h) "are" agrees with the plural subject, and (i) "joy" with (j) "forever" echoes Keats' line "a thing of beauty is a joy forever," which explains the closing idea.

These choices fit both grammar and meaning: "sure of making" is the correct collocation, "know that" introduces the clause, "key to success" is the fixed phrase, "not sincere ... can never go a long way" is idiomatic, "value of sincerity" and "make a good use of" are proper collocations, "sincerely" is the adverb modifying "do work", "are sincere" matches subject–verb agreement, and "surely" correctly modifies "will be prosperous."

Explanation:
Explanation: The word "father" fits (a) because of the proverb "the child is the father of the man," meaning a child shapes the adult they become. "Future" for (b) and "nation" for (d) with "education" for (e) make sense because a country's future depends on children’s proper education. "Duty" (f) shows responsibility and "latent" (g) describes hidden talents that must be roused. Finally, "essential" (h), "grows up" (i) and "possible" (j) complete the idea that a sound environment is necessary for a child’s full growth, and only then is it possible to build a developed country.

The Padma Bridge is a multi-purpose road-rail bridge over the (a) mighty/powerful Padma river in Bangladesh. It is the longest bridge in Bangladesh. At first the World Bank intended to (b) invest/spend for the construction of the bridge and later (c) overturned/withdrew their decision.

(b) fund — "intended to fund" means to provide money for construction, which matches the context.  
(c) reversed — "reversed their decision" is the correct phrase when an organization cancels or changes a prior decision.  
(d) foreign — "without foreign aid" indicates the project was built with domestic funding rather than external assistance.  
(e) overcoming — "after overcoming various uncertainties" explains that challenges were resolved before completion.  
(f) inaugurated — "was inaugurated" is the formal verb for officially opening a major project such as a bridge.

Correct answers: (a) all over, (b) as, (c) second, (d) companies, (e) communication, (f) with, (g) printed (or published), (h) are, (i) wise, (j) important. These fit because "all over/throughout the world" shows location; "use it as a first language" is the normal phrase and "second language" contrasts with first; companies need English "for communication" and people are employed "with" adequate knowledge. "Printed/published" describes adverts in dailies and "are" links them to "in English", while "wise to neglect" and "important language" are common collocations.

In fact, bilingual and multilingual users of English far (f) - its monolingual native speakers. This phenomenon has led to a (g) variety of English around the world.

World English has now (j)-away from the control of its native speakers.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
Ans to the Q. no. 5.[math]\\[/math](a) achieved; (b) prestige; (c) crossed; (d) unique/sole; (e) belongs; (f) outnumber, (g) bewildering; (h) emerged; (i) respective; (j) moved

Explanation:
The phrase "acquired the status" is a common collocation meaning English has become that language, and "crossed national borders" correctly describes it spreading beyond countries. "Exclusive possession" fits the idea of ownership by native speakers, so "belongs" (to the world's people) and "outnumber" (bilingual users exceed monolingual natives) match the intended meaning. Finally, "a wide variety" expresses growing diversity, "have emerged" shows new varieties appearing, "respective" refers to each group's own mother tongues, and "moved away" indicates World English is no longer under native-speaker control.

Explanation:
Filled words: (a) situated, (b) from, (c) tourist, (d) natural, (e) vegetation, (f) comes, (g) drinking, (h) view, (i) same spot, (j) ideal.

Explanation:
The correct words are: (a) preparation, (b) fit, (c) is, (d) studies, (e) does, (f) other hand, (g) poor, (h) borne, (i) lost, (j) long.  
"Preparation" shows purpose for future struggle and "fit" follows the pattern "make him fit for"; "is" completes the clause about duty, while "studies" and "does" are the correct verbs ("he who studies... does well").  
"On the other hand" is the standard contrast phrase and "cuts a poor figure" means appears unsuccessful; "borne in mind" is the idiom for remembering, "lost time" is the usual collocation, and "long run" denotes future consequences.

Answers: (a) role, (b) moment, (c) until, (d) think, (e) dislike, (f) give, (g) always, (h) essential.

Each choice follows common collocations and grammar: "plays a very important role" is the usual phrase; "from the moment ... until" correctly shows the time span; "express what we think" and "say what we like or dislike" keep parallel meaning; "give information" is the natural verb-object pair; and "always present" and "essential part" correctly describe something necessary and ever-present in our lives.

In recent years, there have been many alarming reports that the world's climate is undergoing a significant change. All these reports provide (a)-----evidence that world's temperatures are increasing day by day. This increase in global (b)----- is caused (c)----- increased amount of carbon-di-oxide (d) ----- the earth. Most climatologists (e)------ that green house effect is the likely cause of this global warming. It may harm human (f)------ seriously.

Options:


Correct Answer: a) strong; b) temperature; c) by; d) around; e) state; f) lives; g) affect/destroy; h) ability/power.

Solution:
a) strong; b) temperature; c) by; d) around; e) state; f) lives; g) affect/destroy; h) ability/power.

Explanation:
Explanation: 
a) "strong" fits because "evidence" is usually uncountable and is described by adjectives like "strong" or "compelling" (not "many"). b) "temperature" refers to the global average temperature rise. c) "by" is the correct preposition with "caused". d) "around" means "surrounding the earth". e) "state" (i.e. say/claim) is the formal verb scientists use. f) "lives" is what can be harmed. g) "affect" or "destroy" are appropriate verbs depending on severity. h) "ability" (or "power") correctly names mankind's capacity to grow food.

Question:
Civility means polite (a)----- or modesty. It also (b)------ courteous manner. It is a great virtue (c)------ a man. To be well- behaved, or good-natured, we need not (d)----- money. We have to (e)------- willingness to attain civility. We have to (f)----- some code of conduct and (g)------ the norms of etiquette of the society. It (h)----- from society to society. However, one has to practise good manner in one's character from an early age. No expenditure but consciousness is required.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a) gesture/behaviour; b) means/indicates; c) of; d) spend; e) have/show; f) follow; g) learn; h) varies.

Explanation:
Explanation: "Behaviour" fits (a) because "polite behaviour" is the correct collocation and parallels the noun "modesty." "Implies" fits (b) as a verb meaning "suggests," while "in" fits (c) because we say a virtue is "in a man"; "spend" fits (d) since being well-behaved does not require spending money. "Show" fits (e) for expressing willingness, and "follow" (f) and "observe" (g) correctly collocate with "code of conduct" and "norms of etiquette"; "varies" (h) is right because manners differ "from society to society."

Question:
In recent years there have been many alarming reports that world's climate is undergoing a significant change. All these reports provide (a)----- evidence (b) ------- world's temperatures are increasing day by day. This increase in global (c)----- is caused (d)----- increased amounts of carbon dioxide (e)------ the earth. Most climatologists (f). ------that greenhouse effect is the likely (g)----- of this global warming. It may harm human (h)-----seriously.

Options:


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
a) clear/strong; b) that; c) temperature; d) by; e) around; f) state/ agree; g) cause; h) lives.

Explanation:
The best fits are: "compelling" for (a) because it describes strong evidence, and "that the" for (b) to introduce the clause about the world's temperatures; "temperature" (c) names what is rising, with "by" (d) the correct preposition after "caused" and "in" (e) showing location (the atmosphere). "Agree" (f) expresses climatologists' consensus, "cause" (g) names the reason, and "health" (h) is what global warming may seriously harm—so the sentence correctly links increased CO2 in the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect, and risks to human health.

Solution:
a) Follow/adopt; b) masks; c) from; d) necessity/importance; e) cultivated/ kept; f) general/fruitful; g) study/ educational; h) utilize.

Explanation:
Correct fills: (a) follow — a verb meaning obey rules; (b) masks — the plural noun for what students wear; (c) from — the preposition that pairs with "aloof" to show separation; (d) importance — a noun showing what they are aware of; (e) maintained — a past-participial adjective meaning kept up continuously; (f) sound — an adjective describing the kind of education; (g) hygienic — an adjective modifying "environment"; (h) seize — a verb meaning take advantage of an opportunity. These choices match both the grammar (word class and collocation) and the intended meaning of each sentence.

Question:
Urban life after the pandemic saw shifts in public policy and personal choices: city planners prioritized (ক)_____ spaces, businesses encouraged (খ)_____ schedules to reduce rush crowds, vaccination campaigns sought to (গ)_____ immunity in the population, and people were reminded of the (ঘ)_____ of preparedness for future crises.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (ক)
খ. Fill the blank (খ)
গ. Fill the blank (গ)
ঘ. Fill the blank (ঘ)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক open / green — "open spaces" or "green spaces" are prioritized to allow safer outdoor activities and better ventilation in public areas. 

খ staggered / flexible — "staggered" or "flexible" schedules (e.g., flexible work hours or shifts) reduce peak overcrowding. 

গ build / achieve — "build immunity" or "achieve herd immunity" are phrases used in public-health contexts; "build" is general and acceptable here. 

ঘ necessity / value — "necessity" or "importance" of preparedness underscores learning that planning and readiness are essential for future emergencies.

Explanation:
This context focuses on long-term adjustments. (ক) requires the type of public space emphasized — "open" or "green" spaces provide safer environments. (খ) needs an adjective describing schedule changes to avoid crowding; "staggered" or "flexible" are commonly used. (গ) is about increasing population-level protection; verbs like "build" or phrases like "achieve herd immunity" fit depending on specificity. (ঘ) calls for an abstract noun highlighting the lesson: "necessity" or "importance" of preparedness.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (ক)
খ. Fill the blank (খ)
গ. Fill the blank (গ)
ঘ. Fill the blank (ঘ)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক health / screening — "health checks" or "screening checks" (temperature and symptom screening) is appropriate because institutions screened entrants to prevent infections. 

খ masks / face coverings — "masks" or "face coverings" is the direct, correct practice for reducing airborne spread. 

গ adopted / deployed — "adopted" or "deployed" fits: schools and workplaces adopted online platforms and tools to continue activities remotely. 

ঘ importance / significance — The blank requires a noun reflecting emphasis; "importance" or "significance" of mental and physical wellbeing conveys that both were prioritized.

Explanation:
The sentence lists institutional responses. (ক) should denote practical entry controls: "health checks" or "screening". (খ) clearly refers to protective equipment: "masks". (গ) asks for a verb meaning to start using technology broadly — "adopted" or "deployed". (ঘ) needs an abstract noun summarizing the lesson that mental health matters as much as physical health: "importance" or "significance" are correct and natural choices.

Options:
ক. Fill the blank (ক)
খ. Fill the blank (খ)
গ. Fill the blank (গ)
ঘ. Fill the blank (ঘ)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক adopt new habits — Households had to adopt or modify habits (like frequent cleaning and handwashing) to reduce transmission. 

খ private transport / cycling / walking — Many commuters shifted to private transport, cycling, or walking to avoid crowded buses and trains; any of these options fit depending on context, but "private transport" is concise. 

গ social distancing / hygiene practices — Communities emphasized social distancing and improved hygiene (mask-wearing, sanitizing) to protect high-risk groups. 

ঘ importance / value — The crisis revealed the importance (or value) of collective responsibility and public health measures; either word conveys the intended meaning.

Explanation:
Each blank asks for a concise noun or verb phrase describing behavioral shifts during the pandemic. For (ক) a verb like "adopt" or "modify" fits because people changed habits. For (খ) a mode of transport that reduces contact works; "private transport" is broad and correct. For (গ) the phrase should name the protective measures — "social distancing" or "hygiene practices". For (ঘ) the blank needs an abstract noun conveying significance — "importance" or "value" — since the sentence points to a lesson learned about communal health.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:

খ (a) in; (b) find; (c) avoid

গ (a) require; (b) attend; (c) use; (d) improve

ঘ (a) seek; (b) manage; (c) hence; (d) strong

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'feel uncertain' describes the traveler's emotional state on approaching unfamiliar places; 'feel lost' or 'feel uncertain' are natural collocations. (b) 'consult' fits with maps and guidebooks — one consults a map. (c) 'interact' means to communicate or engage with locals, which helps gather information. (d) 'plan' (or 'map out') their routes is the intended result of consulting and interacting.

খ: (a) 'in' is the correct preposition: signs are 'displayed in several languages'. (b) 'find' is used with 'directions' — passengers 'find directions' easily. (c) 'avoid' completes the idea: multilingual signage helps people avoid confusion.

গ: (a) 'require' is appropriate: successful learners require regular practice. (b) 'attend' collocates with 'classes' — learners attend classes. (c) 'use' fits for 'online resources'. (d) 'improve' is the goal of practice and using resources: to improve skills.

ঘ: (a) 'seek' is commonly used with 'employees' in hiring contexts. (b) 'manage' suits 'cross-cultural teams' — employees should be able to manage or work in them. (c) 'hence' links the cause and effect: because they need such employees, hence they prefer... (d) 'strong' modifies 'communication skills' to indicate the desirable level.

Each chosen word is selected for natural collocation and grammatical fit in the sentence. Alternatives (e.g., 'consult' ↔ 'refer to'; 'in' ↔ 'among' for signage) may also work, but the provided words are the most straightforward and idiomatic in context.

Nightmares are emotionally intense dreams that often feel threatening. A nightmare (a) ______ terrifying enough to wake a person suddenly. After waking (b) ______, many people feel scared or unsettled. If nightmares become frequent they can (c) ______ the overall quality of sleep and daytime performance. Clinicians sometimes (d) ______ techniques such as imagery rehearsal or controlled exposure to reduce nightmare frequency.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a): choose the correct verb form (is/are/feel)
খ. Fill blank (b): complete the phrase (up/from/around)
গ. Fill blank (c): choose the verb that fits (impair/interrupt/enhance)
ঘ. Fill blank (d): choose the verb (use/apply/recommend)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক is
খ up / from (wake up from)
গ impair / disrupt
ঘ use / apply / recommend

Explanation:
ক: “Nightmare” is singular so the correct verb is “is.” “Feel” would change the sentence structure and require a different construction (e.g., “that feel terrifying”). খ: The common collocation is “wake up from a nightmare,” so “up” completes the phrasal verb and “from” indicates source. গ: Frequent nightmares tend to harm sleep and daytime functioning — verbs like “impair” or “disrupt” capture that negative effect; “enhance” would be incorrect. ঘ: Clinicians may “use,” “apply,” or “recommend” specific therapeutic techniques; each verb works depending on nuance (direct application versus suggestion). The explanations show grammatical agreement (singular/plural), correct phrasal verbs, and appropriate semantic choices for clinical context.

REM periods (b) ______ several times during a normal night's sleep, becoming longer toward morning. Insufficient REM sleep (c) ______ memory consolidation and emotional regulation. Therefore, consistent restorative sleep (d) ______ important for learning and mental health.

Options:
ক. Fill blank (a): a linking phrase (when/during which/where)
খ. Fill blank (b): choose a verb that shows repetition (occurs/recur/happen)
গ. Fill blank (c): choose the correct modal or verb phrase (may/does/can impair)
ঘ. Fill blank (d): choose the correct verb (is/remains/turns)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক during which / when
খ recur / occur
গ can impair / may impair
ঘ is / remains

Explanation:
ক: “during which” or “when” correctly links REM sleep to the occurrence of vivid dreams; “where” would be less precise for a temporal stage. খ: “recur” or “occur” both indicate repetition across the night — REM periods recur multiple times. গ: “can impair” or “may impair” conveys possibility that lack of REM negatively affects memory consolidation; using a modal is appropriate because the effect can vary among individuals. ঘ: “is” or “remains” fits naturally: consistent restorative sleep is important (simple present states the general truth). The chosen words preserve grammatical correctness and the intended scientific nuance about sleep stages and cognitive effects.

খ. Fill blank (b): choose the appropriate modal verb (may/can/is)
গ. Fill blank (c): choose an appropriate verb (provides/acts/serves) or phrase
ঘ. Fill blank (d): complete the phrase (to discover/to imagine/to create)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক faculty / ability
খ can / may
গ provides / acts as the
ঘ to create / to discover

Explanation:
ক: Both “faculty” and “ability” are suitable because they mean a mental power or capacity — imagination is a mental faculty that enables visualization of things not present. খ: “can” or “may” are correct modals here because they express potential: imagination can/may be cultivated; “is” would state it as a fact rather than possibility. গ: Verbs like “provides,” “acts as,” or the phrase “serves as the” fit: imagination provides (or acts as) the spark for breakthroughs. ঘ: Phrases such as “to create” or “to discover” complete the sense that imagination helps produce new possibilities; either gerund/infinitive works depending on style. The choices are interchangeable where synonyms are offered; the explanations clarify grammatical role and nuance of modality and noun selection.

Explanation:
ক: (a) 'incorporate' is commonly used for classrooms bringing digital tools into teaching. (b) 'use' is the neutral verb for employing presentations and videos. (c) 'educational' modifies 'apps' to clarify purpose. (d) 'make' fits with 'make lessons more engaging.'

খ: (a) 'learn' to use platforms is the necessary action by students. (b) 'gain' access means they obtain additional resources. (c) 'join' peer discussion forums is the natural collocation.

গ: (a) 'includes' lists elements of a good routine. (b) 'regular' describes the type of review sessions. (c) 'strengthens' indicates the effect on memory over time (i.e., spaced repetition improves retention).

গ (d) sparked debates / fueled debates; (f) introduced regulations / enacted rules

ঘ (e) depleted / consumed; (g) left / created a mixed legacy of progress and problems

Explanation:

গ (d) found / found applications in both civilian and military fields (or "had both civilian and military applications"); (e) precipitated / caused long-lasting humanitarian crises

ঘ (f) accelerated / became more rapid due to improved travel and global media

Explanation:
ক: Empires "dissolving" or "collapsing" is standard when they lose control; new nations "appearing on" or "redrawing" the map describes emergence and border changes.

খ: (c) needs a phrase showing how the Cold War affected international relations. "Intensified alliances and deepened rivalries" succinctly conveys both strengthening of blocs and increased hostility.

গ: (d) requires a wording that indicates dual-purpose technology—"had both civilian and military applications" or "found applications in both...". For (e), verbs like "precipitated" or "caused" clearly link conflicts to humanitarian crises.

ঘ: (f) is about speed of cultural exchange: "accelerated" or "became more rapid" are appropriate verbs; adding "due to improved travel and global media" explains the mechanism.

খ (c) were automated / became automated; (d) were / have been created in tech sectors / grew

গ (e) prompted / forced governments and consumers to rethink rules / raised concerns that led to regulatory reviews

ঘ Summary: Digital networks enabled instant global information flow, transformed economies by opening new markets, automated some jobs while creating others, and triggered debates over privacy and regulation.

Explanation:
ক: For (a) verbs like "flowed", "spread" or "traveled" convey rapid movement of information; adding "instantly" emphasizes speed. For (b) "created" or "opened up" are natural collocations describing economic change.

খ: (c) uses passive voice often because jobs are acted upon by automation—"were automated" or "became automated." (d) can use passive or active forms—"were created" or "grew"—to indicate job creation in tech.

গ: (e) must show cause and response: "prompted" or "raised concerns that led to regulatory reviews" explain how privacy/data issues moved stakeholders to act.

ক. Fill blank (a).
খ. Fill blank (b).
গ. Fill blank (c).
ঘ. Fill blank (d).


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক acts
খ waste

Explanation:
ক (acts): The clause reads "A person who (a) without a plan..." The verb "acts" (or "acts" + without a plan) correctly completes the sentence to mean someone who takes action without planning.

খ (waste): "may (b) valuable hours" — the verb that fits naturally is "waste." It conveys losing time because of lack of planning.

গ (prioritize): "Those who (c) their tasks clearly" — "prioritize" fits best: to set tasks in order of importance, matching the meaning of clear task-setting.

ঘ (persevere): "and (d) even when progress is slow" — "persevere" (continue steadily) completes the idea of persisting despite slow progress and logically leads to reaching aims.

Question:
Australia's civil aviation framework emphasizes passenger safety through regulation, regular inspections and clear in-flight procedures. Airlines must provide safety information, ensure that equipment is maintained and enforce seatbelt rules — particularly for young children.

Options:
ক. Before takeoff, passengers receive a safety (____) that demonstrates emergency procedures.
খ. Aircraft are subject to routine maintenance checks (____) by aviation authorities.
গ. Children under two are sometimes required to be (____) in approved child restraints during takeoff and landing.
ঘ. Civil aviation regulators in Australia are known to be (____), which helps sustain a high safety record.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক briefing
খ inspected
গ secured
ঘ stringent

Explanation:
ক — 'briefing' is the standard term for the pre-flight safety presentation or demonstration given to passengers.

খ — 'inspected' indicates that aviation authorities carry out checks on aircraft; 'inspected' highlights the active checking process. Alternatives like 'conducted' (as in 'checks are conducted') are possible, but 'inspected' directly describes the action on aircraft.

গ — 'secured' conveys that children are fastened or restrained safely in approved devices. It pairs naturally with 'in approved child restraints.'

ঘ — 'stringent' describes strict, rigorous regulation and oversight. Calling regulators 'stringent' explains why safety standards are high; synonyms could include 'rigorous' or 'strict', but 'stringent' is a precise, formal fit for regulatory contexts.

খ — 'reinforced' indicates that signage strengthens or supports the behavioural expectations set by announcements and codes. It implies repeated reminders and visible cues.

গ — 'reserved' is commonly used for seats set aside for certain groups (e.g., 'reserved seating'); it indicates those seats are designated for elderly/disabled passengers.

ঘ — 'monitored' means observed or watched, typically by cameras and staff; it's the appropriate verb to describe stations under surveillance to deter crime and manage safety.

Question:
In Amsterdam, cycling is an everyday mode of travel. The city has invested heavily in segregated bike lanes, clear signage and rental systems. Local rules require lights at night and impose fines for reckless riding. As a result, many consider Amsterdam one of the models for urban cycling safety.

Options:
ক. Cycling infrastructure in Amsterdam is considered one of the (____) in the world.
খ. Cyclists must use lights after dusk; this rule is (____) by local ordinances.
গ. Rental bikes are usually (____) with front and rear lights and bells.
ঘ. Police and traffic wardens are (____) in ensuring compliance on busy routes.


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক safest
খ mandated
গ equipped
ঘ vigilant

Explanation:
ক — 'safest' fits because the sentence compares Amsterdam's cycling infrastructure to others and asserts it ranks among the top in safety. 'Safe' would be an adjective but the superlative 'safest' matches 'one of the'.

খ — 'mandated' means legally required; local ordinances mandate the use of lights. Alternatives like 'required' or 'enforced' could work, but 'mandated' emphasizes a legal obligation.

গ — 'equipped' is used with 'with' to indicate that rental bikes come supplied with lights and bells. Other verbs like 'fitted' or 'provided' are possible, but 'equipped' is the most natural collocation here.

ঘ — 'vigilant' describes an attentive, watchful attitude appropriate for police and wardens tasked with ensuring compliance. Words like 'active' or 'diligent' are also plausible, but 'vigilant' conveys alert enforcement.

Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক essential / indispensable / crucial
খ decline / drop / decrease
গ reduce / lower / threaten

Explanation:
ক (a): Pollinators are 'essential' or 'indispensable' for pollination, without which many fruit and seed-bearing plants cannot reproduce effectively.

খ (b): Reports describe a 'decline' (or 'drop'/'decrease') in pollinator populations worldwide, driven by multiple stressors.

গ (c): Fewer pollinators typically 'reduce' or 'lower' crop yields and can 'threaten' the diversity of foods produced by plants that rely on pollination.

ঘ (d): Positive responses include actions to 'conserve' existing pollinator habitat, 'restore' degraded sites, or 'create' flower-rich margins and hedgerows; all help pollinator populations recover while minimizing pesticide harm.

Options:
ক. (a) —
খ. (b) —
গ. (c) —
ঘ. (d) —


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক absorb / sequester
খ support / maintain
গ protect / prevent
ঘ cleared / deforested / removed

Explanation:
ক (a): Forests take in atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store carbon in biomass and soils. Both 'absorb' and 'sequester' accurately describe this function.

খ (b): Forests provide habitat and ecological niches for many species; verbs like 'support' or 'maintain' biodiversity fit because they indicate sustaining species richness.

গ (c): One of the ecosystem services of forests is stabilizing soil and reducing surface runoff, so 'protect' or 'prevent' (as in 'prevent erosion') are appropriate.

ঘ (d): When trees are removed the typical verbs are 'cleared', 'deforested' or 'removed'. These convey the human-driven loss of forest cover and match the harmful activities described (timber, agriculture).

Experts recommend that communities (c)_____ wildflower strips and hedgerows and (d)_____ the use of broad‑spectrum insecticides to help pollinator recovery.

Options:
ক. Fill (a): a verb (present tense) meaning 'threaten' or 'reduce' (one word)
খ. Fill (b): an adverb or phrase meaning 'especially' or 'more than others' (one or two words)
গ. Fill (c): a verb in imperative or infinitive form meaning 'create or restore' (one word)
ঘ. Fill (d): a verb meaning 'limit or phase out' (base form)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক threatens
খ are especially
গ restore
ঘ restrict

Explanation:
ক: 'threatens' suits the singular subject 'Loss of habitat and pesticide exposure' when treated as a collective cause; it conveys the danger to pollination services.
খ: 'are especially' indicates that smallholders are more vulnerable compared with others; depending on style 'are particularly' or simply 'particularly' could be used.
গ: 'restore' is an appropriate verb for actions like recreating wildflower strips and hedgerows that support pollinators; 'create' or 'establish' are alternatives.
ঘ: 'restrict' accurately expresses limiting the use of broad‑spectrum insecticides; 'phase out' or 'limit' would also be correct. The choices produce a clear, policy‑oriented paragraph on supporting pollinators and protecting crops.

ঘ. Fill (d): a verb meaning 'provide or create' (plural or base form appropriate for 'incentives')


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক exceed
খ is associated with
গ increase
ঘ offer

Explanation:
ক: 'exceed' is the correct present‑tense verb meaning 'go beyond' the recommended safe limits; it fits the subject 'concentrations'.
খ: 'is associated with' is a common, scientifically cautious phrase linking exposure to health outcomes; alternatives like 'increase' or 'raise' the risk would be stronger but 'is associated with' is accurate for epidemiological findings.
গ: 'increase' as a verb (e.g., 'increase investment') correctly expresses allocating more funds toward clean transit.
ঘ: 'offer' fits with 'incentives'—governments 'offer incentives' is the standard collocation. 'Provide' would also work. The chosen words make the paragraph clear, grammatically sound, and appropriate for policy discussion.

Urban planners warn that seawalls and natural buffers must be (c)_____ if communities are to be protected; otherwise, low‑lying districts will be (d)_____ by more frequent inundation.

Options:
ক. Fill (a): a noun or gerund meaning 'the process of glaciers losing ice' (one word)
খ. Fill (b): a verb phrase that links cause to effect (e.g., 'result in' / 'lead to')
গ. Fill (c): an adjective meaning 'made stronger or improved' (one word)
ঘ. Fill (d): an adjective meaning 'affected by flooding' (one word)


Correct Answer: 

Solution:
ক melting
খ are raising
গ strengthened
ঘ inundated

Explanation:
ক: 'melting' is the gerund/noun that describes glaciers losing ice, and it fits grammatically before 'of glaciers'.
খ: 'are raising' correctly links the processes (melting and thermal expansion) to their effect on sea levels in the present progressive sense that these processes are happening now. Alternatives like 'are causing' or 'are driving' would also be acceptable depending on nuance.
গ: 'strengthened' is the past participle used as an adjective to mean 'made stronger or reinforced'—appropriate for describing seawalls and buffers.
ঘ: 'inundated' is the conventional adjective meaning 'flooded' and matches the context of districts being overwhelmed by water. Together the chosen words produce a natural, grammatically coherent sentence describing ongoing coastal risk and required responses.
